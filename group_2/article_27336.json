      "content": "Blend together yellow and blue paint. Pour equal amounts of pure blue and pure yellow into a paint dish or onto a paint palette. Use a palette knife to thoroughly mix the colors together. When mixed, the original colors should produce a basic green, explains Hattas Wilson. To get a more accurate idea of how this green will look in your project, use a paint brush to apply a small amount to some scrap practice paper."

      "content": "Vary the proportions of blue and yellow. Depending on what you want to paint, pure green may not be the best green for your purposes. The simplest way to change the hue will be to add more yellow or more blue. Adding more yellow will create a warmer green, and adding more blue will produce a cooler green. When attempting to change the hue, make small changes until you find the hue you want. Gradually building the correct hue is easier and less wasteful than overcompensating and needing to work back from the extreme."

      "content": "Experiment with different yellows and blues. Clear room on your palette and try mixing together several different hues of yellow and blue. Doing so should produce different hues of green. [1] X Research source Pure yellow and pure blue will create pure green, but if these starting colors have been altered prior to being mixed, the resulting color will also change. For instance, combining golden yellow with a standard blue may result in a more muted, brownish green. On the other hand, mixing standard yellow with a light blue could produce a light green. The best way to learn which blues and yellows produce which greens is through experimentation. Pick a few different hues of yellow and blue. Combine equal parts of one yellow and one blue hue, working through each possible combination. Mark down your results for future reference. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try mixing different greens. If you have two hues of green that are close to the color you need but don't quite match it, you can try mixing the two hues together to achieve the desired color. Since all greens contain elements of blue and yellow, mixing them should result in new hues of green. You can also mix green together with different yellows or different blues to change the hue more dramatically."

      "content": "Change the value of your green using black or white paint. Once you find the right hue, you can alter the value (the color’s relative lightness or darkness) without changing the hue itself by adding some black or white paint. [3] X Research source Hattas Wilson also explains that adding black or white dulls the color, so you’ll end up with a more muted version of the green you originally mixed. Add white paint to create a lighter tint or black paint to create a darker shade. Regardless of which value you desire, add the white or black paint in small amounts. If you add too much, you can easily create a value that’s too light or too dark."

      "content": "Set up several sample dishes with white icing. There's more than one way to create green icing, and there's also more than one hue of green you can create. Experimenting with several options at once will allow you to learn more about the process. You need at least four sample dishes, but the experiment will be more effective if you set up six to twelve dishes. Place 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of white icing in each dish. Keep track of how much icing you use since it has an impact on the amount of food coloring you'll need. Obtain at least four food dye colors: one green, one yellow, one blue, and one black. You can also get other hues of green, yellow, or blue to experiment with. Paste, powder, and gel food dyes are designed for coloring frosting, so work with these types of dyes when possible since they should not alter the consistency of the frosting. Liquid dyes only work when you need very light tints; otherwise, the amount of liquid food coloring you'll need to create a vibrant hue will change the consistency of the frosting.

      "content": "Add green food dye to one dish. Dip a toothpick into the green food coloring, then dunk the same toothpick into one dish of white frosting to transfer the dye. Mix until evenly blended. To get an accurate idea of the color you've created, you'll need to continue mixing until you can no longer see any remaining green streaks in the frosting. The type of green dye you use will affect the color of the icing. For instance, using \"moss green\" dye will create a warmer color than \"kelly green\" dye or \"leaf green\" dye. The amount of food coloring will affect the shade. Since the icing is white, using small amounts of green dye will produce very light, pastel greens. More dye will create more vibrant values."

Create a third dish of green icing by mixing in green dye or equal amounts of blue and yellow dyes, following the same procedure used for the other samples. Add a very small amount of black to this third sample. After thoroughly mixing in the black food coloring , you should see a darker shade of the original green. The actual hue should remain the same, though. Since black can have a dramatic impact on the appearance of the color, you should only work with very small amounts of it."

      "content": "Experiment with other combinations. Use the remaining samples of white icing to experiment with different combinations. Record the dye hues and amounts used in each sample for later reference. Use guidelines from the dye manufacturer to create different hues or experiment on your own. Some ideas include: Mix equal parts sky blue and leaf green to create an aqua color. Create chartreuse using nine parts lemon yellow and one part leaf green. Combine equal parts leaf green and royal blue, then add a touch of black. This should create a deep jade color. Mix various amounts of lemon yellow and sky blue to produce a teal or turquoise color."

Similarly, one yellow should be slightly warm (with a hint of orange) and the other should be slightly cool (with a hint of green).

With a palette of primary colors red, blue, and yellow, as well as value colors white and black, Hattas Wilson explains that you can pretty much mix any shade of green your heart desires. “Greens can be slightly redder, where you might add red, or they could be slightly duller, where you might add white or black…so you can play with those 5-7 colors to get many many thousands of shades of green,” she explains. Don’t be afraid to try out color combinations that may seem strange, and keep experimenting until you create the perfect hue. “Art is one of those things that there's not really an answer for. So the nice thing about that is you can always be learning and trying different things. There's not one way to do it,” Hattas Wilson says."
