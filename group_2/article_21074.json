      "content": "Arrange your data in columns. Plotting a line requires data for two different axes. On a line graph, these axes measure change in data over time. For example, if you were measuring distance over time, the x-axis would be time and the y-axis would be distance. Let the leftmost column, column A, represent time, your x-axis. Enter the points in time you want your x-axis to cover in column A. In the next column over, enter the data points for the first line you wish to plot over the time period in column A. Add the data for your next line in the next column over, and repeat this process until all of the data points you want to graph are listed under a column on the spreadsheet. These columns will all appear as lines plotted over time, the x-axis of your graph. [2] X Research source All of the data points for the same line need to be listed in the same column. Label your data categories in row 1. For column A, this label will be the metric of time you will graph your lines over. Label your other columns with the category of data they represent. For example, if you were graphing the sales of different Honda models over the past decade, column A would be labeled \"Year\" and columns B, C, and D could be labeled \"CR-V\", \"Civic\", \"Accord\", and so on. Your lines would then be labeled as CR-V, Civic, and Accord, and plotted over the years you entered in column A."

Add new data to this range by changing the second letter value of the range to the letter of the furthest right column you are adding plotting on your graph. Updating a graph's range of data will automatically plot that data on the graph. If you had graphed lines for columns A through E, and wanted to make lines for data in columns F and G, you would change the second letter in the range to \"G\". If you are adding a new row of data, change the second number value to include the new number row you want to graph. Update your data range to include as many new columns of data as you want. Each column of data you add to the range will be plotted as a separate line."
