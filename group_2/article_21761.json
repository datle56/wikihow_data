      "content": "Decide how you want to arrange the records on the wall. You can hang a single row of records across your wall. Or, it may work better in your space to arrange them in a square or rectangle shape. Either way, the best place to hang your records is nearby—or even above—your record player, to make it easier to slip one out and give it a spin. [1] X Research source Consider the size of your record collection when determining your layout. The arrangement will look best if all the rows have the same number of records."

      "content": "Purchase 4 screw hooks per record. Once you’ve decided how many records you’ll be hanging up, you can calculate how many screw hooks you need. L-shaped screw hooks are sold at most hardware stores. Find ones that are about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. [2] X Research source Screw hooks typically come in both silver and gold finishes. Consider matching the hooks to other metallic accents in your room, like the door handles or light fixtures."

      "title": "Draw a line on the wall where you want the bottom of your records to go.",
      "content": "Draw a line on the wall where you want the bottom of your records to go. Using a spirit level and a pencil, draw a straight line across the wall to mark where the bottom of your records should sit. To tell if the spirit level is positioned correctly, look at the bubble in the tube. It’s straight if the bubble is centered between the two black lines. It’s crooked if the bubble slides off to one side. You can also use a long strip of painters’ tape to mark the line instead of a pencil, if you don’t want to write on the wall. Make sure you use a spirit level with this method, too, to ensure that the tape isn’t crooked."

      "title": "Measure and mark where to screw the bottom hooks for the first record.",
      "content": "Measure and mark where to screw the bottom hooks for the first record. Make two dots 10 inches (25 cm) apart along the straight line you just drew, positioning them in the center of your planned layout. These will hold the center record in the bottom row (or just the center record if you’re only hanging a single row of records). [3] X Research source For each record, you will position two screws along the bottom. The other screws are positioned one on each side, about halfway up the record jacket to keep it from tipping off the wall."

    {
      "title": "Mark the position of the side hook screws.",
      "content": "Mark the position of the side hook screws. Starting from the mark for the right bottom screw, measure 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) horizontally to the right, then 6.5 inches (17 cm) vertically and mark with a dot. This is the location of the right side screw. Then, starting from the mark for the left bottom screw, measure 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) horizontally to the left and 6.5 inches (17 cm) vertically and mark with another dot. This is the location of the left side screw. [4] X Research source The two side screws should end up being 12.5 inches (32 cm) apart horizontally. There are no top screws in this arrangement, which makes it easy to slip your record in and out."

    {
      "title": "Mark the screw holes for the other records in the same row.",
      "content": "Mark the screw holes for the other records in the same row. Use the same spacing for the screws for each individual record. There should be a 1 inch (2.5 cm) space between each record and the one next to it, meaning that the side screws for separate records should also be spaced 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. The left bottom screw for one record should always be 4 inches (10 cm) from the right bottom screw for another."

      "title": "Insert the screws into the wall where you marked.",
      "content": "Insert the screws into the wall where you marked. Once you've marked the location of all the screws, start installing them into the wall. Make a small hole in the drywall with a nail to start the process. Then, use your hand to manually twist the screw into the wall. Make sure the screws stay as straight as possible and are not angled up or down. The screw should stick out about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the wall The “L” part of the bottom screw hooks should point up. The side screws should point inwards towards the record."

      "title": "Slide each record between the side screws so it rests on the bottom hooks.",
      "content": "Slide each record between the side screws so it rests on the bottom hooks. Once all the screws have been attached to the wall, you can slide the records into their slots. You can pull them out whenever you want to play them, or replace them with a new record. Slide the records in gently—it's never a good idea to put additional pressure on the screw hooks, which can be ripped out of the wall."

    {
      "title": "Repeat this process for each additional row in your layout.",
      "content": "Repeat this process for each additional row in your layout. Measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top edge of the records that you’re already displayed on the wall and use a spirit level to draw another straight horizontal line. Use this as the basis for your next set of screw hooks. The screws should line up vertically with the screws in the row below."

Play-and-display frames feature a front that pops open and latches shut for easy access to the records. This is one of the more expensive frame options and is best for a collector who plans to play their displayed records frequently. [5] X Research source Frames may be a better option for displaying a small number of records, since they are typically more expensive than other display options."

      "content": "Go with plain plastic frames for a purely decorative option. These are typically the most economical choice and often come in packs of 10 or 20. However, they make it difficult to access your albums and can occasionally be too thin to hold the sleeve with the record inside of it. [6] X Research source You could display either a record sleeve or the actual LP in one of these square frames. If you plan to display the record itself, don’t use one that you plan to play again, since it will almost certainly get scratched by the frame."

These are a great option for displaying thicker or gatefold albums, since there’s no glass front. [7] X Research source These are also a more economical option."

      "content": "Measure and mark where you want the records to hang. If you’re hanging multiple records, consider using parchment paper to map out their positioning on the wall. A good rule of thumb is to leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) between frames, but you could space them out further. Just make sure they are evenly spaced."

Generally you should to clean and then dry the area wall where you’re applying the tape, but check the instructions on your particular brand of tape to make sure. Pull off the backing on one side and press it firmly to the frame. Then, remove the other backing and press the tape firmly into the wall for several seconds. [8] X Research source Double check that the tape you’ve chosen is strong enough to support the weight of the frame. Most mounting tapes include their weight limit on the packaging. This is a great option if you're renting and don't want to leave permanent marks on the walls."

      "content": "Hang the frame with a nail and wire for a more adjustable option. Hammer a nail into the wall at a slight upwards angle, then slide the frame down over the nail into position. Use a level to adjust the frame to make sure it’s straight. Certain frames, such as those featuring top and bottom rails, may come with drywall mounting screws. Position the frame in place using a level, then use a screwdriver to screw it into the drywall."

You could arrange your records in a single straight line, or go with a square or rectangular configuration. Decide if you want to space the records out with several inches in between, or if you want to line them up so their edges touch. [9] X Research source This display option will scratch up the records, so make sure you’re using records that you don’t plan to play. If you’ve selected records with brightly colored labels, consider laying them out in a rainbow pattern. Or, arrange them so the colors are distributed evenly. If you have enough records, consider lining them up edge to edge so they cover the entire wall—or even the ceiling. [10] X Research source"

Stick the record to the wall, and repeat with the rest of your records to test out the layout you’ve settled on.

Peel off the tape backing and press the record firmly against the wall to attach it permanently. [12] X Research source Repeat with the rest of your records until you’ve completed your layout. You can also use thumbtacks and stick one through the middle of the LP to attach it to the wall. This will leave a hole in your wall, however. [13] X Research source"
