      "content": "Enlist in the Army . You must have a minimum of four years in Service to qualify for Delta Force, so your first step in becoming a Delta Force operative is to enlist in the Army as a regular soldier and work steadily to rise through the ranks. Take and pass the Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) and qualify for security clearance with your recruiter and discuss your ambitions to join Delta Force. All applicants for SFOD-D must be male, at least 22 years old, have a general technical score of 110 or higher. You must attain the rank of E-4 through E-8, with at least four years in service, and have at least two years remaining on your contract to qualify. [2] X Research source To get started on the right foot, talk to your recruiter about your eventual desires to end up in an elite unit like Delta Force, so you'll be advised correctly. For the most part, you'll want to volunteer for a combat arms job, to qualify more quickly for more advanced training and specialization. For the most part, Delta Force soldiers are Green Berets or Rangers first, then are recruited out of their specialization. Make joining the special forces your first goal."

      "content": "Attend Airborne Training at Fort Benning. Special Forces troopers who eventually want to join Delta Force must qualify for and complete airborne training, in addition to AIT and other specialized training. This is a voluntary training that some soldiers elect to take to \"earn their wings,\" becoming paratroopers. It's four weeks of jump training, starting on the ground and eventually moving to completing a series of jumps at an altitude of 1,200 feet (365.8 m)."

      "content": "Attend a Special Operations Preparation Course (SOPC). These four-week courses typically lead up to the Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) program, which you must pass to be admitted to Special Forces training and continue your rising in the ranks. The SFAS program assesses and selects Soldiers for attendance at the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC). This program allows Special Forces an opportunity to assess each Soldier's capabilities by testing his physical, emotional, and mental stamina. Once you pass the SFAS, you'll move on to the SFQC. The SFQC teaches and develops the skills necessary for Special Forces. The enlisted applicant's SFQC training will be scheduled upon successful completion of SFAS."

Training for this phase is 65 days and culminates with a mission planning cycle, during which you'll put your leadership skills to the test, as well as hone your particular specialities and skills that you've been developing over the course of your training. Different soldiers, depending on their experience, training, and specialities, will have different responsibilities during MOS. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make it clear what you want. The military respects ambition and rewards skill and dedication. If you want to join Delta Force, make it clear to your commanding officers and other ranking officials. This is the best way to be recruited to train and possibly qualify for part of this elite unit. If you leave your desire a secret, it's unlikely you'll be tasked with joining up. Be honest about what you want. Get to know your COs and other ranking officers very well. It's no understatement to say, like anything else, there's a political element to getting promoted and getting what you want in the military. Make friends in high places and you'll have someone's ear, and also have a good line into what other COs and ranking officers expect from the soldiers. Keep an ear out for tips and tricks. Talk to the right people."

Focus on giving every task that you are faced with 110 percent effort and never ever quit. You are not expected to be a super-soldier right off the starting line, but you are expected to be considerably above average and to remain committed to improving your skills and being a teachable soldier. [4] X Research source Remember, once you're admitted, you'll be trained extensively, and put to the test mentally and physically. You just have to get there. If anyone asks if you're ready, your only answer should be \"Yes, sir.\""

      "title": "Get in your peak physical condition.",
      "content": "Get in your peak physical condition. Delta Force soldiers need to be beyond fit. Even if you haven't enlisted as an infantry soldier yet, it's a good idea to start getting into your peak physical condition, focusing specifically on building endurance and cardiovascular strength. Practice walking for very long distances (30mi or more) with a weighted (60lbs) rucksack. Try for 15 minute miles, though you will be expected to travel at a much faster pace during Selection. To complement your endurance training, include exercises like squats, which are excellent for overall lower body strength and stability, critical for handling the physical demands of ruck marching. You can perform squats using body weight, dumbbells, or a barbell, progressively increasing resistance to build strength. Additionally, core-strengthening exercises like planks can improve your stability and balance during long treks. Start with a 30-second plank and gradually increase the duration to track your progress."

Know how to use a compass and map intimately, practicing your skills as often as possible. If you've already got that down, it's one less thing you'll have to focus on learning during training, so you can focus on improving other aspects of your candidacy."
