      "title": "Combine the ingredients in a large mixing bowl.",
      "content": "Combine the ingredients in a large mixing bowl. First, add five tablespoons of all-purpose bleached flour. You can also include other types of flour – almond flour, buckwheat flour, whole-wheat flour, etc. Mix these other flour types in with the all-purpose flour, if you like, but be aware that every type of flour has its own moisture content and baking properties. Changing the flour may alter the recipe. [1] X Research source Use chemically-treated \"bleached\" flour, if possible. Bleached flour contains less protein than unbleached flour, and it is better for quick breads. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix in a teaspoon each of baking powder and vanilla.",
      "content": "Mix in a teaspoon each of baking powder and vanilla. The baking powder will make the bread \"rise\" by increasing its volume. Don't add too much, or else the dough may rise out of control! The vanilla is optional: it won't impact the baking process and it can give the bread a pleasantly sweet taste."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add one egg.",
      "content": "Add one egg. Break an egg and stir it thoroughly into the mixture. The egg size does not matter, although a larger egg will make a somewhat moister bread. Be careful not to leave any eggshell shards in the dough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 2-3 tablespoons of milk.",
      "content": "Add 2-3 tablespoons of milk. You can use any milk that you prefer: cow milk, almond milk, rice milk, coconut milk, hemp milk. A thicker milk will make for a slightly richer bread. The main function of the milk, however, is to moisten the dough so that the flour sticks together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 2 tablespoons of water.",
      "content": "Add 2 tablespoons of water. Again, this functions to moisten the dough so that the flour sticks. If you don't use water, your bread will be much too dry. Mix the water into the bowl with everything else."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 2-3 tablespoons of oil.",
      "content": "Add 2-3 tablespoons of oil. You can use olive oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, coconut oil – anything that you prefer to bake with. The main function of the oil is to thicken the dough and moisten the bread, so you may find that taste is the biggest difference between oils."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the dough.",
      "content": "Knead the dough. Use clean hands to mix the dough more thoroughly and stabilize the consistency. Massage the batter firmly, and try to mix the moisture evenly through. Knead the dough for 2-5 minutes, or until you can stretch it apart without it disintegrating."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shape the dough.",
      "content": "Shape the dough. Use clean hands to gently shape the dough into a ball or an ovular shape. This is the shape that the final loaf will take, so consider whether you need your bread to take any particular form. Score the top of the loaf with an X so that it doesn't crack while rising."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the dough onto a microwave-safe dish.",
      "content": "Place the dough onto a microwave-safe dish. Most ceramic and glass containers are safe – but you should not microwave metal under any circumstances. Many microwave-safe containers are labeled as such. Make sure that the dish is shallow, with a flat bottom: you will need to get the bread out afterward. [3] X Research source Try using a large ceramic mug. This container is microwave-safe, ideally sized, and easy to remove without scalding yourself. This is best for single servings."

    {
      "title": "Microwave for 5 minutes on a high heat.",
      "content": "Microwave for 5 minutes on a high heat. When you remove the bread, it should be ready to eat. If your microwave has a window, check in on the dough periodically to make sure that it isn't overcooked or rising out of control. If the dough starts to look dry, flaky, or shriveled, you might have heated all of the moisture out of it! Slice and serve your bread."
