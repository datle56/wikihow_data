      "content": "Refrigerate as many of the juices and other blends as you can. Depending on how long you have before your party, try to refrigerate the juices, fruit punch, pink lemonade, and rum for as long as you can before mixing everything together. If your fridge won’t fit everything, just get as much in there as you can. [1] X Research source Chilling the ingredients beforehand is really helpful so that you won’t have to use as much ice. Ice would dilute your drink and take up more room in the punch bowl."

      "content": "Put the vodka in the freezer to chill it before the party. Vodka won’t freeze solid no matter how long it’s in the freezer for, so it’s a great way to get it really cold before you have to add it to the punch. Even if you won’t be making the punch for a few days, it’s okay to leave it in there. [2] X Research source Don’t put the rum or the other liquids into the freezer, though. They might freeze solid or break open, which could make things really difficult when it comes time to mix the punch. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean out containers that will be large enough to hold all the liquid. Punch bowls are great, as are those large drink dispensers that let people pour their own drinks. If you don’t have any of these available, find the largest glass or plastic bowls that you can, or grab a few pitchers and make do with what you have. Rinse them out or wipe them down ahead of time to clear away any dust that may have accumulated since the last time you used them. [4] X Research source If you’re concerned about the drink being cool enough, you could always place the punch bowls on top of ice to help keep things chilled. That way the drink itself won’t get diluted."

      "title": "Pour all of the liquids into the serving bowl, dividing equally if needed.",
      "content": "Pour all of the liquids into the serving bowl, dividing equally if needed. This recipe makes about 2.5 gallons (9,500 mL) of jungle juice. If your punch bowl isn’t large enough for that entire amount, split the liquids out evenly between however many containers you’ll need to use. Measure out 1 gallon (3,800 mL) of orange-flavored drink, 46 fluid ounces (1,400 mL) of fruit punch, 2 US quarts (1,900 mL) of pink lemonade, 2 US quarts (1,900 mL) of a pineapple and orange juice blend, 2 750 mL (25 fl oz) bottles of vodka, and 1 750 mL (25 fl oz) bottle of white rum. [5] X Research source A great thing about jungle juice is that you can swap out ingredients for whatever you like the best. If you prefer cranberry juice or mango juice, use that instead! If you want lime-lemonade, switch it out. Whatever you do, the drink will be fruity and boozy."

      "content": "Stir all the ingredients together until they are fully combined. Use a long wooden spoon to gently stir everything together. It shouldn’t take long, which makes this a nice, easy recipe to pull together quickly before a party starts. [6] X Research source If you want, you could even add in some fresh fruit to the serving bowls. Sliced strawberries, diced apples , and fresh citrus are great options that complement the fruity vibe of the drink. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Enjoy the jungle juice and drink responsibly! Ladle the juice into cups for your friends to enjoy (or just let them serve themselves). Add ice to individual cups when needed, and have a good time celebrating. Make sure to drink safely, stay hydrated, and stay off the road if you’ve over-imbibed. There probably won’t be any jungle juice leftover, but if there is, put it into an airtight container and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Give the mixture a quick stir before you drink it again, just in case any of the juices have settled to the bottom."

This recipe makes 2 gallons (7,600 mL), so plan accordingly for how many containers you’ll need for all of the liquid. If you don’t have punch bowls or a drink dispenser, you could use juice pitchers or even just large glass or plastic mixing bowls.

The slices will go into the punch bowl later to marinate with the liquids, plus they make a really pretty presentation. Feel free to add more citrus if you feel like it! There is no right or wrong amount for jungle juice. You could also use grapefruit , blood oranges, or limes , just depending on what you have available."

Pour things carefully so that they don’t splash and stain your clothes. [9] X Research source If you are making this punch ahead of time, don’t add the sparkling wine just yet. You want to add it right before the party so that the bubbles are still popping. You can use either fresh or bottled lime juice, just depending on what you prefer and have available."

If you don’t think the drink needs any extra sugar, you can omit this part of the recipe. The brown sugar just helps to make the drink a little sweeter and mask the flavor of the alcohol a little more. The juice and fruit have sugar in them already, so use your own discretion."

Check the bottom of the bowl to make sure all the brown sugar has dissolved. If the liquid is reaching the top of the container at this point, you may want to divide it between two (or more) containers. You still need to add the sliced fruit, which will add a lot more volume to the jungle juice."

Give the juice a quick stir to disperse the fruit so it’s not sticking together. If you want, let the punch sit in the fridge for a few hours so that the fruit has time to soak up the juice. Remember, if you want to do this, wait to add the sparkling wine until just before it’s ready to serve."

If you’re using pitchers or a drink dispenser, your guests can just help themselves and add ice if they want it. Enjoy your time celebrating with friends, and remember to drink responsibly! [10] X Research source Avoid adding ice directly to the punch. It’s better to serve it over top of ice when you pour it into glasses, otherwise, the ice might dilute the drink."
