Technically, it can be on an old receipt if that’s what you have. However, putting it on nice stationary or a special note card is a thoughtful touch. Or try getting a little creative with one of these ideas: Sticky notes come in all different sizes and colors. And you can stick them anywhere! Write your note out on a napkin or paper towel and put it in her lunch bag. That way, she’ll have a nice surprise at lunch time. Write it out on a postcard and send it to her through snail mail. It might take a day or so, but getting a sweet note is way better than bills or junk mail! If she’s a reader, get a paper bookmark and write your note on the back.

Then, use that as inspiration for your note. “Describe the qualities that make them special to you… the qualities that actually touch your heart… It can even be quirky, cute things about them,” explains Beck. Another option is to make a list of your feelings and let that be in your note. Elizabeth Barrett Browning took this approach and created one of the most famous love poems of all time."

Think about what your life was like before you met her and how it’s different now. Do you laugh and smile more? Are you happier than you’ve ever been? Are you inspired to try new things? Tell her about it! According to Beck, it’s a good idea to “share one of your favorite memories with them. Or maybe a very simple moment that really touched your heart, but you never told them.” One example would be to say something like, “One day when we were eating ice cream, you didn’t notice you got some on your nose. I just knew. You’re the one for me.”"

That’s a perfectly acceptable approach that won’t take away from the feelings you share. However, leaving the note somewhere for her to find gives her a delightful surprise as she goes about her day. Think about her routine and place the note where she’s sure to see it. Put the note on her bathroom mirror where she’ll see it first thing in the morning. If you have a set of keys to her car, place it on her seat where she’ll find it when she goes to work."
