      "content": "This means you’ve made an impression on her. Pisces women are daydreamers, with an imagination so vivid that they don’t always notice the people right in front of them. If she’s looking at you (and not anywhere else), then it may mean you’ve captured her attention even better than those daydreams! [1] X Research source Mutual eye contact also indicates romantic interest. Try making eye contact with her and see what happens; if she holds your gaze, then she probably likes you.

      "content": "A Pisces woman might need her crush to make the first move. This is not because she’s flighty or uninterested, though. When a Pisces woman falls for someone, she falls hard! To counterbalance that she might try to protect herself—which translates as shyness. If she seems reserved or nervous, she might just be coming to terms with the fact that she does like you. [3] X Research source Does she fiddle with her clothing or jewelry? Blush when you make eye contact? Has she ever stammered or lost her train of thought when you’re talking? These common signs of shyness also imply that she likes you. [4] X Research source Don’t worry: her initial hesitation will soon turn into warmth and eagerness if she likes you. All you need to do is take the first step, and she’ll begin to open up from there!"

      "content": "Does she pay attention to you, and remember details about your life? Once a Pisces woman gets a crush, she wants to connect emotionally with the object of her affection. [5] X Research source So, she’ll try and learn every detail about you that she can: your hobbies, goals, favorite foods, birthday, and everything in between. Open-ended questions (which require more than a “yes” or “no” to answer) allow people to get to know one another on a deeper level. She’ll likely ask you lots of them if she’s trying to connect with you. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pisces women are intuitive and quickly realize when they like someone. When she’s crushing on you, she’ll want to be involved in your life and have as much quality time with you as she can. She also won’t think twice or hesitate before saying “yes” if you ask her to hang out. If she’s making time for you in her schedule, then she likes you—and she’s well aware of it. [7] X Research source Pisces women are also known to be evasive when they’re not sure about someone; they have trouble saying “no,” as they don’t like other people to be upset. If you do sense hesitation when you ask her to spend time with you, talk to her about it before jumping to conclusions. There could be other factors besides a lack of interest at play!"

      "content": "Does she ask where you are, if you’re okay, or if you need anything? Pisces women naturally tend to worry about people they like, and because they have such a strong imagination, it’s easy for them to take that worry a little too far. [12] X Research source If she checks in with you often and seems to feel better as soon as she hears from you, this is a big sign that she has feelings for you. For some people, this behavior can come off as controlling. However, that isn’t her intention, and she’ll appreciate any sort of quick reassurance that all is well!"

Pisces are intelligent people, but often turn that brainpower toward more philosophical ideas rather than recalling directions or researching the best place to grab dinner. When she asks you for help, she’s telling you that she values your opinion and wants you to be someone that she can rely on for guidance. [13] X Research source Giving advice can go a long way towards building a relationship with someone. Offer thoughtful guidance when she comes to you with a problem, and she’ll appreciate you all the more for it! [14] X Research source"

Keep in mind that your Pisces will still probably be the more easygoing one in the relationship overall, but over time she’ll start to put forward her own ideas for spending time together. When she’s truly invested in the relationship, she’ll put a lot of effort into coming up with activities she knows you’ll enjoy. [17] X Research source Be patient if she doesn't do this right away; Piscean women are often more timid at the beginning of a relationship but find their footing later (once they know that you’re as committed as they are)."
