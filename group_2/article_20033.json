      "content": "Odor neutralizers remove the smell deep inside your vehicle’s vents. Turn your vehicle on and set your fans high with the windows closed. Press the button on the odor neutralizer spray to activate it and close the door. Let the spray circulate inside your car for 15 minutes before taking it out. When you’re finished, roll down your windows and let your vehicle air out for another 15 minutes. [1] X Research source An odor neutralizer spray has chemicals that purify the air, so they’re the most effective ways to get the weed smell out of a rental car before returning it or your vehicle after hotboxing it. Odor neutralizers contain chemicals that cause eye and skin irritation, so wait to sit in or drive your vehicle until it airs out."

      "content": "The weed smell will dissipate when you roll your windows down. Right after a hotbox or smoke session, crack your windows so the smoke can escape without getting trapped inside. When you’re driving your vehicle, roll the windows down and turn your fans on full blast to let fresh air cycle through. [2] X Research source If you keep your vehicle in a garage, leave your windows rolled down or doors open overnight to let it air out."

      "title": "Air fresheners work well to quickly hide the odor.",
      "content": "Air fresheners work well to quickly hide the odor. Spray an air freshener spray inside your vehicle and run your fans to help it circulate throughout the interior. You can also hang up an air freshener from your rear-view mirror or clip one onto your vents to cover up the scent even more. Air fresheners usually only hide weed odors for a few hours, but they might be noticeable as the freshener fades away."

      "title": "A diffuser masks the scent whenever you run your fan.",
      "content": "A diffuser masks the scent whenever you run your fan. Get an essential oil diffuser for your car that easily clips onto your vent. Fill the diffuser with your favorite essential oil and let it run in your vehicle whenever you’re driving. While it may not completely eliminate the source of the odor, it will help circulate a fresh scent so you’re less likely to smell weed. [3] X Research source You can also get an electronic diffuser that fits into your vehicle’s cup holder and plugs into a USB port."

      "content": "Baking soda works to remove weed smells from your vehicle’s upholstery. You can sprinkle the baking soda directly on your carpets and upholstery. Let the baking soda sit for at least 2 hours to deodorize your car , but you can leave it overnight if your car has a really strong odor. When you’re finished, just vacuum up the baking soda and your car will smell fresh again. [4] X Research source If you can still detect a weed smell, try sprinkling more baking soda in your vehicle to absorb the residual odors."

      "title": "Weed odors get trapped in the pores of activated charcoal.",
      "content": "Weed odors get trapped in the pores of activated charcoal. Leave an activated charcoal bag or two inside your vehicle on the floor or under your seats if you want to be discreet. Since activated charcoal is really porous, the lingering weed odors in your car will get sucked up into the bag and make your vehicle odor-free over the next 1–2 days. Avoid leaving loose activated charcoal on your vehicle’s upholstery since it could leave a stain. Alternatively, you can try leaving a tin of dry coffee grounds in your car. The grounds absorb odors, but they also mask the weed smell with the scent of fresh coffee."

      "title": "A vinegar solution can help mask and clean lingering odors.",
      "content": "A vinegar solution can help mask and clean lingering odors. Mix equal parts of water and white vinegar in a bowl. Dip a soft microfiber cleaning rag in the solution and wring it out before wiping the surfaces of your vehicle, like the dashboard, steering wheel, and doors. The vinegar smell hides the weed smell, and it also has the added benefit of cleaning up any dirt and dust. [5] X Research source Alternatively, try leaving a shallow glass or bowl filled with white vinegar in your vehicle for a day or two to eliminate the odor. Just be sure to take it out when you’re driving so you don’t spill."

      "content": "Detailing the inside of your vehicle leaves it smelling fresh and clean. Start off by cleaning the inside of your vehicle with upholstery shampoo to lift up any odors that are stuck in your seats and carpet. Make sure you wipe or vacuum up dust or ash you see as well to remove the smoky smell. Finish up by wiping down the windows with a glass cleaner with a fresh scent to make your vehicle odor-free. [6] X Research source If you used the ashtray in your vehicle, be sure to vacuum out the ashes and wipe it down with your cleaner. It may take a few cleanings to completely remove the weed odors from your vehicle."

      "content": "Weed odors might get caught in the old filter and circulate smelly air. If you still smell weed whenever you run your AC, then the air filter is probably the culprit. You can usually find your air filter behind your glove compartment or under your hood, but check your vehicle’s manual to know where it is for sure. Pull out the old filter and slide a replacement filter made for your vehicle into the slot. [7] X Research source When you take out your filter, clean your vents with a commercial vent cleaner spray just in case there are odors deep inside the system."
