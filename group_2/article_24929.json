      "content": "Contact your service provider. Telephone companies allow the transfer of telephone lines from one place to another. What's going to happen is that they'll just transfer your existing line to the area where you're moving to instead of creating a new telephone line. On the other hand, not all landlines can be transferred for these reasons: The area you want your landline to be transferred is not covered by your telephone company. The telephone company may not have any existing service for the area where you want your phone to be transferred. The place you're moving to is simply far away. Having your service transferred to a different state is just not that ideal."

      "content": "Request for a transfer of line. The customer service will inform you if your telephone can be transferred. If it's possible, you can start to request a transfer of line. Just state the place where you want to move your existing service to and fill up some documents that may be required by your telephone company."

This may take a few days or weeks depending on where you want your line to be moved to and if there are any available slots in the systems where your service can be squeezed in. Also, standard fees such as installation and relocation fees may apply depending on your service provider."

Requesting a new SIM card with the same number can either be free or may come with a little fee, depending on the service you're using."

      "title": "Contact your carrier's customer support and ask for your PAC.",
      "content": "Contact your carrier's customer support and ask for your PAC. A PAC, or Porting Authorization Code, is a unique alphanumeric code that is used to transfer an existing cellphone number between mobile network carriers. This way, a user can still retain his or her mobile number even after switching to a different service provider. Different countries have different guidelines regarding the issuing of PACs to subscribers. All you need to do is to contact your service provider and ask for your Portability Authorization Code. If you meet your respective country's guidelines on PAC, the service provider should readily issue one for you. You can get your Porting Authorization Code either for free or with a fee, depending on your network carrier's policies."
