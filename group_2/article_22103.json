Men who smoke and drink heavily are more likely to have low sperm count. If you're having a hard time quitting, talk to your doctor. Don't take illegal drugs, as they can slow sperm production.

During this time, conceiving a boy is more likely. It’s thought that there are higher levels of hormones that favor female sperm during peak fertility, which would explain why humans are slightly more likely to have girl in the first place.

You can also use an ovulation kit . This is the cornerstone of the Babydust method. Per the Babydust method, your luteinizing hormones are highest in the days before ovulation. These hormones are thought to be the main factor in whether you have a boy or not. [6] X Research source"

It’s based on the idea that the male sperm are distinct from female sperm in terms of their shape and speed, and that by changing the way you have sex you can improve the pH of the vagina to give male sperm an advantage. It’s been mostly disproven over the years, but some couples swear by its efficacy. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Here’s how it works: Have sex as close to ovulation as possible. Have deep, penetrative sex and have the man thrust as deeply inside of the vagina as possible at the moment of ejaculation. Having sex in the doggy style or reverse cowgirl position may help. Increase the alkalinity of your vagina by keeping your vagina clean , eating plenty of garlic, and taking probiotics if your doctor thinks it’s appropriate. Have the woman orgasm before the man."

The Ericsson method, also known as the MicroSort method, is the only medically-recognized option outside of IVF when it comes to sex selection from sperm. [13] X Research source Sperm separation may not be as consistent as IVF, but it’s a lot cheaper and a lot less invasive. [14] X Research source Sperm separation works by spinning sperm at a high speed through a fluid and light filter. In theory, this should split up the male and female sperm.

If the clinic agrees to perform this procedure, the female partner will probably need to begin preparing to donate eggs several weeks to a month in advance. Generally, women undergoing PGD and IVF are given fertility drugs to stimulate the ovaries to release more mature eggs. [21] X Research source Usually, fertility drugs are taken for about two weeks via pill or injection. [22] X Research source Side effects for common fertility drugs are usually mild and can include hot flashes, nausea, bloating, headache, and blurred vision. Some IVF clinics in the United States will not agree to sort for gender unless the parents have a specific reason (they want a girl and have 3 boys, women in the family history have genetic diseases, etc.)."

It's often necessary for perfectly healthy couples to have to undergo multiple rounds of PGD and IVF to achieve their desired pregnancy. If you've failed a cycle, ask your doctor why they think the transfer didn't work, what they would want to change next time, and if there's anything you can do to increase your chances of success.
