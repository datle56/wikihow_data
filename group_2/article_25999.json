      "title": "Check the pilot light.",
      "content": "Check the pilot light. You will probably need to remove a small panel, called an access panel, at the bottom of the tank in order to see whether the pilot light is actually out. If you do not see a small flame burning, then your pilot light has gone out. If you have a newer water heater, it is possible that your panel is not removable and that you view your pilot light through glass. In this case, if you cannot see a flame burning through the glass, then your pilot light is out."

      "title": "Make sure there is no leaking gas.",
      "content": "Make sure there is no leaking gas. You should never try to reignite your pilot if there is gas leaking from your water heater, as this is extremely dangerous to both you and your home. Before attempting to relight the pilot, do a simple smell test to check for leakage. Stand next to your water heater and see if you detect any unusual smells. Then kneel down and sniff near any valves on the front and side of the tank. Natural gas is odorless by nature, but gas companies add a substance called mercaptan to it to make it detectable to humans. Leaking gas smells like sulfur or rotten eggs. If you smell gas in either of these places (even a faint smell), do not attempt to relight the pilot. Leave the area of the water heater and call your gas company immediately; they will tell you how to proceed. Also listen for a hissing sound near the water heater, as this is a sign of a gas leak."

      "content": "Set the temperature control setting to the lowest temperature. This is typically located on the front of a box found on the outside of the water heater."

      "title": "Locate the regulator valve.",
      "content": "Locate the regulator valve. This valve is usually located on the same box as the temperature control, only it’s likely on top of the box; it regulates gas flow to the pilot burner beneath the hot water tank. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine what style of water heater you have.",
      "content": "Determine what style of water heater you have. There are two basic styles of gas hot water heaters, “new” and “old.” Old style heaters will require you to use your own flame to relight the pilot, while new style tanks come equipped with a pilot light igniter. [3] X Research source The exact look of the buttons on new style tanks may vary, but many have a red igniter button set a few inches away from the temperature and regulator valves."

    {
      "title": "Collect any necessary lighting materials.",
      "content": "Collect any necessary lighting materials. If you have an old style water heater, you will need to find a long reach “wand” lighter or fireplace matches to relight the pilot. Do not attempt to relight a pilot with a regular matchstick or a small cigarette lighter, as this will require placing your fingers in a small, tight space too close to the open flame and put you in danger of getting burned."

      "content": "Turn the gas valve to the \"Pilot\" setting and push down on it. Doing this starts the flow of gas into the tube that supplies the pilot light. If your water heater’s gas valve does not push down, look for a red control button near the valve. Hold this button down."

    {
      "title": "Light the pilot burner.",
      "content": "Light the pilot burner. While holding down the pilot gas valve or the red button with one hand, you will use your other hand to quickly light the pilot. If you have a new style water tank with a built-in ignition switch, press this button. You should hear a clicking noise until the pilot burner lights. [4] X Research source If you have an old style heater, apply your wand lighter/match to the pilot burner. Because you will be using one hand to depress the valve/red button and one hand to light the pilot, you may need someone to hold a flashlight for you if extra light is needed. Try to ask someone for help in advance so that you don’t get halfway through the process, then have to stop because you are unable to see what you’re doing."

      "content": "Continue holding down the gas valve or control button for 1 minute after the pilot light has been lit. This will heat the thermocouple, which is a sensor that shuts the gas off when the pilot is out.
