      "content": "Choose interconnected chair raisers if you want stability. Although you can purchase individual chair raisers, interconnected designs tend to rock less. Interconnected chair raisers fit to the chair via highly adjustable raiser legs, which move in and out as well as to the side. [1] X Research source If you chose an interconnected chair raiser, you will only need 1 instead of 4. Interconnected chair raisers generally cost more than other raisers."

      "content": "Pick a height for your chair raisers. Chair raisers usually come in sizes from about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 5 inches (13 cm). Decide how much higher you want your chairs to be and pick a chair raiser that comes in your desired height. [2] X Research source If you want you dining chairs to better fit a table's height, subtract the idea height of your chair from its current height to determine the right size for your raisers. Raisers are often one size fits most, but you may want to check the base's dimensions to make sure they're not too small for your chair legs."

      "content": "Fit the chair's legs into the raisers. Chair raisers, both single and interconnected, have indentations for the chair leg to fit inside. Lift the chair and place the leg into the indentation, repeating this process for each of the chair's legs. [3] X Research source To ensure safety, all 4 of your chair's legs should have a raiser, unless you're using an interconnected raiser. Ask another person for help lifting the chair if fitting the raisers is beyond your physical capacity."

      "content": "Paint the raiser to match your chair's color. To give your chair raiser a stylish, low-profile finish, paint it the color of your chair. Apply 2-3 coats of paint, then seal it with a finish to prevent the color from chipping over time. Although you may not be able to find an exact color match, painting can help your chair raisers stand out less. Chair raisers often come in a variety of colors and finishes. Look for raisers that are the same color and made from the same material as your chair online or at a home improvement store."

      "content": "Use wood blocks to match wooden chair legs. Wood blocks specifically designed for raising furniture can be an inexpensive way to increase a dining chair's height. Place a wood block under all of the chair's legs, and paint or stain your wood blocks to help them match the chair's color. Unlike chair raisers, wood blocks generally do not have holes for the . They are safe but less secure than raisers for this reason. You can get chair raisers online or at many home improvement stores in a variety of heights and finishes. Choose a block height that matches how much taller you want the chair to be."

      "content": "Try casters if you want a rolling option for hard floors. Casters are detachable wheels that lift your dining chair's height and make it more portable. Attaching the casters is different for each brand but usually involves drilling holes in the chair's leg bottoms and screwing the caster in place. Casters are more noticeable than other chair lifting options."

If you only need to raise the height 5 inches (13 cm) or lower, buy a dining chair cushion and tie it to your seat.

      "content": "Replace screw-in chair legs with taller ones. Because most chair legs screw into the body of the chair, you can also buy replacement screw-in legs that are taller than the original legs. Unscrewing old legs and screwing in new legs may be the easiest option for beginners. You can buy replacement screw-in legs at hardware stores or order them online. Be sure you buy 4 identical replacement legs for each chair. If you are an experienced woodworker, you can also replace the legs yourself. Replacing chair legs is not for amateur woodworkers, however, to ensure that the new chair legs are even and safe."

Your carpenter can make legs for your chair that look like the old ones but are long enough to raise its height.

      "content": "Make sure you've adjusted the chair legs to a comfortable height. Individuals that use the chair should be able to sit and stand easily. As a guideline, their feet should lie flat on the ground or footrest while sitting down. Compare these measurements to how the person who sits in this chair most looks while sitting in it. Adjust higher or lower as needed. If many people use this chair, choose the average height as a guideline. Chairs that are too high can cause poor blood circulation, put strain on your knees, and constrict the nerves in your legs. [9] X Research source"
