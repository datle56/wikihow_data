      "title": "Hang diplomas on the wall about 57 in (140 cm) up from the floor.",
      "content": "Hang diplomas on the wall about 57 in (140 cm) up from the floor. Try holding up your diploma at different spots around your home or office until you find the wall space you like the best. If you have someone who can help you, have them hold the diploma against the wall while you stand back and look at it. [1] X Research source If you want to hang multiple degrees vertically, hang the middle one at 57 in (140 cm) up from the floor."

      "title": "Hang your diplomas in order of importance from left to right.",
      "content": "Hang your diplomas in order of importance from left to right. If you'd like to feature your most treasured diplomas, try hanging them from left to right; for example, your Bachelor's degree on the left, your Master's degree in the middle, and your Doctorate on the right. [2] X Research source Or consider a few other orders: Hang the diplomas vertically, with the most important one on top. If you have 4 diplomas, consider hanging them in a square pattern. If you have multiple diplomas and limited space, just hang the most significant one—your PhD, for instance."

      "title": "Choose a wall that's visible to guests, if you're in an office.",
      "content": "Choose a wall that's visible to guests, if you're in an office. If you're hanging your diploma in a space where you talk to customers or guests, consider hanging your diploma behind your desk. That way, when people sit down and talk to you, they will see your diplomas hanging behind you. Placing your diplomas in a highly visible area may help you appear more credible in a business setting. Make sure the wall you choose has very little glare so guests will be able to see details on the diploma."

      "title": "Make a small pencil mark on the wall above the frame.",
      "content": "Make a small pencil mark on the wall above the frame. Once you've found a spot you like, use a pencil to mark the wall over the frame of the diploma. It doesn't need to be a large mark: just large enough for you to see it later, when you're hanging your diploma. [3] X Research source Don't forget to erase the pencil mark if it's still visible after you hang your diploma."

      "title": "Hammer a 1.5–2 in (3.8–5.1 cm) nail into the wall just below the mark.",
      "content": "Hammer a 1.5–2 in (3.8–5.1 cm) nail into the wall just below the mark. Using a hammer, drive a nail through the wall at a 45 degree angle until it is almost—but not completely—flush with the wall. This is the most secure angle for hanging framed items against a vertical flat surface. [4] X Research source Avoid using thumbtacks or other flimsy hangers. A nail is the most secure option."

    {
      "title": "Balance the frame's hanging mechanism on the nail.",
      "content": "Balance the frame's hanging mechanism on the nail. The back of your diploma's frame will have either a wire or a saw-tooth hanger on its top. Rest the hanging mechanism on the top of the nail and adjust the diploma until it looks level. [5] X Research source If your diploma has a wire hanger, rest the middle of the wire onto the nail and let the diploma dangle down. If your diploma has a saw-tooth hanger, place the middle of the saw-tooth hanger onto the nail and lightly let it go. It should stay in place."

      "title": "Use a level to make sure the diploma is straight.",
      "content": "Use a level to make sure the diploma is straight. Take a level and rest it on the top of your diploma's frame. The small bubble in the middle of the level's fluid should come to rest directly in the middle of the level. If it doesn't, adjust the diploma until the bubble is directly in the center. [6] X Research source Hanging a diploma crookedly or sloppily in an office setting may make it seem less credible to others. Although you can use a laser level if you have one, a regular construction level will work perfectly fine. [7] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."
