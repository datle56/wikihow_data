In the United States and Canada, that is 18; in South Korea, Japan, and much of Europe, that is 16. If you want to send and receive gifts while you're Live, you'll need to be at least 18 years old. If you don’t have at least 1,000 followers or are under the age of majority, you will not see the Live feature within your account. [1] X Research source If you are at least 16 years old but don't have 1,000 followers, you can send a support ticket to TikTok to request the Live feature. While this won't guarantee you'll be able to go Live, it will increase your chances."
