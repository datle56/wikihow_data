Use a large framing square if you have one or use a square piece of cardboard. Measure the width of the opening in three places, because if a doorjamb is bowed, the width will be less in the center. [1] X Research source Measure the height of the opening at both sides of the doorway. If they are not the same, check if the floor is level. If the floor is higher at one side, the door should be cut to have this angle at the bottom. [2] X Research source"

Almost all are 80\" (203\" high, so the door may have to be cut at the bottom. The door should be only slightly narrower, (about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm), than the finished opening. If the width of the door you buy is slightly too wide you can cut it to fit. ."

If a gap is too narrow the door may not close in hot, humid weather because it will expand. Allow for a gap of 3 ⁄ 8 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (9.5 to 12.7 mm) under the door. If the floor is not level, cut the door at an angle to allow for gap that is the same on both sides. Allow for a larger gap at the bottom if the door swings out over a carpet."

It is better to trim too little than too much. [3] X Research source If you’re replacing an old door, you can lay the old door on top of the new door and trace around it to easily mark where your cuts will be. If you must take off more than about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) of the door, use a circular saw. For smaller amounts, use a plane or a belt sander."

Hold the hinges on the door's edge to trace around them to mark the locations of the recesses. Before marking the locations, determine the direction that the door will open. The recesses will be narrower than the door's width, but how much narrower depends on the width of the hinges. The door should open into the room, and you must be able to reach the light switch when entering, that is, the door knob side should be the side with the light switch. Hold one hinge 7 inches (18 cm) from the top of the door and trace around it with a sharp pencil. Hold the other hinge 11 inches (28 cm) from the bottom of the door and trace around it.

Remove the hinges and use a drill bit that is slightly thinner than the screws to drill pilot holes where they are marked by the pencil. To center the pilot holes perfectly, you could use a special bit called a Vix-Bit, available at many hardware stores and home centers. To center the holes perfectly you could also mount each hinge with one screw and then drill the other 2 pilot holes."

If the door does not completely close, the hinges may be mounted at a very slight angle. To correct this, loosen the screws that mount the door to the frame. Slip in a thin strip of cardboard to change the angle, then tighten the screws. You may have to make it thicker by using 2 or 3 thin strips."
