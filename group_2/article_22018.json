      "title": "Pass notes.",
      "content": "Pass notes. If you're bored during detention, sometimes socializing can be fun. However, talking is often not allowed when you're being punished. Therefore, passing notes can be a great way to socialize without getting in more trouble. There are many stealthy ways to pass notes in class. You can write notes on small pieces of paper. Slide them to a classmate. You can also fold up a piece of paper until it's very small and then \"accidentally\" drop it near a classmate while going to, say, sharpen your pencil. Watch what you write. In the event your note is found, you do not want to write anything that could get you into more trouble. Avoid writing down the names of teachers or classmates. Do not include your own name anywhere on the note."

      "title": "Draw or write in a notebook.",
      "content": "Draw or write in a notebook. Most schools will allow you to have a small notebook on your desk during detention. You can use the notebook to pass the time. Draw or write when you get bored. Just start writing. Let your thoughts pour onto the page. Try starting with, \"I'm bored\" and go from there. You may find a lot of new and interesting ideas spilling out when you release your thoughts without filter. [1] X Research source If you're a creative type, try to write a story. Look around the room and find three things and try to incorporate all of them into a short story. For example, write a story that includes an eraser, a lunchbox, and a boy named Jason. If you like drawing, try drawing or doodling in your notebook. Draw a rough sketch of the teacher overseeing detention. Draw a picture of a scene outside. Doodle a fun comic to pass the time."

      "title": "Create a challenge for yourself.",
      "content": "Create a challenge for yourself. Oftentimes, boredom stems from a lack of challenges. If you're being forced to sit and do nothing, this can grow boring. If you want to combat boredom, try to think of a challenge for yourself to pass the time. Think of your favorite song. See if you can write down the lyrics from memory. Write the alphabet down the side of a piece of paper. Then, pick a category, like \"Girl's names.\" Try to think of three girl's name for every letter of the alphabet. For example, \"A. Ava, Ada, Annie, B. Bonnie, Bridget, Brita, C. Cassie, Carol, Camille...\" It may seem easy, but it can get tricky when you get to letters like \"X\" and \"Y.\" Is there a clock in the room? If so, try to write down that poem you had to memorize for 8th grade English on a piece of paper. See how long it takes to write it down. Then, try to beat that time."

      "title": "Read.",
      "content": "Read. If you're allowed to do so, reading can be a great way to pass the time. You can escape to the world of a book, making the hours fly by more easily. Ideally, you should choose a book you're reading for pleasure. If you're reading a book for school, you may feel bored by it more easily. However, some schools may have rules that dictate you have to do homework during detention. Try to at least pick a book that deals with a subject you enjoy. If you loathe your science class, but always enjoyed history, thumb through your history textbook during detention. Some teachers may allow you to read as long as it's educational. Try to find fun educational books in your school's library. New Journalism, for example, is a form of journalism that uses literary techniques to talk about historical events. It can be more engaging than a typical history book. Try reading some Gore Vidal and Joan Didion and see if you feel engaged."

      "title": "Listen to music or podcasts on your headphones.",
      "content": "Listen to music or podcasts on your headphones. If you're able to listen to your headphones in detention, this can be a fun way to pass the time. Try listening to a podcast you like or an album you enjoy. This can make detention pass by more easily. If you're not allowed to listen to your headphones, you may be able to do so in secret. If you have a hooded sweatshirt, for example, pull up your hood and place your headphones in your ears. If you're listening to anything not appropriate for school, keep the volume low so your teacher doesn't overhear."

      "title": "Take a walk through the halls.",
      "content": "Take a walk through the halls. Oftentimes, a short walk can help to alleviate boredom. If you feel like the time is dragging on, a short walk through the hallway can break up the monotony. Ask for the bathroom pass or claim you need to get something from your locker. Then, enjoy the freedom of walking through the hallway for a few minutes. Try not to be gone too long. If you take 15 minutes to run to the bathroom, or are getting your science book for 20 minutes, your teacher will get suspicious. You may end up in more trouble than you were to begin with."

      "title": "Daydream.",
      "content": "Daydream. Daydreaming can be an excellent way to pass the time in any given situation. It's particularly nice in detention because it's risk free. Your teacher cannot read your thoughts, so you'll be able to daydream without getting in trouble. Fantasize about imaginary realities. For example, what would it be like if you had super powers? How would you feel to be part of your favorite television show? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to meet a celebrity? [2] X Research source Allow your daydreams to occur organically. It's very hard to force yourself to daydream if you're not in the mood. If you're struggling to daydream during detention, try to do something else. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Play with your phone.",
      "content": "Play with your phone. If you're allowed to have your phone out during detention, playing with your phone can be a great way to pass time. You can text your friends, watch videos, go on the internet, play games, or listen to music. If you're not allowed to have your cell phone in detention, you may not want to risk it. It's very hard to stealthily use a cell phone, and you may risk getting your phone taken away if you're using it in detention. Be careful when using the internet. If your school does not have wifi, streaming movies on Netflix can eat up a lot of your data."

      "title": "Complete any required activities.",
      "content": "Complete any required activities. If you have to do certain activities during detention, try to take them seriously. While they may not seem fun, in comparison to sitting around with nothing to do, they may seem like a relief. Do not rush through activities and end up bored for the next 40 minutes. In detention, you may have to write down why you got in trouble. A teacher may ask you to reflect on your actions in an essay, for example. Try to do the best you can. Spend some time seriously considering the assignment. You may learn something from the required assignment. If you're in detention because you hurt a student or teacher's feelings, for example, it's important that you reflect on what you said."

      "title": "Do your homework.",
      "content": "Do your homework. While doing homework may not seem like fun, it's a good way to pass the time. You may feel like you're having fun if you feel like you're being productive. Doing homework can give you a feeling of accomplishment, which can be enjoyable. Try to do assignment you'd be likely to put off at home. This way, when you finish detention you can relax and unwind. If the person supervising detention is a teacher, doing homework in that teacher's subject can be a good way to pass time. If your algebra teacher is supervising you, you'll be able to ask for his or her help if you're struggling with a math problem."

      "content": "Do extra credit. You may not have homework to do during detention. However, there are other ways to be productive and make the time go by faster. Are any of your teachers offering extra credit? You could take your detention period as an opportunity to complete an extra credit assignment. You'll end up passing the time while earning additional points in your course."

      "content": "Set some goals for yourself. Do you have any goals you want to set for yourself? Detention could be a good to reflect on your goals. If you're in middle school or high school, you may want to start thinking about your future. Make plans for your education. If you want to get into a decent school, think about what you can do to increase your chances. What extracurricular activities would look good on an application, for example? Should you work on bringing your grades up in any subjects? [4] X Research source Set dates for yourself. For example, if you're working on a short story, pull out a calendar. Plan to have a draft done by, say, the 15th of February. Then, plan to have that revised by the 8th of March. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Know the teacher's personality. It's great to try to make the most out of a negative situation. However, you want to make sure you avoid getting into further trouble. Know who's running the detention and what that teacher's personality is like. Some teachers may be very strict and vigilant while others may be somewhat lax about the rules. If you don't know the teacher, ask other students who've worked with this teacher in the past. They may be able to offer some insight that can help you navigate detention. If you're stuck with a strict teacher, make a point of following the rules. Even if it's difficult, you want to avoid getting into further trouble."

      "title": "Respect the rules.",
      "content": "Respect the rules. What are the rules in your school regarding conduct for detention? Make sure you know them going into detention. You want to avoid getting into more trouble. You do not want to end up in detention in another week or have to face more serious consequences. If your school has strict rules, try to follow them. Some rules are easily bendable. For example, while outside reading may be forbidden, a particular teacher may not strictly enforce such rules. In that situation, bend the rules to pass the time. However, if a teacher asks you to stop a particular behavior, do not push it. You are in detention for a reason. Being disrespectful of the rules could land you in more trouble."

      "title": "Reflect on why you're in detention.",
      "content": "Reflect on why you're in detention. During detention, take some time to reflect on why you're there. You may be able to figure out how to avoid ending up in detention in the future. If you're in detention because you had too many tardies, think of ways to better manage your time. Plan to get up an hour early in the mornings. Think about avoiding checking your phone or going on the computer until you're showered and dressed. If you're in detention for disrespecting a teacher, consider why you were disrespectful. You do not want to get in trouble again. If you have trouble managing your outbursts, talk to your parents about possibly seeing a psychiatrist to talk about regulating your emotions. If you hurt another student's feelings, reflect on how that student may feel. Think about the comments you made. Imagine how you would feel if someone said something like that about you or a friend. After detention, make an effort to genuinely apologize to that student."
