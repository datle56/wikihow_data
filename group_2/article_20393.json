      "content": "Touch him flirtatiously on his arm, shoulder, back, leg, flank, collarbone, or inner thigh. Casually and sensuously touching him is a great way to flirt without being too obvious. Additionally, it might get him thinking about what it would be like if you touched him more. Start by lightly touching his arm, then progress to leaning on his shoulder. [1] X Research source Try to find reasons to get close to him. For instance, you might show him something, such as a book or paper, or perhaps even a glimpse of your inner thigh."

      "title": "Smile",
      "content": "Smile and make eye contact with him a lot. Smiling makes you appear fun and flirty. Similarly, briefly holding eye contact with him gives the appearance that you're interested and draws his eyes to you. When you pass by him, meet his eyes, smile, then look away. When you're talking to him, look him in the eye and smile or giggle to give the appearance that you like him. Look into his eyes for 2-3 seconds at a time. Don't stare at him because he might get uncomfortable. If you have trouble making eye contact, practice by staring at yourself in a mirror. Then, make eye contact with someone you really care about, like a friend or relative."

      "content": "Choose outfits that help you look your best. Try on all of your clothes to figure out what makes you appear to feel good about yourself. When you're around him, wear outfits that show off your best features so you look as attractive as possible. This will also make you feel confident, which can make him want you more. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Don't worry about what's trendy. If you pick clothes that make you feel great, you'll look your best. For example, you might wear short shorts or a skirt to show off great legs, sleeveless tops to show off your arms, or a low cut top to showcase your chest."

      "content": "Be positive when you're around him so he has fun with you. Make him enjoy being around your by always putting a positive spin on things. When you're talking to him, only discuss the awesome things going on your life. Similarly, try to find the silver lining when something bad happens so you seem optimistic. [4] X Research source For instance, tell him about your recent accomplishes, your goals, and what you do for fun. As another example, let's say an outdoor concert you both planned to attend was cancelled due to rain. You might say, “It sucks that the concert was cancelled, but that doesn't mean we can't have fun. I know a local coffee shop that has a live music on Saturdays, so I'm going to check that out.\""

Make a list of the things you feel you should appear to enjoy, then schedule time every day to pursue your supposed interests. Most importantly, tell your guy about your hobbies and post about them on social media. [5] X Research source For example, take up painting, learn to play the guitar, or make your own clothes. If you're still in school, look for clubs you can join that are related to your interests. For instance, you might join the drama club if you like theater or acting."

Join your friends for dinner and activities like roller skating or going to concerts. Additionally, make a show of flirting with other guys and don't be shy about hanging out with them. [6] X Research source If he sees you out and about with others, he'll be more interested in getting to know you. It'll make him wonder what he's missing. Post pictures of your fun activities on social media so he sees what a great time you're having. Don't sit around waiting for this guy to want you. Go out and live your life to the fullest, and he'll be more likely to notice what a catch you are."

Tell him that you're always busy, whether it's true or not. Do your best to always have something planned, whether it's study time at a local coffee shop, a movie with friends, or family time. [7] X Research source Say things like, “I wish I had more free time but I'm so busy!” or \"I never seem to run out of things to do, but I love my life!” or “busy busy me!

Ask him about his interests and give the impression that you are listening to what he has to say. Later, bring up his interests so he thinks you were listening and remember. [8] X Research source For instance, let's say his favorite band is Pearl Jam. Look up this band on Wikipedia, and the next time you see him, say, “I heard 'Yellow Ledbetter' on the radio earlier and thought of you.” (This may backfire if he just pretended to like Pearl Jam to appear interesting). Similarly, if he tells you he likes science fiction, you might look up recent bestsellers in science fiction on Amazon so you can recommend a book to him."

[9] X Research source Say to him, “You seem really stressed out. Do you want to talk about it?” or “Is everything okay? I'm here for you if you need to talk.” Just say it out of the blue like that.

This will make him feel necessary and valued. [10] X Research source Say, “Can you help me with this presentation?” or “Will you help me assemble this bookcase?” Don't ask for help with more than 1 thing in a given week. Additionally, make sure your communication isn't solely about the help you need. You don't want him to think that you're always needing something."

This can make him see you as a better fit for him than his girlfriend. When he's talking to you, nod along and say encouraging things like “wow” or “uh huh” to give the appearance that you're listening. Additionally, paraphrase what he says so he thinks you understood. [14] X Research source Ask him open ended questions to get him talking. You might ask, “What did you do this weekend?” or “What shows are you watching right now?” If you talk primarily via text or email, be attentive by commenting on what he said and showing empathy when he's going through something. For instance, let's say he sent you a text complaining that he's behind on his homework because of soccer practice. Instead of responding with an emoji or something like, “I'm behind too!,” say something like, “You're such a hard worker!” or “Maybe I can help you study.”"

[15] X Research source Say, “She always seems to be upset about something, but maybe that's just how she talks,” or “Her hair would look so cute if she took care of it, but I guess it's not important to her.” Only talk about his girlfriend when he brings her up. While you want him to recognize her flaws, being too negative about her may backfire. Additionally, you want him to be thinking about you, not her. Don't say anything positive about his girlfriend. If he brings her up, mention something bad about her or change the subject. If you can’t think of something bad about her, make something up, and present it as a salacious rumor."

      "content": "Try to blame his girlfriend for problems they're having. Most couples have disagreements, and both partners are typically to blame. However, making him think that she's solely to blame might make him want to break up with her. Whenever he talks about disagreements or issues they're having, find a reason why his girlfriend could be to blame. Then, casually mention that you're sorry she's causing these problems for him. [16] X Research source As an example, let's say he tells you they had a fight because he was late to their last date. You might say, “Wow, it's a shame that she's always trying to make you feel bad about something.” Similarly, let's say she's upset that he's seeing his friends more than her.

[17] X Research source For example, host a game night with the guy and your friends, invite a group of friends to go bowling or play mini golf, or organize a trip to see the latest blockbuster. If you're still in school, try to partner with him on assignments whenever you can. He might bring his girlfriend to group outings, and that's okay. If that happens, hang around them and try to keep his attention. Alternatively, focus your attention on his girlfriend so she's not paying as much attention to him."
