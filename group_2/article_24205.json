      "title": "Spread the screen out on the ground.",
      "content": "Spread the screen out on the ground. Spread out the screen, laying it over the ground or another large, flat surface. Make sure the magnets are aligned in the middle. Note that the top of the screen will likely have a larger gap between the magnets and curtains than the bottom."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the magnets to make sure they align symmetrically.",
      "content": "Check the magnets to make sure they align symmetrically. While the screen is laid out, open and close the magnets down the middle to see if they attract. Be sure that each set of magnets lines up evenly. If the magnets are not symmetrical, this could leave a gap in your screen that will let bugs into your home. Note that you will need to separate each pair of magnets before installing the screen."

      "title": "Attach the adhesive strips to the screen frame.",
      "content": "Attach the adhesive strips to the screen frame. Peel the backing off of the soft side of each adhesive strip. Apply the exposed adhesive directly to the back of the screen. Spread each of the strips provided across the entire frame of the mesh. [1] X Research source Make sure that each strip sticks to the screen securely."

      "title": "Wipe down the door frame and let it air dry.",
      "content": "Wipe down the door frame and let it air dry. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away any dirt or debris from the surface of your door frame. Grime can prevent the adhesive strips from sticking to the door frame. Allow the frame to air dry naturally before installing the screen. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Measure the door's height to determine how high to hang the screen.",
      "content": "Measure the door's height to determine how high to hang the screen. Use a measuring tape to measure the height of the door frame. Taking into account the length of the screen, calculate whether or not the mesh will drag on the ground. With a pencil, mark the point you need to hang the top of the mesh to prevent it from touching the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the door's width and mark the halfway point.",
      "content": "Measure the door's width and mark the halfway point. Use a measuring tape to measure the width of your door frame. Note that measurement, then divide it in half to determine where the middle of the door is. Mark the center point with a pencil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the top, middle part of the screen first.",
      "content": "Attach the top, middle part of the screen first. Remove the backings of the adhesive strips that you placed at the halfway point on top of your screen. Line up the top of the mesh with the line you marked on top of your door frame. Attach this part of the mesh to the frame. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue sticking the rest of the mesh to your door frame.",
      "content": "Continue sticking the rest of the mesh to your door frame. After attaching the top part of your screen, continue around the perimeter of the door. Start with the top of the screen, moving out towards one side of the door and then the other. Continue down each side of the door frame, making sure that the mesh hangs evenly. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Reinforce the mesh with tacks if you have a wooden door frame.",
      "content": "Reinforce the mesh with tacks if you have a wooden door frame. For added security, reinforce the screen by inserting tacks around the perimeter of the door frame. Put the tacks through the mesh, above or below the adhesive strips. Push the tacks into the wooden frame. This step is only applicable if you have a wooden door frame. Omit this step if you are installing your screen around any other type of door."

    {
      "title": "Test the screen.",
      "content": "Test the screen. Test out your screen by walking through the center of it several times. The magnets should split apart as you walk through them and close back together once you leave the doorway. If the screen does not work as designed, you may need to reinstall it, moving the panels closer or further apart as necessary."
