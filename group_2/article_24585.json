There are 6 counts to the basic movement, and the beat sounds like: 1-2-3-a-4, 5-a-6. [1] X Research source Counts 1 and 2 are called the “link steps” or \"rock steps”. Counts 3 and 4 are a triple step to the left called a \"chasse”. Counts 5 and 6 are a triple step, or \"chasse\" to the right."

The idea is to rock back on your back foot and then rock forward on your front foot, shifting the weight to your back foot and then to your front foot. However, you should always lift your feet up as you shift the weight backward and then forward. Practice a few “rock steps” to get the feel for this move. It is an essential step to the jive."

Once you both feel comfortable with the basic jive steps, begin to jive to music. There are several popular mixes with good jive tracks available online. [11] X Research source Jive music tends to have a faster tempo than swing music, so as you practice the steps and get better, you can also learn to move at a faster speed or tempo. Mimic the music’s tempo by accenting your foot and leg movements. To do this, shift your hips as you shift your weight back to your left foot or your right foot in the rock step. Keep your knees bent and try to highlight the counts in the music with the 6 counts in the jive steps. Continue practicing the basic jive steps with accented movements to music until you both feel confident enough with the dance."
