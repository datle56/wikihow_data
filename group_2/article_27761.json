      "content": "Do a quick check for potential hazards. If you or your partner has loose brackets on his/her braces, you will need to be careful. If you’re the one with the braces, check them carefully before you’re planning to kiss anyone. It isn't very likely that one of you will get stuck. Modern braces tend to be less obtrusive than the ones in classic movies where two hapless teens get stuck together. However, a stray wire or bracket could poke your partner, which could kill the mood."

      "content": "Coat your braces with orthodontic wax. Most orthodontists will give you some of this after attaching your braces. It’s good for keeping your braces from cutting the inside of your mouth while you’re getting used to them. Wax will also keep the wires from your braces from poking out, reducing the chance of them getting caught on your partner's braces or face."

      "content": "Warn your partner that you have braces. He or she might not have kissed anyone with braces before. Explain that he or she will need to tell you if your braces are poking him/her. Tell your partner s/he probably shouldn’t touch your braces with the tongue or lips -- this can get really painful. Even though this can be embarrassing to talk about, it’s better to do it before it happens."

      "title": "Start kissing your partner.",
      "content": "Start kissing your partner. Be gentle. Try lots of small kisses at first so that you get used to kissing someone with your braces in and s/he gets used to kissing someone with braces. If it’s going well, keep going and try for longer kisses. Figure out what you like best and do it. You might want to avoid too much tongue when making out, as getting it caught on your braces will not be fun. Focus on using your lips to caress your partner. Ask him or her to do so as well. Keep your kissing soft and gentle to avoid getting tangled."
