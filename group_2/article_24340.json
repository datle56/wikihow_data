      "title": "Evaluate the results with your doctor.",
      "content": "Evaluate the results with your doctor. The best way to interpret your blood results is by talking to your doctor. They understand the information and results better than anyone. Making an assessment on your own can lead to misdiagnosis or complications from self-treatment. Ask your doctor any questions you may have about individual or total levels and what they may indicate. Have your doctor go through each series of numbers individually, explaining what they test for and what your specific results may mean. Ask your doctor to compare previous results with the new ones to better judge where you are physically."

This measures the number of hydrogen ions in your blood, which may indicate conditions such as COPD, asthma, pregnancy, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), lung disease, liver disease, or drug use. [1] X Research source The normal range for pH values are between 7.35 to 7.45. [2] X Research source If the pH level is below 7.38, then you may have more acidic blood from conditions such as airway obstruction, COPD, asthma, sleep disordered breathing, or neuromuscular impairment. [3] X Research source If the pH level is above 7.45, you may have a alkalosis, which could indicate stimulation of the central nervous system, lung disease, severe anemia, drug use, or pregnancy."

      "content": "Check bicarbonate, or HCO 3 , numbers. Your kidneys produce bicarbonate and help maintain a normal pH. The normal level for bicarbonate is between 22 to 26 milliEquivalents Per Liter (mEq/L). A disruption of your bicarbonate levels may indicate conditions such as respiratory failure, anorexia, and liver failure. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source An HCO 3 level is below 24 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis. It may be the result of conditions including diarrhea, liver failure and kidney disease. An HCO 3 level above 26 mEq/L indicates metabolic alkalosis. This may be the result of dehydration, vomiting, and anorexia."

Disrupted levels may indicate shock, kidney failure, or chronic vomiting. Respiratory alkalosis is present if the PaCO 2 number is below 35 mmHg. This means there is too little carbon dioxide in the blood. It can signal kidney failure, shock, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperventilation, pain, or anxiety.

This means that there is too much carbon dioxide in the blood. This can be a sign of chronic vomiting, low blood potassium, COPD, or pneumonia."
