      "content": "Choose a deep container with drainage holes in the bottom. [1] X Research source You'll need a container that is at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep. The width of the container is up to you, depending on the space you have available and how many onions you’d like to grow. [2] X Research source If you’d like bigger onions, go with a deeper container to give it space to sprout. To grow several onions, try a wide, tub-shaped container. Onions need about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of space between each plant to grow. The type of container is up to you. You can grow the onions in plastic, ceramic, glass, or any other material that matches your style, decor, and budget. You can even grow them in recyclable plastic bottles."

      "content": "Fill the container with a simple potting mix soil. Onions are hearty vegetables and do not need any complex or expensive soil. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the top of the soil and the top of the container. While not necessary for the onions to grow, you can opt for a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to increase the quality and the size of your onions. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Save a starter onion bulb from leftover cooking scraps. The part of the onion where the roots grow is what you need for planting. Usually this part is cut off and discarded when cooking, but instead of throwing it away, save it and set it aside for planting. [4] X Research source You can also use an entire onion bulb, but it’s not necessary. You only need the end that the roots sprout from."

      "content": "Plant the onion bulb about 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the soil. Make a pit with your fingers, about 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep, and place the bulb inside. Then, cover the bulb with soil and add water until the soil is just moist. The soil should not be soaking wet, but it should feel damp to the touch."

      "content": "Place your potted onion where it can get 6-7 hours of sunlight per day. Depending on where you live and the time of year, it may be impossible to give the plant this much sunlight. In that case, you can supplement the sun’s light with an artificial light source. [5] X Research source You can use a regular fluorescent or incandescent light or purchase a grow lamp online or from a gardening center or home improvement store. If you are forgetful or don't want the hassle of remembering to time the lights, you can regulate the timing with an inexpensive home timer or by buying a light fixture with a built-in timer. These are all available at any home improvement store or garden center."

      "content": "Water your plant enough to keep it moist at all times. Check the soil daily and add water to maintain consistent moisture. To test it, press on the top of the soil with a dry finger. If the top of soil is dry and brittle, then you need to add a little water. [6] X Research source In a mild climate, your onion plant will need a minimum of 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water per week. If your weather is hot or the air is particularly dry, you will need more.

You can wait longer to allow the bulb to grow bigger, but once it reaches 3 inches (7.6 cm), you can dig out the onion, clean it, and eat it.

[8] X Research source Ideally, your container should be at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep to allow space for roots to grow. However, you can start with a smaller container and move the plants after they've begun to sprout. The width of the container is up to you, depending on the space you have available and how many onions you’d like to grow. [9] X Research source Drainage holes are important when planting seeds because if the soil is too wet, the seeds will not sprout. [10] X Research source The container does not have to be partitioned, but it helps to have the plant contained to a small section when transplanting to a larger pot later."

Then, cover the seeds with a light layer of soil and add water until just moist. Using more than one seed per partition will increase your chances of growing a viable plant. Onions seeds are good for up to two years, but fresh seeds will germinate quicker and produce better results. [12] X Research source"

If you live in a location where that is not possible, use an artificial light source to supplement the sun's light. [13] X Research source You can use a regular fluorescent or incandescent light or purchase a grow lamp online or from a gardening center or home improvement store. The idea is to replicate the amount of the light the plant would normally receive, so you don't want to leave it on all day.
