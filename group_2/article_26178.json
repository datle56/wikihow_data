We'll be going over how to use the AutoHotkey Keyboard Locker by Sophice on GitHub, but feel free to use any keyboard locker based on AHK scripts. Download the latest release of AutoHotkey Keyboard Locker on GitHub . We recommend downloading the executable file, as downloading the source code involves installing another program. As such, the steps in this section will be for the executable. There are alternative AutoHotkey Keyboard Locker scripts available that are programmed to lock the keyboard with a different shortcut (i.e. Ctrl + Alt + L ). The method to install these scripts should be the same as the instructions below, but always check your source for specific instructions. Always be careful when downloading software from the internet, and only download programs you trust."
