      "content": "Know what you have in store. Starting off an article about weight-loss this way is hardly motivating, but it helps to cut to the chase: It's extremely difficult to lose 30 pounds in two months. Expert doctors and dietitians agree that losing 1 to 2 pounds per week is healthy. [1] X Research source Even if you lose 3 pounds per week for 9 weeks, you're still short of hitting your weight-loss goal. While it's certainly possible to lose 30 pounds in two months, whether or not it's healthy is another question. Healthy weight loss comes from trimming pounds off of fat reserves without triggering the starvation response . When you cut down your caloric intake so low that your body thinks you're starving, it actually begins shedding muscle instead of fat. This is not a healthy trend. It's hard to drop pounds simply by eating less, too which is unhealthy depending on what kind of food it is. Fat is needed, but it isn't healthy to overdose the amount. Protein is needed significantly for your health. They are used to make muscles, tendons, skin, and organ. [2] X Expert Source Pouya Shafipour, MD, MS Board Certified Family Medicine Specialist Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. When you cut your calories significantly, your body actually has a harder time shedding pounds. This phenomenon is called diet induced adaptive thermogenesis . Perhaps it's a mechanism for survival, or perhaps it's a way for our bodies to maintain a comfortable body weight. Whatever it is — and as crazy as it sounds — you need to take in calories in order to lose weight."

For reference, you can expect to burn between 100 and 125 calories running a mile at a semi-comfortable speed. [4] X Research source At that pace, it would take about 28 miles (45 km), or more than a marathon, in order to shed a single pound of weight. People who run marathons routinely lose 7 pounds during a typical race, but much of that loss (~6 lbs.) is water weight. [5] X Research source"

When they're planning on shedding 15+ pounds, that sort of stalemate is incredibly discouraging: They soon give up because their goals are too lofty and their results are too few. Instead of falling victim to this dieter's dilemma, break down your goals into more manageable chunks so that if you fail to see immediate results, you don't get discouraged and quit. You want to lose 30 pounds in two months, so your mini goals are losing 15 pounds per month or 3.3 pounds per week. Losing 30 pounds can seem daunting. Losing 15 sounds more manageable. Losing 3.3 sounds downright doable."

Here's one trick that you can use to feel more full before meals. Down an 8-ounce glass of water right before you eat.

Skipping breakfast means you're asking your body to fast to 15 to 20 hours. When this happens, your body can't produce the necessary enzymes to metabolize fat efficiently, setting you up for failure. [20] X Research source If you get hungry, eat a healthy, nutritious snack in between meals. Carrots and hummus, or celery and tuna mixed with olive oil and lemon juice. Get creative, but be sure that the \"snack\" you choose for yourself falls within whatever diet you've given yourself. Try as much as possible to take a light dinner. Many people say that your metabolism slows down during the night, taking it harder for your body to digest large amounts of food eaten during dinner. While there's no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest this, there is good reason to keep dinner light.
