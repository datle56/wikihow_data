      "content": "Choose cremation if you move often or burial is otherwise impractical. Cremate your cat if you expect to move in the near future and don’t want to leave behind its remains in a burial site. Cremation is also your best option if you don’t own private property. In many locations, it’s only legal to bury a pet in land that you own. [1] X Research source Ask your cat’s vet any questions you have about the cremation facility and how your pet’s remains will be treated, especially if you have concerns about getting the right ashes. If your pet was put to sleep, cremation eliminates the risk of exposing chemicals to the environment. The substances used to euthanize animals can be harmful to the water table. [2] X Research source Additionally, if your pet passed away due to an infectious disease, cremation can help prevent the illness from spreading. Burying it could threaten pets and other animals in the area."

      "content": "Bring your deceased cat to the vet promptly if it passed at home. If your cat passed at the vet office, the staff can make all the arrangements necessary for cremation. On the other hand, if it passed at home, call the vet, place your deceased cat in a bag or container for transport, and take it to the office as soon as possible. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you need to store your deceased cat for any reason, place it in a tightly sealed bag and keep it in a cooler, refrigerator, or freezer. Note that you shouldn’t freeze it if you’ve asked the vet to perform a necropsy (autopsy). If your cat is sick and you are worried it might die soon or that it will need euthanasia, talk with your cat’s vet ahead of time about disposal of the remains. It will help to have this plan in place ahead of time since you will likely be distressed later on."

      "content": "Ask for an individual cremation if you want a private memorial. Go with individual cremation if you want your cat’s remains returned to you. While it’s more expensive, pets are cremated separately so their owners can keep their ashes. [4] X Research source If honoring your pet is important, some crematories allow pet owners to visit the facilities to help verify that remains are handled with dignity. [5] X Research source You may want to look into a getting a scatter box of your cat’s ashes. This is often an inexpensive option and you can scatter the ashes in a place that your cat loved to spend time."

      "title": "Discuss communal cremation if you need the most practical option.",
      "content": "Discuss communal cremation if you need the most practical option. If individual cremation isn’t affordable or desired, tell the vet or crematory you’re going with communal cremation. Just keep in mind your cat’s remains will not be returned to you. If you’re concerned about what happens to remains, check with the crematorium. [6] X Research source Communal cremation is generally a fraction of the cost of individual cremation. Typically, remains are buried at a specially licensed site after cremation."

      "content": "Fill out any required forms and pay the fee. After you’ve made your decision, you’ll be asked to fill out a cremation authorization form. You’ll enter information including your name and contact information, whether you want individual or communal cremation, and whether you want your pet’s ashes returned to you. [7] X Research source Finally, you’ll pay the fee, which depends on the type of cremation and whether any additional products and services are included (such as delivery or an urn). Individual cremations for cats are usually between $100 and $200 (U.S.), while communal are often in the $20 to $50 range. [8] X Research source If you opted for individual cremation, the time it takes to receive your cat’s remains will vary by the crematorium, but you will likely need to wait at least 1 week. Either pick them up at the vet’s office or have the crematorium deliver them to your home."

      "content": "Check your local regulations on burying deceased pets. Burying a pet is legal in most areas, but there may be some restrictions. For starters, you may required to own the land or get permission from your landlord. Additionally, factor in how long you expect to stay in your home and whether you’re okay with leaving your pet’s remains if you move. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If your cat passed away due to an infectious disease, remember that burial isn’t the best option.

A good option could be spot where your cat loved to lounge. [10] X Research source Be sure that the location is safe and complies with local regulations. For instance, it may need to be at least 9 feet (2.7 m) away from water sources, cables, and pipes."

A depth of 3 feet (0.91 m) should work but, if you’re burying your cat in a vessel, the hole may need to be deeper. [11] X Research source To memorialize your cat, you could place its favorite toys or other meaningful objects in the burial site. Keep in mind that some wild animals will dig down to scavenge a buried pet. If you have wild animals in your area, then it might be better to have your cat cremated."

You could also plant flowers, seeds, or a tree sapling to help commemorate your pet.

While this service is often deeply personal, it can be expensive. Additionally, it’s most practical to make arrangements with a pet cemetery in advance instead of after your cat has passed. [13] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source A pet cemetery could also be a good option if you expect to move but want to be able to regularly visit your cat’s burial site.

Try searching online for the website of your local department of sanitation or waste management. [14] X Research source Depending on your location, you'll either call for a special pick-up or put it in your garbage receptacle for standard collection. You may also be required to bring it to a landfill or bury it yourself. Another option is to contact your local veterinary clinic and allow them to arrange for disposal of the cat.

In the U.S., you typically call a non-emergency municipal services line, such as 3-1-1, to schedule a pick-up. [15] X Research source While some jurisdictions offer scheduled pick-ups, they may only do so if the deceased cat is on public property. If the cat is on a public sidewalk or street, you’ll probably only need to tell the operator its location.

If your jurisdiction allows small animals to be placed in standard garbage bins, first place the cat in a heavy-duty plastic bag. Seal the bag and, for best results, double bag it. You may also be required to label the bag “dead cat” or “deceased cat.” [16] X Research source To avoid coming into direct contact with the animal, turn the bag inside out, use it to scoop up the remains, then turn it right-side out again. It’s like the technique you’d use to pick up after a dog when it goes potty. Do not put an animal in the trash if you suspect it had rabies or another infectious disease.
