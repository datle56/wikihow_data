      "content": "Enter the two numbers that you want to call each other. To pull off this prank, you’ll need to know the phone numbers of both people you want to prank.

      "content": "Listen to the call or record it to play back later. On some websites, this call works similar to a 3-way call—once both people pick up the phone, you’ll be able to hear the call live, so you can enjoy the fun as it’s happening! Depending on where you live, you may also have the option to record the call so you can share it with friends later. On some apps, you won’t be able to hear the call until both of the other people hang up. [1] X Research source You need to have the permission of everyone on the call to record a conversation in CA, CT, FL, IL, MA, MD, MI, MT, NH, NV, PA, or WA."

      "content": "Choose friends who will think the prank is funny. Keep the call fun for everyone by only pranking friends with a great sense of humor. Don’t call businesses or people you don’t know, and don’t call anyone with the intention of harassing or annoying them—that could be illegal in some areas. [2] X Research source Don't prank call someone because of their race, sexual orientation, disability status, or other protected characteristics. This could be considered a hate crime and may have more serious consequences. Only call during normal daytime hours. Calling late at night or very early in the morning (like after 9 p.m. or before 7 a.m.) could be considered harassment. Don’t call the same number repeatedly, and don’t call back if someone asks you not to. [3] X Research source If you join in on the call, don’t use obscene or threatening language.

      "content": "Never prank call emergency services. In most states, it’s illegal to prank call 911, and it could get you into serious legal trouble. And the consequences could be even more severe if you prevent someone from getting the emergency help they need because they can’t get through to 911 or first responders are dispatched as a result of your prank call.

In some states, you only need the consent of one person to record the call—in that case, you can legally record as long as you stay on the call the whole time. [6] X Research source In other states, it’s only legal to record a call if everyone involved has agreed to the recording. Since that would defeat the purpose of a prank, most websites won’t allow you to record if someone on the call lives in one of those states."

[7] X Research source To be safe—and to have a good laugh at the end of the call—let your friends know that you called them as a prank. If you're using a website that doesn't let you join the call live, call your friends separately to tell them about the prank."

But if you make repeated calls or the other person feels threatened, harassed, or frightened, it could turn into a legal issue.

      "content": "How do I avoid getting caught? Your phone number won’t be shown if you use a prank call website. If you want to be extra secretive, you could use a burner phone to hide your phone number or a VPN to mask your ISP. But we recommend coming clean at the end of the call, so this probably isn’t necessary. Using a burner phone or a VPN would make it harder for the prank website to identify you if someone tried to find out who started the call."

It can be fun to call friends who are in the same room as each other, since they’ll both be confused when they see each others’ names pop up on the phone. Or you could call two people who don’t know each other very well, since they’ll be extra confused why they’re getting a call."
