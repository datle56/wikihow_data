      "title": "Listen to your gut.",
      "content": "Listen to your gut. Those who believe in psychic powers feel those who have them can sense things before they occur. Spiritual Life Coach Jennifer McVey explains, \"we all have psychic senses, like your intuition or that sixth sense that [...] there's something going on.\" In other words, you may be prone to very strong \"gut feelings\" one way or another about a situation. [1] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 January 2022. Try to tune in to your gut feeling over the course of a few days and see how accurate it is. [2] X Research source You may get gut feelings about a situation that prove to be true. This does not have to be something major. It can be a small gut feeling. For example, you feel drawn into a clothing store to find the perfect outfit."

      "title": "See if you make small-scale predictions.",
      "content": "See if you make small-scale predictions. Not all predictions are major. While some people claim to have predicted natural disasters or other major events, many people who think they have psychic powers can make predictions on a small scale. Pay attention to whether tiny flashes of intuition prove true. [3] X Research source Spiritual Life Coach Jennifer McVey suggests tethering your predictions to physical objects like tarot cards at first: \"Your subconscious mind is the part of the mind that creates your life. So it's also the part of the mind that would know what card was in that deck in the order they're all in. So if you're needing an answer to a question [...] and you pull a tarot card, your subconscious mind would automatically stop shuffling at the perfect time for you to get the answer that you need at that moment.\" [4] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 January 2022. You can also pay attention to nonphysical things. For example, you may know who's calling the second your phone rings, predict the general timeframe a package will arrive to your house, or know what song will play on the radio next. Some of these small predictions may be a coincidence or based on knowledge you already have. If your mom always calls at a certain time, for example, it's not unusual to assume she's calling when your phone rings. However, if such predictions occur frequently, they could be a sign of psychic powers."

      "title": "Note your capacity for empathy.",
      "content": "Note your capacity for empathy. Those who believe in psychics feel they're more intuitive about other people's emotions. Spiritual Life Coach Jennifer McVey explains, \"it's very different between having empathy for someone and actually being empathetic [meaning] you can actually pick up their feelings and know what they're feeling. That would be your special sense.\" [5] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 January 2022. Think about whether you know someone's feeling without having to be told. If you know someone well, it's not uncommon to sense what they're feeling. People often give off unconscious tells about their feelings, which most people who know them well pick up on. Psychics, however, can allegedly read energy even from strangers. If you have physic powers, you may feel a deep connection to a stranger's energy. You may, for example, pass someone in the grocery store and get a sense of sadness or happiness from them. A psychic's capacity for empathy is allegedly very strong. You will not just be able to sense people's emotions but you may feel them as if they're your own."

      "title": "Evaluate whether you feel past experiences without being told.",
      "content": "Evaluate whether you feel past experiences without being told. Psychics can supposedly get a sense of another person's past and history. This can happen with people who are living or with ghosts. For example, Spiritual Life Coach Jennifer McVey explains that you might \"sense things about people that used to live in a house, or you're talking to someone and they're telling you about a little boy that has passed away and you start getting impressions of what that person was like or what memories they had.\" [6] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 22 January 2022. If so, you may have psychic powers. [7] X Research source This can happen with living people too. For example, you meet a stranger at party and get images in your mind's eye of palm trees and beaches. Later, you find out this person grew up in California. You may also get a sense of experiences from someone's past. For example, you may meet someone and feel a sense of abandonment or deep loss. Later, you may find out something about the person's past that points to this. Maybe one of their parents died young, for example, or left the family."

      "content": "See if you sense danger. Those who feel they have psychic powers feel they can sense danger. Spiritual Life Coach Jennifer McVey emphasizes that this may manifest as a physical feeling of \"your hair [standing up] on your arms. Or that feeling that stands up on the back of your neck, or you'll get goosebumps.\" [8] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 22 January 2022. Think about times when you've had a sense of foreboding. Did this ever prove true? If so, you may be psychically gifted. [9] X Research source For example, you may feel a strong sense you should not enter a building or attend a social event. Later, you may find out something dangerous happened there. For example, maybe there was a fire at a department store you felt wary about entering."

You may, for example, be frightened when alone at night or in the dark."

      "title": "Evaluate your dreams.",
      "content": "Evaluate your dreams. People who believe in psychic powers feel psychics are prone to very vivid dreams. This may be because physics are able to feel the energy of the world around them and this may manifest in very intense dreams. If your dreams are usually vivid, you may have psychic powers. [12] X Research source On occasion, aspects of your dreams may appear in real life. For example, you may dream you lose an object only to really lose it the next day. [13] X Research source"

Those who believe in psychic powers feels psychics are more prone to synesthesia. [15] X Research source You may eventually find your synesthesia helps you make accurate predictions.
