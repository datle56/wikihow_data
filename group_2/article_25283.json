      "content": "Do a “self-scan” to see if your hunger is physical or psychological. When you feel hunger, it can come from 2 things: physical or emotional cues. Physical hunger occurs when your body sends you physical cues (like a growling stomach) that your body needs food. Psychological hunger is often a symptom of boredom, emotions, or advertisements. Decoding what type of hungry you are can help you determine if you’re actually hungry or not. Before eating a meal or snack, take a minute or 2 to ask yourself these questions: [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source What level of hungry are you on a scale of 1 to 10?

Try the apple test as follows: [3] X Research source Ask yourself if you’d like to eat an apple. If the answer is “yes,” your body is likely physically hungry. If the answer is “no,” you may be psychologically or emotionally hungry and have a specific craving.

To know if you’re truly hungry or not, consider the time and what you’ve done so far today. Being mindful of your hunger patterns can help you decipher whether or not you’re actually hungry. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you usually eat lunch around 12 PM and it’s 12:30 PM, you’re likely physically hungry because you missed your regular lunch. Say you just went hiking with some friends. Your stomach may be rumbling a bit more because you used more energy. If you’re watching TV and a commercial for a new cheeseburger comes on, you may find your mouth watering. In this instance, the commercial has made you psychologically hungry, and you’ll likely be able to wait out your craving until your next meal."

Sometimes, even when you try to distract yourself, you find it difficult to stop thinking about it—and that’s okay! This is a sign that your body does want this food. Experts recommend consuming a small, controlled portion of your craving to satisfy your mind and body without unintentionally indulging. For instance, let’s say you’re craving potato chips despite having dinner an hour ago. If distracting yourself with other activities doesn’t work, consider pouring yourself a small bowl following the portion size on the back of the bag. Mindfully eat the chips without distractions, savoring each bite. Then, see if your craving has gone away—do you feel satisfied? If you don’t feel satisfied after answering your craving, dig a little deeper. Ask yourself, “What do I need in this moment to be happy? What am I feeling right now?” [11] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source"
