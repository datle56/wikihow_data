Separate your hair into sections and blow-dry it one section at a time to ensure your hair is dried evenly and thoroughly. Start with one section and run through it with your brush , chasing the brush with the hair dryer to straighten it.

      "content": "Divide up your hair and go over each section once with your flat iron. Use the chase method to straighten your hair and eliminate frizz. First, thread a bunch of hair with a fine-tooth comb near the top of your head. Then, position the flat iron behind the comb and pull both down, so that you're combing your hair from root to tip and chasing the comb with the flat iron. [4] X Research source Repeat the movement for each section of hair until it's all straight! Keep the flat iron's temperature between 350 °F (177 °C) and 450 °F (232 °C), and only go over your hair with the flat iron once to avoid damaging it. Flat iron your hair only once every time you wash it and touch up frizzy spots once per wash too. You don't need to go over your whole head; just apply some heat protectant and fix the problem areas as needed. You can also opt for a professional silk press treatment to straighten your hair at a salon."

Often, this will be enough to keep your hair frizz-free until the humidity subsides (or you get away from the humid weather). [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You could also try a ponytail or braid if you prefer either style. You only need to keep your hair in the bun while exposed to the humidity. You can always let your hair down if you enter a climate-controlled indoor space. In some areas, mornings are more humid than afternoons. Check your local weather to see if you can let your hair out of the bun in the afternoon."

Cross the two halves diagonally and clip them in place with two large clips. If you have longer hair, keep wrapping the hair around your head and clip it as needed. Then, wrap a satin scarf around your head, looping it and tying it in the front, and remove all clips.

Since you'll likely need to shower every couple of days, wrap your hair up with a silk or satin scarf and place a shower cap over it.
