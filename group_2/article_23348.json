      "content": "Look for obvious mistakes or defects on the watch. Note that quality designer watches are made using very strict quality standards, which makes peeling paint, scratches, or misspelled words very unlikely. Additionally, check to make sure that the clasp works, and that the watch itself can keep time well. [1] X Research source For example, some fake Michael Kors watches leave out the “S”. Many low-quality Rolex fakes have badly centered crown stamps. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the watch for crisp, high-quality lettering.",
      "content": "Check the watch for crisp, high-quality lettering. Note that genuine designer watches are crafted by master watchmakers who use precise engraving instruments to create clear, legible lettering on the watch. If any of the lettering is muddled or hard to read, you can assume that the watch is probably a fake. [3] X Research source This rule applies for all of the lettering, including any serial numbers. For example, if the edges around the “R” in “Rolex” look curvy and uneven, you’re likely handling a fake watch."

      "title": "Hold the watch to make sure it's heavy.",
      "content": "Hold the watch to make sure it's heavy. Keep in mind that genuine designer watches are crafted with precious metals and have a lot of small moving parts. Because of this, the watch will feel slightly heavier than it looks. However, if the watch is fake, it will be surprisingly light. [4] X Research source If possible, compare the weight between any watch you consider buying and a verified genuine model. They should be the same weight. For instance, if your designer watch feels feather-light, there’s a good chance that it’s counterfeit."

    {
      "title": "Familiarize yourself with different brand designs.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with different brand designs. Comb through online auction result databases to learn information about the watch you want to purchase. On these databases, look for photos of designer watches as well as the prices they’re sold for. [5] X Research source Similarly, study the manufacturer’s typical design style and become familiar with the brand trademarks, common bracelet details, and the band. If you know what to look for, you likely won’t be fooled by a fake. [6] X Research source For example, with the exception of a rare model made in the 1930s, Rolex watches don't have glass backs. Instead, they have a metal backing. Tag Heuer always includes a “Swiss Made” caption along the bottom of the watch face. [7] X Research source Rolex watches have a “Cyclops,” or small glass square on the face that makes the date look larger. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for an official serial number on the watch.",
      "content": "Look for an official serial number on the watch. Note that designer watches have an alphanumeric number printed somewhere on the watch, which matches with a number provided on the case and/or warranty. Make sure that any numbers or other labels are laser-etched clearly, and not printed sloppily. [9] X Research source For example, an Omega watch has a serial number along the bottom face. These numbers will be laser-etched, and should match with the serial number on your warranty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be suspicious of watches with simple band designs.",
      "content": "Be suspicious of watches with simple band designs. Note that designer watches have a more complex design overall, and likely won’t have a simple band. Look for a complex, consistent design along the links or bracelet of your watch, which generally indicates that it’s luxury and not counterfeit. [10] X Research source For instance, a Tag Heuer watch uses 2 sets of links in the band, while a counterfeit watch might only use 1 link. Omega and Rolex watches usually have bands with at least 3 links or columns."

      "title": "Purchase a designer watch that’s new and not resold.",
      "content": "Purchase a designer watch that’s new and not resold. The best way to avoid fake watches is to buy exclusively from authorized dealers. While it’s more expensive than buying secondhand, you’re much more likely to make a legitimate purchase. When you buy the watch new, it will come with all of the paperwork and serial numbers verifying its authenticity. To find an authorized dealer of your favorite watch, do an online search or talk to the manufacturer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Double-check the serial number with the manufacturer.",
      "content": "Double-check the serial number with the manufacturer. If you're buying the watch secondhand or at an auction, check the serial number with the manufacturer before purchasing it. Note that designer watch manufacturers keep careful records on the different watches they make. Therefore, if the watch you're buying is genuine, you will be able to find documentation on it. [11] X Research source To check the serial number, do an online search or call a customer service representative."

    {
      "title": "Visit an appraiser to check for counterfeits.",
      "content": "Visit an appraiser to check for counterfeits. If you're worried that the deal you're getting is too good to be true, take the watch to a professional appraiser before buying it. If the seller is being honest with you, they will have no problem letting you get the watch appraised. To find an appraiser in your area, do an online search or talk to a fine watch distributor. [12] X Research source Ask the appraiser to determine whether or not the designer watch is real. If they say it's real, have the appraiser walk you through their reasons for believing so. Additionally, the appraiser may be able to tell you whether or not you're getting a fair price."
