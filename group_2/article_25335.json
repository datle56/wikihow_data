      "title": "They only contact you when they want something.",
      "content": "They only contact you when they want something. Beck tells us it’s a red flag if they only text you when they want sex, like late at night. If the texts and calls only come when they’re bored, drunk, or lonely, you may want to consider the possibility that you’re being used for sex. Pay attention to whether you ever hear from them during the day or if they respond to your messages and calls within a reasonable amount of time. If they text you every time they’re out drinking at a bar and it’s late at night, they’re probably looking for a hookup. If you talk often throughout the day about things other than getting together to have sex, there may be more depth to the relationship."

      "title": "They don’t really take you on dates, and prefer to stay in.",
      "content": "They don’t really take you on dates, and prefer to stay in. Beck says another sign is when they don’t just hang out with you, or they make excuses for why they can’t do normal things that aren’t sex. Do they prefer to come over to your place or have you over to theirs? If you ask them to go out and do something, do they seem uninterested? Keep in mind that this could be done under the guise of being romantic—but staying in means the chances of having sex are much higher than if you’re out in public. Some people are just homebodies, and that’s okay! If the person you’re seeing likes to be home, think about how often you spend time together that doesn’t end in them initiating sex."

      "title": "Your conversations always come back to sex.",
      "content": "Your conversations always come back to sex. Beck warns that someone who’s using you will only want to talk about sex, or will find ways to make the conversation about sex. Look at your text messages and see how often the conversation takes on a flirty or sexual tone. Think about whether or not you have conversations that are about everyday things, like work, hobbies, or funny things that happened. Pay attention to how your conversations go when you’re together, too. If things always seem to take a sexual turn, that most likely means that person has only one thing on their mind."
    },
    {
      "title": "They're self-focused and not meeting your sexual needs.",
      "content": "They're self-focused and not meeting your sexual needs. If the other person doesn’t take the time to make sure you both are having a fulfilling experience, they may be interested only in their own needs. If at the end of the night you’re left feeling unsatisfied and unheard, listen to that feeling! It may be that you need to speak up and have a conversation about your needs , but it also could mean that they aren’t concerned about your needs. If you do ask them to try different things or tell them what you prefer and they don’t listen, that’s a clear sign that they’re there for their own benefit."

      "title": "They only compliment your looks, or your sexual performance.",
      "content": "They only compliment your looks, or your sexual performance. It’s nice to be complimented on their looks, but if this person doesn’t seem to notice the other great things about you—like your intelligence, humor, or compassion—they only have one thing on their mind. Or, they might compliment you in hopes of getting sex in return. Think about whether or not you feel known and connected or if you feel like your body is the only thing that matters. Ask them what they find attractive about you. If their list is full of physical descriptions, ask them what they like about you other than your looks. This could jog a deeper discussion or cue you into their true intentions ."

      "content": "They don’t introduce you to their circles. If you’re regularly having sex but have never met any of their friends or family, it could mean that they aren’t interested in having a real relationship with you. Similarly, pay attention to how they act when you mention introducing them to your friends . Are they interested or do they always happen to be busy? Usually, couples make an effort to participate in each others’ lives. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

He says, “You ask your partner to do X and he says ‘Yeah, I'm going to do it’ and they never do that.” A person could tell you lots of sweet, romantic things about how they want to be together, but if their actions don’t match up with those sentiments, they may be using you. If they say they want to go out on nice dates but are always too tired when the time comes around, that signifies that it isn’t a real priority for them. [2] X Research source On the flip-side, if they are saying things like “I just want things to be casual,” or “I’m not looking for a relationship right now,” listen to them. Those are clear statements about their intentions that shouldn’t be ignored."

      "content": "They’re pushy about sex. If you ever say “no” to sex , or tell them that you’re not feeling it, and they try to convince you anyway, that’s a clear sign that they don’t care about your boundaries. They only care about satisfying themselves, and they see you as a tool to get that done. [3] X Research source It’s never okay to keep chasing sex after someone says they don’t want it. If this is the case, it’s best to get some distance. Stop seeing them, if you can, until the two of you can have a serious talk about your boundaries and expectations."

      "content": "Ask them to do something that won’t end in sex to see if they agree. Pick an activity outside of the house that has nothing to do with hooking up, like volunteering, working out, going to a community event, or even just meeting up for a coffee. Make it clear that you have a commitment afterward so you won’t be able to hang out all day or evening and see if they agree. If they always make excuses or are busy, they may not be interested in anything other than sex. [4] X Research source For example, send them a text that says something like, “There’s a super cool event downtown next Saturday morning. Want to meet up and get coffee and walk around together? I have to meet my mom that afternoon, but I’d love to spend some time together beforehand.” Or say something like, “I’ve been feeling a little cooped up lately and need to get out of the house. Want to join me for a run at the park after work?”"

Let’s just spend time together.” If they stop being charming and affectionate once sex is off the table, that’s a clear sign that they were mainly interested in hooking up, and don’t really care about your own well-being. [5] X Research source If they say that’s fine and settle in to simply hang out, that is great! But if they get cranky or leave, you have your answer."

Do they get on their phone or turn on the TV and stop interacting with you? You probably feel ignored or undervalued. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try engaging them in some other activity, like getting something to eat, going to the movies, or just talking to see if they’re interested in spending time together even after sex. Pay attention to how you feel you’re treated after sex. If you feel ignored or used, there is a reason for that. Chances are you’re not being unreasonable or dramatic—trust your intuition."

Send them a text about a work problem or a conflict with a friend and pay attention to what they say and how long it takes them to respond. Look for concern, compassion, or advice.

See if they offer to help you or do something to cheer you up. If they aren’t interested in seeing you or talking until you’re feeling better, that is a sign that they’re mainly interested in their own needs.

Arrange a hangout with their friends out at dinner or a bar, or invite them to spend time with your family or friends the next time you have plans together. Tell them it’d mean a lot to you. If they turn down the idea, that’s a red flag. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If they always come up with excuses or are busy when you want to see their friends or have them meet yours, pay attention to that.

[9] X Research source Sit your partner down, call them, or send them a text, and tell them honestly how you feel and why. Use “I” statements to avoid making them feel attacked. For example, say: “I feel like there’s not much to our relationship beyond sex, and I’m looking for something more than that. Is that something you want, too?” Or say, “Lately, it feels like we’re only having sex and not really connecting. What are you looking for in a relationship?”"

If they’re truly invested in you, they’ll make an effort to make the relationship more well-rounded, and to meet your needs. Or, if they’re all talk and no game, the relationship will still feel like it’s stuck, and you’ll still feel used. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It’s best to set clear goals and expectations that they can either pass or fail, like having a weekly date night that doesn’t end in sex, or putting their phone away in the bedroom."

Or do I want a relationship?” Ask yourself if you feel fulfilled and happy in this situation, and if you could keep living this way for the foreseeable future. If your partner changes after you tell them your concerns, then that’s a good sign. On the other hand, if things stay the same, it might be time to move on."

      "content": "Get some distance if you’re still feeling used. “If you want a relationship, you need to let go of someone that is just initiating a sexual connection with you and not investing in you in other ways,” Beck tells us. It’s not healthy for you to just let things keep going the way they are, and it’s not fair. Tell them you want to take a break to reevaluate, or end the relationship altogether. For example, say, “I don’t think this situation is healthy for me, and I’ve decided to take some time to myself. Maybe we can talk in a month to see how we feel.” Or, say: “I’ve decided that this isn’t working out, and I think we should see other people who want the same things we do.” If you do end things, take it easy for a while, and spend time doing things you like, like spending time with family and friends, to reconnect with your own wants and needs."
