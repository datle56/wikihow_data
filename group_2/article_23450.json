The more they feel like they are succeeding and the more reaction they get out of you, the more they will continue. Try to make your reactions as mild as possible. It may be really difficult, especially if what they are saying or doing is hurtful. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 28 October 2020. Before reacting, try slowly counting to 5 in your head. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, slowly breathing in and then out again. Focus as hard as you can on some object nearby. Focus your mind by thinking of as many qualities of the object as you can (size, color, function,etc.)."

You may suspect they're talking about you to their friends, but try to divert your attention somewhere else. Whatever they are saying is likely untrue and mean. If they are determined to act this way, there is little you are going to be able to say or do to stop them. Being silent is the best way to deal with rude people and you will be healthier for it.

Just act as if they are not there. Try replacing everything they say with the word \"blah\" or some other word, so that when they are talking all you hear is \"Blah blah blah, blah blah, blah.\" Imagine a soundproof wall between you and them. Or a soundproof box around you that keeps all the commentary out."

If you are in a situation like being on a bus, at work, or in a class, you won't have the ability to get very far away from the person, and walking away entirely is not a solid option. Just try and move as far away from the bully as you can. Move to the other side of the classroom, or the other end of the bus, and stay away from them. It will be easier to distract yourself and get back to what you were doing, and if you happen to be closer to an authority figure they may witness and intervene. If a bully is physically threatening you, immediately move towards an authority figure. If you are in a classroom move towards the teacher. If you are on a bus move towards the driver. You may be concerned about what the bully will think if you move towards an authority figure, but your safety comes first. You can just walk away if you don't feel like saying anything. If you feel like you have to say something, keep it short and simple like \"I don't have time for this.\""
