      "content": "Choose the type of cherry blossom tree you want. There are actually a variety of different cherry blossom trees available, each with different features. The Yoshino cherry tree grows quickly and has wide-spreading branches, while the Okame cherry tree has a rounded appearance and is a bit smaller. [1] X Research source The Kwanzan cherry tree is a tall tree that provides enough space to walk beneath it and admire it's bunches of blooms. There are also several kinds of weeping cherry trees, and you can choose one by size, if you have a specific spot to fill."

      "content": "Pick a spot with full sun to partial shade. In order to blossom, your cherry tree will need lots of sunlight, so choose a spot that gets at least four hours of direct sunlight per day. [2] X Research source If possible, choose a spot that is elevated compared to the rest of your lawn or garden to keep cold air from settling around your cherry tree. Cherry blossom trees grow best in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Select a space with deep, fertile soil. The soil beneath your cherry tree should be rich and deep. It's important that the soil is moist, but well-draining. Cherry trees can adapt to several soil types, but do better in acidic than alkaline environments."

      "content": "Procure a one- to two-year-old tree . Nurseries sell cherry blossom tree planting stock as young trees, rather than seeds. Choose a tree in the type you have selected that is one- to two-years-old and that has been grown in an environment similar to the one you plan to transfer the tree too (i.e. sun exposure, soil type)."

      "content": "Fertilize your tree after watering. Sprinkle all-purpose fertilizer around the roots of your cherry tree. Choose a granular kind, rather than a liquid, as it will slowly release nutrients into the soil that surrounds the roots of your tree. [10] X Research source To determine what type of fertilizer to use, pick up a soil test from any garden center. If your soil is deficient in any specific nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorus, or magnesium, choose a fertilizer that will add more of that nutrient. Otherwise, just use a 10-10-10 all-purpose fertilizer. [11] X Expert Source Matt Bowman Gardener & Owner, Tradition Market & Garden Expert Interview. 21 April 2020."
