      "title": "Learn about DID and its symptoms.",
      "content": "Learn about DID and its symptoms. Talk to your partner as well as professionals to get a better understanding of DID. People with DID often refer to themselves as a System, and may or may not be aware of all of their different alters. Their alters may or may not be aware of each other. With therapy, your partner might discover other alters. Here are some things you can ask to better understand what DID is like for them: [2] X Research source How many alters do you have? Can I meet all of your alters? Are all of your alters supportive? What roles do your alters play in your System? What does it feel like to switch? What can I do to help you?"

      "title": "Stay composed when another alter is in the front.",
      "content": "Stay composed when another alter is in the front. When an alter is in control of the body, it's said to be \"fronting.\" The alter that takes care of daily life is the one you might be most familiar with or consider your partner. [3] X Research source The others might be new and strange to you—they could be different genders, different ages, or have vastly different interests and ways of communicating. It can take some time to learn to love and accept all of your partner's alters. Ask your partner if they are willing or able to tell you when a different alter is fronting, but be willing to accept \"no\" as an answer. Remember that alters are often formed to cope with trauma and are extremely vulnerable. Some might front more willingly than others and your partner might have more sway with some alters than with others. Try to learn and understand the role each alter plays and when they're most likely to front. For example, your partner might have a protector or caretaker alter who fronts when they're frightened or feel threatened."

    {
      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. Your partner is dealing with an extremely challenging situation. To be diagnosed with DID, the person must be distressed by the disorder and the effects it has on their daily life. While you might find yourself at times frustrated or hurt by something they've done, remember that your partner (the alter you most identify as \"them\") isn't necessarily in control and might not know what's happening. If it gets too overwhelming and you are losing patience, try to excuse yourself from the conversation and take a break. Although it can be difficult to shorten a dissociative episode, one form of treatment is to intervene immediately following a traumatic event. So, if you can help the person overcome their trauma that might reduce symptoms of DID and speed up the process. That said, this generally needs to be done under the supervision of a qualified mental health professional.

      "title": "Show your partner empathy.",
      "content": "Show your partner empathy. Along with having patience, you must also have empathy. Your partner is experiencing a very scary situation. They will need as much love and support as you can possibly give them. Say kind things to them, listen to them when they want to talk about their situation, and show them that you care."

    {
      "title": "Discuss boundaries and consent with your partner's alters.",
      "content": "Discuss boundaries and consent with your partner's alters. Different alters might have different physical and emotional needs. They also might relate to you in different ways. Talk with your partner to better understand their alters and the issues you might face—but also keep in mind that these issues might change over time if new alters surface. [5] X Research source Alters might be children. If you have a sexual relationship with your partner, it's important not to engage in sexual activities while a child alter is fronting. If a child alter comes forward during sexual activities, stop immediately. You don't want to risk re-traumatizing the child. Alters can also be non-human. Because being a human is so complex and frightening for small children, they might develop animal alters as well. Animal alters will have far different needs than human alters, and you'll need to take care of them as well. Child alters frequently have a poor sense of boundaries and might need more \"rules\" than adult alters do. Be clear on what your partner wants help with and when."

      "title": "Avoid conflict and other stressful situations.",
      "content": "Avoid conflict and other stressful situations. Stress is the most common trigger of a switch or transition to a different alter fronting. [6] X Research source Conflict may be inevitable in any long-term relationship, but learn productive conflict-resolution skills that help decrease the stress and anxiety that can accompany an argument. If your partner does something that angers you, take some time alone to breathe and clear your mind. Get help if you have problems with anger management or difficulty controlling your emotions. If you lash out at your partner, your words or actions might be seen as a threat to the System. If you disagree with something that your partner said or is doing, use the “Yes, but…” technique. When they assert something that you do not agree with, say “yes, but…” so that you avoid directly conflicting with them."

      "content": "Support your partner with their treatment. Whether it is medication for other disorders that often co-occur with DID, such as depression or anxiety, or making sure that your partner goes to their appointments with their therapist, be there to help out. Talk to them about their goals with therapy and how their sessions are going. While some people with DID might have the ultimate goal of integrating their alters into one cohesive personality, a lot of them don't—and if your partner doesn't, you have to be okay with that. [7] X Research source Many people with DID seek a healthy multiplicity, in which all of their alters co-exist peacefully and manage their life and their body together. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Encourage your partner to develop healthy coping skills. Ultimately, your partner is responsible for their own self-care. You might say that the System is responsible for the System. They can learn different techniques by working with their therapist and talking to other people with DID. Here are some things they can try: [9] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source Journaling can help them get to know their alters. This is especially helpful for Systems whose parts don't have conscious connections. Grounding techniques, such as focusing on specific sensations or sniffing a strong aroma, can help them stay in the present and avoid intrusive thoughts or flashbacks. Physical exercise, a healthy diet, and plenty of sleep help them maintain their body and give them enough energy to cope with difficult thoughts or feelings when they come up. Talking to other people with DID can help them learn other coping strategies and ways to help manage their alters."

      "content": "Help your partner manage their time. While some people with DID can manage their own time and schedule activities for themselves, others won't be able to manage their time as well due to memory loss and different alters pulling their goal-directed behaviors in different directions. If your partner has a hard time keeping track of what they're supposed to be doing, help them along by reminding them of the activities they have planned. You might try creating a chart that you keep in a specific place they can easily see it. On the chart, write down important things they should be doing, as well as suggestions for other fun things to do."

      "content": "Keep track of your partner’s possessions if they ask you to. When your partner switches, memories from their other alters do not necessarily carry over. This can make it very hard to keep track of important items, such as their wallet or cell phone. Create an inventory of your partner's important items and place notes or stickies on or inside the items with your name and phone number on them. That way, anyone who finds your partner’s item can call you to return it.

      "content": "Monitor for self-harming tendencies. People with DID have almost always experienced abuse during childhood. Self-harming behaviors, such as suicidal thoughts, violence, substance abuse and risk-taking, are common in people who have DID. These behaviors tend to occur in those who have suffered abuse because they are used in an attempt to end their feelings of shame, horror, and fear spurred on by past abuse. If you notice that your partner has started developing self-harming behaviors, call their therapist immediately. If their life is in danger, call an ambulance."

You should take steps to maintain a healthy diet; it is also important to allow yourself some rest and relaxation time.
