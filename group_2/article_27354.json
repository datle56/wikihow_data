      "title": "Search for a curling iron that has plates or a clamp.",
      "content": "Search for a curling iron that has plates or a clamp. Any iron that has a rod or cone shape and looks like a wand won't effectively straighten your hair. Instead, opt for a traditional barrel-shaped iron that has plates, or a clamp, so that your hair can be pressed in between. This way, you’ll be able to use the curling iron as you would use a straightener."

      "title": "Look for a curling iron with a larger barrel.",
      "content": "Look for a curling iron with a larger barrel. It is much easier to straighten your hair with a curling iron that has a larger barrel, at least 1 to 2 inches in diameter. A larger barrel will allow you to run the curling iron through sections of your hair more easily and much more quickly than a curling iron with a smaller barrel. [1] X Research source If you only have access to a curling iron with a smaller barrel, .75 to 1 inch in diameter, you can still use it to straighten your hair. But it may take more time due to the smaller barrel size."

      "title": "Go for a ceramic curling iron.",
      "content": "Go for a ceramic curling iron. Look for a curling iron that is made of ceramic and/or tourmaline. Ceramic irons are ideal because they help to disperse heat through your hair more evenly. Tourmaline irons are also good for controlling frizz and for locking moisture in your hair when you style it with heat. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Many professional grade curling irons are made with ceramic or tourmaline. You may be able to get a more affordable curling iron that is only partly ceramic or tourmaline if you are on a budget."

      "title": "Make sure the curling iron has a variety of heat settings.",
      "content": "Make sure the curling iron has a variety of heat settings. You should also check that the curling iron comes with several heat settings so you can control how much heat you are applying to your hair. This will ensure you do not burn or damage your hair when you use the curling iron. [4] X Research source If you have fine hair or hair that is color treated, you should use a low heat setting of below 200 degrees. If you have curly, thick hair, you can use a higher heat setting of 200-300 degrees. Never go above 400 degrees as this can damage your hair, no matter what hair type you have. Make sure you pay attention to how your hair responds to the heat of the curling iron. If you notice a burning smell coming from your hair, the temperature may be too high. However, a burning smell can also indicate that your hair is dirty, wet, or even has too much product on it."

      "content": "Wash and condition your hair. You should prep your hair for the curling iron by washing and conditioning it in the shower. You should use a shampoo that will give your hair moisture and does not leave residue in your hair. [5] X Research source You should also use a small amount of conditioner on the ends of your hair so you do not put too much conditioner in your hair. Too much conditioner can make it more difficult for your hair to stay straight or hold any styles."
