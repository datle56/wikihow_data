      "content": "Apply a light layer of face oil. Using a bit of oil helps your fingers move smoothly across your face, rather than dragging on your skin. It also leaves your face bright and glowing when you're through with the massage. You may use a blend of oils formulated especially for the face, or choose a single oil that works best with your skin type. Almond, argan, and jojoba oil all work well as face massage oils that won't clog your pores. For very dry skin, choose argan or almond oil. For medium to oily skin, choose jojoba or a blend of jojoba and castor oil. If you're concerned about using oil on your skin, use your favorite moisturizer. If you want the oil to feel warm, keep the bottle of oil in warm water before you start your facial massage.
