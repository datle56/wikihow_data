      "title": "Purchase 1 pound (0.45 kg) of wool roving.",
      "content": "Purchase 1 pound (0.45 kg) of wool roving. Wool roving is wool fiber that has not been spun into yarn. It's usually sold in bags of about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of material. One bag is more than enough to make a full head of dreads. [1] X Research source You can buy pre-died wool if you find a color you like, or you can buy natural wool and dye it yourself. Merino wool is good for felting."

      "title": "Separate the wool roving into pieces the size you want your dreads.",
      "content": "Separate the wool roving into pieces the size you want your dreads. Wool roving is easy to pull apart with your hands. Pull the wool roving into pieces that are around 1/2 or 1/3 of the original width of the roving and as long as you want the finished dreads to be. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that the dreads will be slightly shorter and about half as wide at the end of the felting process. To make double-ended dreads, make the pieces of wool twice as long as you want the dreads to be. Double-ended dreads fold in the middle to create 2 locks out of 1 piece and are easier to attach to your head."

      "title": "Dip the wool roving in boiling hot, soapy water.",
      "content": "Dip the wool roving in boiling hot, soapy water. Wear gloves to protect your hands from the hot water. Fill a large pot with boiling water and add 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of soap. Any mild dish soap or detergent will do. Wet the wool roving fully in boiling hot water. [3] X Research source Wring out any extra water if the roving is dripping. The water needs to be as hot as possible for the felting process. If it starts to cool down throughout the process, re-boil it."

    {
      "title": "Roll the wet wool roving into shape with your hands.",
      "content": "Roll the wet wool roving into shape with your hands. Make sure to wear gloves so that you don't burn your hands. Starting with the thickest part of the wool in the center, start rolling the material back and forth on a countertop. Move up and down the wool to shape it into a dread. [4] X Research source Cover the countertop with a towel to absorb any water that will be released from the roving while you are rolling it. You may need several towels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Re-soak the wool and roll it again 3-4 times.",
      "content": "Re-soak the wool and roll it again 3-4 times. Repeat the soaking and rolling process until the wool is completely matted and looks like a dread. You can tell when the wool is fully dreaded when you can't pull the fibers apart anymore. [5] X Research source If you dunk the wool into water and it comes out in the same shape, it is done. If it starts to lose its shape in the water, it isn't done yet."

    {
      "title": "Dry the wool dreads out completely.",
      "content": "Dry the wool dreads out completely. Hang the dreads on a hanger or drying rack until they are completely dry. Put a towel underneath the dreads to catch any dripping water. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you can put the dreads into a dryer on a low heat and check them every 5 minutes until they are dry."

      "title": "Bring a mixture of dye, vinegar, and water to a boil on the stovetop.",
      "content": "Bring a mixture of dye, vinegar, and water to a boil on the stovetop. You can use food dye or acid dye to color wool dreads if you used natural wool roving and want a more vibrant color for your dreads. Add about 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL) of dye and 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL) of white vinegar to a large pot. Fill the rest of the pot with water. [7] X Research source Once the mixture boils, turn the heat down so that it stays at a simmer. Use a stainless steel or enamel pot."

      "content": "Sink the dreads completely into the dye bath. Wear gloves to protect your hands from burns or dye. Lower the dreads gently into the hot dye bath. [8] X Research source Alternatively, you can use tongs to lower the dreads into the dye bath."

      "title": "Let the dreads soak for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the dreads soak for 30 minutes. Leave the dreads to soak in the dye bath for around 30 minutes to absorb the dye, stirring them from time to time. Don't let the water boil, or the dreads might start to stick together. Once the water in the dye bath looks clear, the wool has absorbed all of the dye. [9] X Research source To get an ombre effect, use a rubber band to tie off the section of the dreads you want to dye. Dip the dreads in the dye bath up to the rubber band. Then, repeat the process with another color on the other side of the dreads. If you don't want to hold the dreads in place the whole time, pour out some of the dye bath so that it comes up to the rubber band and you can lean the dreads against the side of the pot. Disposable chop sticks are good for stirring dye baths."

      "title": "Add more dye to the bath to make a more vibrant color.",
      "content": "Add more dye to the bath to make a more vibrant color. If the color of the dreads isn't quite bright enough and there isn't much dye left in the water, add a little bit more dye at a time to get the color you want. Leave the dreads in the bath until they have soaked up most of the extra dye. Keep in mind that wool can only absorb a limited amount of dye, so you may not be able to get the exact color you were envisioning. [10] X Research source Remember that the dreads will dry in a lighter color than what you see in the pot."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the dreads in cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the dreads in cold water. Once the dreads are the color you want them, rinse them in cold, running water to get rid of any excess dye. Once the water runs clear, the dreads are ready to dry. [11] X Research source Using cold water to rinse helps preserve the color of the dye."

      "title": "Braid double-ended dreads with your natural hair.",
      "content": "Braid double-ended dreads with your natural hair. To braid double-ended braids into your own hair, start with a piece of hair around the same width as the dread. Fold the dread in half, with your hair in the middle. Braid the dread with the piece of hair for at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) and then tie off the braid with a small rubber hair tie. [12] X Research source You need at least 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) of natural hair to be able to braid in dreads."

      "content": "Use a loop to braid in single-ended dreads. Make a loop at the root of a single-ended dread by folding around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the dread and securing the loop with a rubber band. Pull an equal width of hair through the loop. Then, split the hair into 2 sections and braid it with the dread. Secure the ends of the braids with rubber bands to keep them in place. [13] X Research source Use elastic bands that are close to your natural hair color or the color of the dreads if you want them to blend in. Use bright colors for a fun look."

      "content": "Attach many dreads to a single base dread to make a dread fall. Wrap about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of a single-ended dread around the dread you are using as a base and secure it in place with a rubber band. Repeat the process with as many dreads as you like. Then, create a high bun or ponytail with your natural hair. Wrap the base dread around the base of the bun and secure it using bobby pins. [14] X Research source This style won't hide all of your natural hair, but is a quick way to attach a lot of dreads to your head."
