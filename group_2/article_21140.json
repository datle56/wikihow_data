      "title": "Become self-aware",
      "content": "Become self-aware . You are a complex human being who is faced with many complex experiences daily. Because of this, you may forget to focus on your inner-self, and pay attention to how your words and behaviors not only affect you, but others as well. Becoming more self-aware of your current personality traits and how they affect you and others will help you to identify areas you may want to change. The primary areas of self-awareness include: personality traits, values, morals, and beliefs, habits, emotional and psychological needs. Self-awareness of your personality can help you navigate your world better by gravitating towards situations that provide you with positive experiences and rewards, and avoid those situations that can be destructive and cause you too much stress. In other words, self-awareness of your personality will help you analyze how you react and feel about things to help you make better choices in life."

      "title": "Make a list of personality traits you want to develop or strengthen.",
      "content": "Make a list of personality traits you want to develop or strengthen. These can be traits you already possess to some degree. They can also be traits you don’t currently have, but wish you did. [1] X Research source For instance, you might be a naturally shy person who wants to become more outgoing. If you’re already a creative person, you could decide to work on applying your creativity in more areas of your life. Don’t work on too many personality traits at once. Choose just one or two at first, so you don’t get overwhelmed."

      "title": "Jot down some habits you want to minimize.",
      "content": "Jot down some habits you want to minimize. If you have any qualities that you don’t like, write them down. Traits that bother you or make your life more difficult are good candidates for this list. For instance, if you have a tendency to interrupt people, you might decide you want to break that habit."

      "title": "Go from small to big.",
      "content": "Go from small to big. Personality traits are constructs that make up who you are as a person. These traits are further broken down into daily habits. Keep in mind that your habit change should involve the overarching personality traits that influence negative habits. For example, you might dislike your habit to disrupt people. This habit aligns with the personality trait of self-centeredness. Such a trait may show up in other habits like throwing tantrums when you don't get your way or gossiping. Look closely at your habits to find the bigger trait. Then, try to identify other similar habits indicated by that trait."

      "title": "Create a plan.",
      "content": "Create a plan. Look over your lists and think about how you can make them a reality. Make a new list of specific actions you can take to improve your personality. Make sure your actions are focused around everyday situations you deal with frequently."

      "title": "Put new actions into practice.",
      "content": "Put new actions into practice. After you have devised a list of feasible actions, start implementing them into your everyday life. New habits are developed by replacing the negative ones with more positive, adaptive choices. Add in more positive habits, and you'll gradually extinguish the old. For instance, if you’re trying to become more punctual, you could commit to leaving for work every morning five minutes earlier than you currently do."

    {
      "title": "Be attentive to your needs",
      "content": "Be attentive to your needs . Just as Maslow discussed in his hierarchy of needs, humans have a variety of psychological needs that determine their behaviors and how they may react or respond in various situations. These are needs such as: power and control, belongingness, affection or love, esteem, achievement, and self-actualization. Becoming aware and attentive to your needs and how they affect your behaviors will help you with understanding how this affects your interpersonal relationships. Your needs drive your motivation. If your needs are not being met, you may experience a decrease in motivation, become more frustrated, and have more conflict and stress in your life."

      "title": "Adopt a positive mindset.",
      "content": "Adopt a positive mindset. Positivity is an essential trait for a well-groomed personality. To become more positive, get into the habit of looking for the good in people and situations, instead of finding reasons to criticize them. When things go wrong, focus on the things you can change, instead of the things you can’t. [2] X Research source A positive mindset will attract people to you, while a negative one will repel them. Having a positive mindset doesn’t mean you have to be happy all the time or enjoy bad situations. Rather, it means looking for the silver lining and doing what you can to improve things."

      "title": "Develop your interests and hobbies.",
      "content": "Develop your interests and hobbies. Maintain a balanced personality by exploring a variety of interests and activities. If you already have hobbies, set aside some time daily or weekly to work on them. If you think your personality could use some rounding out, teach yourself a hobby or two you’ve always wanted to learn, or look for a class or a club you can join. For instance, if you’ve been spending most of your time and energy on work, try taking a cooking class or a dance class to improve your work-life balance. Classes, clubs, and groups are a great way to meet new people while you expand your horizons."

      "title": "Have a purpose.",
      "content": "Have a purpose. Most people with strong, appealing personalities have some kind of mission in life. Think about what you want to achieve, and then set goals that will help you get there. Avoid squandering your time on things that don’t really matter to you. [3] X Research source Your life goals don’t have to be big and grand, as long as they’re meaningful to you."

      "title": "Learn as much as you can.",
      "content": "Learn as much as you can. Staying well-informed is an important aspect of grooming your personality.

[4] X Research source If you’re not happy with the way you present yourself, invest in something that will make you feel more confident, such as some flattering clothes or a good haircut.

The type of therapy usually used in such settings is dialectical behavioral therapy (talk therapy) and mindfulness training.
