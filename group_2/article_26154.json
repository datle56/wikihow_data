      "content": "Load large, heavy dishes on the bottom and light, fragile dishes on the top. The diagram above shows the correct way to load your dishwasher so that all your dishes come out clean and intact. The bottom rack is tall and wide with plenty of room for bigger, bulkier items like dinner plates, stainless steel pots and pans, and cutting boards — not to mention a utensil holder for flatware. The top rack is set high above the spray arms so the water pressure from the jets doesn't damage lighter, more delicate dishes like glasses, bowls, and plastic containers. [1] X Research source Read the manufacturer's label on the bottom of every dish (or the package it came in) before loading it in the dishwasher to verify that it's dishwasher-safe. If it's not, handwash it in the sink. The spray arms in the dishwasher distribute water throughout the inside of the tub during a clean cycle. Most standard dishwashers come with a spray arm underneath the bottom rack and a second one underneath the top rack."

      "title": "Set cups and glasses upside down on the sides of the top rack.",
      "content": "Set cups and glasses upside down on the sides of the top rack. Loading these dishes upside-down is crucial if you want the water and detergent to get inside where they're dirtiest. It also helps the water drain out at the end of the cleaning cycle. Place them in between the tines so the tines don't leave water spots or cause cracks. [2] X Research source Some dishwashers come with a plastic, mesh-like piece that folds up and down on the top rack and is designed to hold wine glass stems. If your dishwasher has this feature, use it to protect these more fragile pieces from getting scratched or cracked. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Load small bowls and plates between the tines, angled downward.",
      "content": "Load small bowls and plates between the tines, angled downward. This ensures the water from the spray arms can splash on the inside and top of these dishes to properly clean them. It also helps the water drain out so they dry faster. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Place plastic containers and other plastic items on the top rack.",
      "content": "Place plastic containers and other plastic items on the top rack. Because the heating element in most dishwashers is on the bottom, placing plastic items in the bottom rack could cause them to melt or warp. Position the lids sideways in the same way you would arrange a small plate. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay long cooking utensils flat across the top rack.",
      "content": "Lay long cooking utensils flat across the top rack. Arrange your long, large utensils like ladles, serving spoons, and spatulas flat in between the tines on the top rack. The bottom rack in your dishwasher probably has a utensil holder, but that's mostly for forks, knives, spoons, and other small items. Laying them down in the bottom rack also isn't ideal because they take up valuable space and might cover the spray arms. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert plates upright into the slots in the bottom rack.",
      "content": "Insert plates upright into the slots in the bottom rack. Face them toward the center and, if they lean at all, lean them inwards and downwards toward the spray arms below. This helps expose as much of their dirty surface as possible to the soap and water. Try to keep all surfaces separated and accessible to the streams of water from the sprayers."

    {
      "title": "Angle large bowls and stainless steel pots and pans dirty side downward.",
      "content": "Angle large bowls and stainless steel pots and pans dirty side downward. Only wash pots and pans in the dishwasher if they're made of stainless steel, glass, anodized aluminum, Teflon, or ceramic (with no hand-painted designs). When in doubt, just look at the bottom to see if it's labeled \"dishwasher safe.\" Handwash your hand-painted ceramic, cast iron, copper, non-anodized aluminum, and nonstick cookware, as cleaning these materials in the dishwasher can cause them to chip, rust, scratch, and corrode. [7] X Research source Point the handles away from the spray arms so they don't obstruct them. If necessary, handwash large items or run two or more dishwasher loads to get all your dishes clean."

      "content": "Load cutlery in the basket with the handles down (except for knives). Place your forks and spoons in the cutlery basket on the bottom rack with their handles down. However, you should set your knives in blades down so you don't accidentally cut yourself when loading and unloading the dishwasher. If you don't have a cutlery basket, alternate between loading the forks and spoons with their handles down and handles up to prevent nesting. (Nesting is when the utensils stack up against one another, preventing them from getting cleaned.) [8] X Research source Separate stainless steel and silver or silver-plated utensils in the basket. If you don't, they might react during the cycle and cause damage to the silver. [9] X Research source Avoid washing wooden utensils or any other wooden dishes in the dishwasher."

It's usually shallower than the other two and is designed to hold small glasses and bowls, cooking utensils, or plastic containers and lids. It's especially useful when you have a lot of different types of dishes to wash and want to maximize your dishwasher space. [11] X Research source Most dishwasher models have 2 racks only."

When wood is exposed to too much heat, moisture, and detergent, it becomes stripped of its natural oils and becomes dry and brittle. [14] X Research source The exception is if the wood utensil or dish has a \"dishwasher safe\" label on it, in which case you can feel free to load it with the rest of your items!"

Remove things like bones, corncobs, seeds, and peelings, etc. [15] X Research source While you don't want to wash your dishes, wiping off with a dirty fork or napkin will lead to much better results later. Avoid pre-rinsing your dishes before sticking them in the dishwasher unless it's going to be a while before you can start a load. It's a waste of water since your dishwasher detergent should be able to remove any remaining stuck-on food without a problem. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Arrange dishes so the spray arms and detergent dispenser aren’t blocked. Spin the spray arms to check that they don’t hit anything. Additionally, follow cleaning expert Regina Decorte's advice and check that the detergent dispenser on the door can open fully (i.e., it isn't blocked by a “pot handle, utensil, etc.”). If either of these components is prevented from moving or opening, your dishes won't get a good wash. Some dishwasher models only have spray arms under the bottom rack, not the top rack. If your dishwasher isn't cleaning the inside of your glasses and other items on the top rack, remove any large bowls or pots in the bottom rack that might be blocking the water from spraying up above."

      "content": "Avoid overcrowding the dishwasher racks. If you load your dishwasher with too many dishes at once by stacking and nesting them, there's a good chance they won't all come out clean. There's also an increased risk that the dishes will block the spray arms and soap dispenser. Ensure you can move the racks in and out of the appliance easily, even when fully loaded, and that every dish is separated from its neighbor. If not, remove some dishes and either save them for a second load or handwash them in the sink. [17] X Research source Additionally, arrange all the dishes between the tines rather than over them (if possible) to prevent water spots and cracks."

The rinse aid may not need to be refilled every time you use the dishwasher , but remember to top it off every couple of weeks to a month (or according to the instructions on the bottle). [18] X Research source Some dishwasher detergents have a rinse aid in them already, so read the label before you buy another product."

      "title": "Clean your dishwasher filter regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your dishwasher filter regularly. Every dishwasher has a filter that catches food and detergent so they don't circulate back into the water. Cleaning expert Chris Willatt recommends washing this filter out once a month so it doesn't become clogged with mineral deposits from the water. He suggests filling the bottom of the tub ¼ inch (0.6 cm) deep with white vinegar and then running a regular cycle, as this will dissolve the deposits and clean the filter. Vinegar helps dissolve calcium and other mineral deposits from hard water. If the drain at the bottom of the dishwasher becomes clogged, Willatt says to “hit it with a scrub brush and dish soap” to clear it out."
