      "content": "Add water only if the crust is hard. Even stale bread still contains plenty of water. It feels dry because the starch molecules have linked up and trapped the water. This means you don't need to add water to the crumb of the bread. If the bread has a hard outer crust, flick water onto it, or run it under the cold tap if extremely stale. [2] X Research source If the bread turned dry from overheating, or if it was exposed to air, it has lost some of its water. [3] X Research source Wet the whole loaf to restore moisture."

      "content": "Bring water to a boil in the base of a steamer. Pour a shallow layer of water into the pan. Heat over high until the water reaches a rolling boil, then remove from heat. If you don't have a steamer, you'll need a colander that sits on top of the pan, and a lid that can fit over the colander. This methods adds less heat than the oven, but more moisture. The extra moisture is most helpful when the bread is very stale and hard, or if it was left out unwrapped."

[8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is the fastest method, but it's best to save it for an immediate snack. This happens because the microwave boils away some of the water. The escaping steam pushes the starches into a denser structure, and leaves the bread dry. Slow heating in small increments can reduce this effect, but it's difficult to find a sweet spot that's still hot enough to soften the bread."
