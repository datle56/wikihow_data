If you’re thinking about walking away to get him to chase you or change his behavior, try having an honest conversation first. Being direct is the best way to get your relationship back on track. Tell him how you’re feeling and what you want from him in a respectful, calm way. [10] X Research source Try saying something like, “Sometimes I feel taken for granted in this relationship. I’d really love it if you could make it a point to show your appreciation for all I do for us. Just saying “thank you” would mean a lot to me.” Alternatively, you might say, “I don’t always feel like a priority to you. Could we set aside a few nights a week where we spend quality time together without being on our phones?” Give him a chance to respond to what you said and let you know what he needs out of the relationship as well. If you’re both willing to make some changes to meet each other’s needs, you can make things work."

If this guy isn’t doing that, then it’s time to say goodbye.

Don’t get discouraged if things didn’t work out. Staying in a bad relationship, you can miss the chance to build a good one. Moving on allows you to find someone that is a better match for you."
