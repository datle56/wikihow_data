      "content": "Study how a current travels through a circuit. An electrical current consists of electrons, the negatively charged particles in atoms. In a current, the electrons flow from a negative source, such as a battery terminal. Then, they flow through a conductor, such as a wire, and return to the positive terminal. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn how to control the flow of current through a circuit.",
      "content": "Learn how to control the flow of current through a circuit. Four main concepts determine how current flows through a circuit. They are voltage, amperage, resistance, and wattage. Voltage: Voltage measures the force needed to make a current flow through a circuit. In a circuit, the electrons accumulate near the battery’s negative terminal. Energy is required to get the current to flow through the circuit, and this measurement is the voltage. Amperage: Amperage is the rate at which electricity flows through a circuit. The higher the amperage (or amps), the more electrons can flow through the circuit. \"The best way to think of [voltage and amperage],\" says Kuhlman, is to think of a water hose. The voltage is the water pressure, and the amperage is the size of the hose. The larger the hose, the more amperage could be there. [4] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. Resistance: As current flows through a circuit, different electric components and even wires add resistance to the current, slowing it down. Going with Kuhlman's water hose analogy, resistance would be like kinking the hose or adding a nozzle that restricts the water flow. Resistance is measured in Ohms (Ω). Wattage: Wattage (watts) is the total amount of electricity a device consumes. Different electronic devices consume different amounts of electricity. A light bulb can consume between 40 to 100 watts. A vacuum cleaner can consume between 400 to 900 watts. You can find out how much wattage a device consumes by multiplying the voltage by the amperage."

      "content": "Read circuit diagrams to understand the notation. Electrical diagrams and schematics use symbols to denote components. Before you can copy one to build your circuit, find out what the symbols mean. Search online for a list of symbols used as shorthand in diagrams. [5] X Research source The straight lines are wires. A battery is represented by a + sign followed by a long and short straight line. Diodes, for example, are represented by triangles. Resistors are represented by squares or jagged lines."

It’s helpful to have one on hand to test the current in any electrical circuit. Get one that measures the current, voltage, and resistance. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Add resistance to a current using a resistor.",
      "content": "Add resistance to a current using a resistor. Resistors are small tubes on wires. They don’t actively do anything but are important in limiting the electrical current. Without a resistor, the electrical current can become too strong and ruin other components. [7] X Research source For example, attaching an LED to a circuit may burn out if the voltage is too strong. Adding a resistor before the LED can reduce the voltage flowing through the LED. You can usually identify how much resistance a resistor adds to the circuit by the color-coded bands or number code printed on the resistor."

    {
      "title": "Store electricity with a capacitor.",
      "content": "Store electricity with a capacitor. Capacitors are the opposite of resistors. Instead of limiting the flow, they encourage it by storing a little bit of electricity. This way, if the power is disrupted, the circuit continues to work. Using the water hose analogy again, a capacitor is like a water tank. When a water tank is full, water will continue to flow, even if you cut the water flow going into the tank, at least until the tank is empty. Capacitors can be used to temporarily store energy, smooth out voltage spikes and interruptions, as well as for timing. For example, if you unplug your computer, the capacitors will ensure the electrical current runs smoothly from the battery. Capacitors are often used in clocks and timers because the rate at which they charge and discharge is consistent time. [8] X Research source Capacitors come in a variety of sizes. The marking on the side of the capacitor indicates the voltage a capacitor can handle and the capacitance. Capacitance is measured in farads (F) or microfarads (μF). Warning: Capacitors can discharge electricity, causing electric shock. Always handle capacitors with care and never touch the metal terminals. Warning: If you apply more voltage than the capacitor can handle, the capacitor will explode."

      "title": "Control electrical currents using diodes and transistors.",
      "content": "Control electrical currents using diodes and transistors. These components have + and - terminals that help conduct electricity. When activated, electricity flows through one end and out the other. Diodes have two ends, while transistors have three. Diodes are used to make an electrical current flow in one direction only. Diodes have a role to play in converting AC electricity into DC, extracting audio signals from radio waves, and converting sunlight into electricity in a solar panel. [9] X Research source Transistors are like switches that change the direction of a current. Transistors can be used to create logic gates, which compare multiple input signals to create a different output signal. This is the basis of modern computing. A modern computer CPU has millions or even billions of microscopic transistors. Transistors are also used in amplification. For example, in an FM radio, transistors can convert a weak radio signal into a signal strong enough to output to a speaker."

      "content": "Practice cutting and stripping wires. For basic electrical work, you will need a wire cutter and a wire stripper from a hardware store. To do this, cut the wires to the length first. Then, strip about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of insulation off the ends before connecting them to components. To work with the wire, hold the exposed ends against the components or tape them in place. If you use a breadboard, simply push the exposed end into the hole. When you first begin, you do not need to learn how to solder."

Always connect like wires together. Use black and red wires to power your circuits. [10] X Research source Black wires are the main current conductors in a circuit. Red wires are secondary carriers. Blue and yellow wires are uncommon but are used to carry electricity in complex circuits. White and gray wires are considered neutral because they conduct unused electricity. Green wires are grounding wires which bring the current to the ground for safety."
