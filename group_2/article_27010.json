If you're using cheesecloth, pick it up and squeeze out the extra milk before discarding the solid coconut. [2] X Research source"

Hold it in place with one hand, and use a butcher knife to make cuts in a circular shape around its eye. The easiest way to do this is to strike the coconut, as you would with a machete, in the same place until a deep enough cut is made. Continue to do this until you've cut a circular lid that can be lifted away from the coconut. Use a very sharp knife to do this job. A blunt knife could slip and cut your hand. Another method for opening a coconut is to wrap the coconut in a kitchen towel and set it on a hard surface. Use a rolling pin or a hammer to strike the coconut in the middle, so that it cracks in half. If you use this method, drill a hole in the coconut first, drain out the coconut water, and set it aside.
