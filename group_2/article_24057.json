[2] X Research source Expect to pay anywhere between $250-500 for your building permits. If your roof is bigger than 1,000 square feet (93 m 2 ), you will likely to need to pay more and file for additional permits. In most areas, you don’t need a permit to replace a single shingle or something like that, but you almost always need a permit to install an entirely new roof."

      "content": "Measure the size of your roof. If possible, pull up the architectural plans for your home to make this easy. These plans will give you all of the measurements you need. If you don’t have those, you’ll need to get up on the roof and measure it yourself. For each portion of the roof, multiply the length and width together to find the area. Add your areas together. This will tell you how much roofing material you’ll need to order. [3] X Research source For a pitched roof, this is going to be exceptionally challenging. You may be better off simply estimating the size of each section and then ordering a little extra so that you have plenty of material to cover the entire roof. It is highly recommended that you don’t install roofing on a gable roof on your own, though."

Shingles are the most popular option out there because they’re the easiest to install and replace . [4] X Research source EPDM rubber roofing is going to be your all around best bet for a DIY job on a flat roof. Unlike the other options for a flat roof, EPDM membrane comes in really big sheets so you don’t need to worry as much about fixing the seams. [5] X Research source If you have a pitched roof, shingles are likely the best option. You can install EPDM on a pitched roof, but it won’t look particularly good. Metal, slate, ceramic, concrete, PVC, and TPO are all semi-popular roofing options, but they require specialized tools and they’re too complex to install on your own without a professional crew."

The instructions will come with the system you buy, but it generally involves installing an anchor in the roof, and then attaching a reinforced lifeline to a harness. Without one of these, you cannot work on the roof. If you don’t have direct roof access, you’ll also need a reinforced ladder and someone to hold it. [7] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source If you’ve got a flat roof with a railing or barrier, you can reasonably install the roofing materials without any extra safety steps. Do not work on your roof when it’s dark out, if it’s windy, or if there’s any chance of rain. It’s not safe to do any work in unstable conditions."

If you need to install new overhangs, hold the drip edge up flush along the edge of the roof so that it’s flush with the roof. Place hash marks using a pencil on the ends of the edge and use a chalk line to snap a straight line between the two points. [8] X Research source If your roof is really big, you may need 2-3 people to help you out on this one. You can cut the flashing using tin snips or a hand saw if you want to split the drip edge into smaller pieces that are easier to work with. If you can’t reach the edge of the roof with a ladder, hire someone to do this. It isn’t safe to lean over the side of the building and do this upside down. Drip edge flashing is the small strip of wood, metal, or plastic that runs along the rim of the house so that water spills out over the overhang."

Working slowly and carefully, nail the paper into place by driving 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches (3.2 cm) roofing nails into the wood below. [10] X Research source For most climates, you want to use 30 pounds (14 kg) roofing paper. Cut the roofing paper with a utility knife if you need to fit it around any pipes, chimneys, or other obstructions. It doesn’t need to be absolutely perfect, but you do want most of the roof covered."

Set the first shingle down so it hangs out 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) over the drip edge. Check to see that it’s even with a spirit level and use your chalk line to mark a horizontal row. Drive a roofing nail through the flat portion of the shingle at the top, and install a single row around the entire roof. [11] X Research source If you have 3-tab shingles, there’s typically a “starter” set that goes down first. These shingles are slightly easier to install since they fold together really cleanly, but you do need to use the starter shingle first."

Once it’s level, snap your chalk line and repeat the process by nailing the shingles into the roof. [12] X Research source Position the shingles so that the vertical grooves between the individual shingles rest in the center of the row above it. This pyramid-style layering is the safest way to protect the shingles and the roof from water. If your shingles are bigger than the traditional asphalt shingles, just try to split the difference when it comes to how much overlap there is between the columns. So long as you’re consistent and the top portion of each shingle is covered, it should be fine. [13] X Research source"

Install the flashing by laying it over the edge and around the pipes, and nail it into place. Lay exterior silicone caulk around the seams to protect them from water. [14] X Research source Flashing is fairly easy to work with, but you do want to make sure the angles and edges are as flush as possible."

Wait at least 20 minutes for the membrane sheets to relax. This will give them time to adjust to the environment, which is essential if you want to avoid wrinkles, stretches, or sags. [16] X Research source If you attach the sheets to the roof before they’ve had time to acclimate to the environment, they may shift, shrink, or stretch after the glue cures. This can reduce the level of protection over time."

There should be at least 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) of overhang, and if you’re using multiple sheets, layer the seams on top of one another so that there’s a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) overlap. [17] X Research source To join the seams when it comes time, use a brush to spread the adhesive along the overlap, apply splicing tape over the adhesive, and remove the cover of the splice tape. Smooth it out by hand with a roller. [18] X Research source You’re going to lift the sheets up, but you can’t start the installation process if they aren’t lined up where you want them first."

Start on the section of the roof that’s furthest from the middle of the sheet, and apply the adhesive to the roof while leaving at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) open around the rim of the roof. [21] X Research source Apply adhesive to the underside of the membrane as well. Wait a few minutes for the adhesive to cure a bit.

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to glue the edges down. [24] X Research source Take extra care to roll the roof so that you force down any air bubbles, wrinkles, or blemishes. Once the adhesive cures, you won’t be able to move the membrane around, so you have to smooth everything down now.

Pinch the sheets in place, and slide the corner cap for your trim flashing over the corner to hold it in place. Repeat this process on the other corners and finish by installing the rest of your flashing. [26] X Research source You don’t need to glue the overhang in place. The flashing should hold the membrane in place once it is installed. Fill in any gaps between the flashing and the roof with exterior silicone sealant."

Once you find a well-reviewed contractor who can handle the job, ask them what you need to do to move forward. [27] X Research source In most cases, so long as you hire a licensed contractor, you don’t need to file for permits yourself; the contractor will handle this stuff for you or walk you through it step by step. Before you pull the trigger, ask how long they’ve been in business and request a copy of their contractor’s license. Also, ask them what kind of material they suggest for your roof. Different buildings and climates call for different kinds of roofing solutions, so talk it over with them. [28] X Research source"

The cost of a new roof will vary dramatically depending on the size of the roof, the shape of your roof, and the material you choose. Generally speaking, you should expect to spend anywhere from $7,000 to 12,000 on the materials and installation. [29] X Research source Asphalt shingles tend to be the cheapest, and it’s fairly easy to replace a few shingles in the future if your roof ever get damaged. These roofs aren’t the most durable, though. Membrane roofs (i.e. rubber or vinyl roofing) are more expensive, but these roofs tend to last very long and they’re less labor intensive to install. Metal roofing is very expensive but it can last a very long time. Other options include slate, ceramic tile, and concrete. These materials are all extremely durable."
