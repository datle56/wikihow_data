The factors that lead to high levels of bilirubin can be hereditary, environmental, or related to other health conditions. Babies born prematurely are less likely to be able to process bilirubin because their livers are not sufficiently developed. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Babies whose blood type is incompatible with the mother's type -- known as ABO Incompatibility -- may be born with higher levels of bilirubin in their blood. If the baby is significantly bruised during birth, the breakdown of red blood cells may increase bilirubin levels. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Babies can develop \"breast milk jaundice\" for two reasons: the presence of certain proteins in the mother's milk, or the baby not receiving enough milk, which leads to dehydration. [7] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Some babies can have liver, blood or enzyme problems or other medical problems that can lead to elevated bilirubin.

[9] X Research source Since latching and sucking problems can cause the infant to receive less breast milk, consider enlisting the aid of a lactation consultant who is trained to help mothers feed their babies. [10] X Research source Feeding the baby more often will encourage bowel movements, which eliminate bilirubin. [11] X Research source If increased breastfeeding does not reduce bilirubin levels, your pediatrician may direct you to supplement the baby's diet with formula or expressed breast milk.

      "content": "Ask your pediatrician about phototherapy. Phototherapy involves exposing the infant to light in the blue-green spectrum. The light waves pass through the baby's body and into the blood, where it converts the bilirubin into materials that the baby's body will be able to excrete. [13] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source The baby will wear soft eye patches to protect their eyes from the light. They are also able to wear a diaper during the therapy. The baby will likely have loose, frequent, and possibly greenish bowel movements as a side effect of phototherapy. This is normal and should end when the treatments have stopped.

      "content": "Assess your health to identify conditions that can elevate bilirubin levels in adults. The bilirubin production system can run into trouble at one of three points: before, during, and after bilirubin production. Each of these problems can result from a set of related conditions: Adults can develop what is called \"unconjugated jaundice\" when the problem occurs before bilirubin is produced. This is most often caused by reabsorption of a large blood clot or by hemolytic anemia. During the production of bilirubin, adults can develop jaundice as a result of viruses such as hepatitis and Epstein-Barr, autoimmune disorders, and overconsumption of alcohol or certain medications including acetaminophen, oral contraceptives, and steroids. If the adult develops jaundice because of problems after bilirubin production, the problem may lie in the gallbladder or pancreas."

Usually, your doctor will work to find and treat the cause of your jaundice and treat any complications of the jaundice. The jaundice itself is not usually treated. Sometimes a medication may be given to help with itching, which is a common symptom of jaundice. [19] X Research source Jaundice is often accompanied by other symptoms, which may help your doctor determine the cause: Short term jaundice, which is caused by infection, may be accompanied by chills, fever, abdominal discomfort, or other flu-like symptoms. Jaundice caused by cholestasis -- the interruption of the flow of bile -- may be accompanied by itching, weight loss, darkened urine, or lightened stools. [20] X Research source"

A number of uncommon medical disorders can lead to elevated bilirubin and jaundice. Gilbert syndrome is a genetic liver disorder. Patients have a reduced amount of the liver enzyme needed to break down bilirubin. Although present from birth, symptoms, which include jaundice, fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal discomfort, may not appear until young adulthood. [21] X Research source Crigler-Najjar disease is an extremely rare condition that is also caused by an enzyme deficiency. There are two types of this disease; the more common one, called Arias' syndrome, can be treated so that patients can live a normal or near-normal lifespan.

Alcohol can damage the liver, which leads to increased bilirubin levels, so limit your consumption to the recommended daily allowance (1-2 drinks per day depending on your age). Some people may be advised to completely eliminate alcohol consumption. Alcohol can damage the liver in three ways: By leaving excess fat in liver cells. This condition is known as fatty liver disease. Many people who have this condition do not experience symptoms, but those who do may experience discomfort and fatigue. [23] X Research source By causing scarring and inflammation of the liver. These symptoms may indicate alcoholic hepatitis. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. Alcoholic hepatitis can sometimes be reversed by abstaining from alcohol. [24] X Research source This can also be caused by viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis.

Certain foods are more likely to damage the liver, including those high in fat, sugar, or salt. Other foods that may damage the liver include fried food and raw or undercooked shellfish."
