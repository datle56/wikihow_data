      "content": "Fighting with your partner is normal—it's a sign of a healthy relationship. If you’re a little nervous about the fact that you’re fighting with your partner, let out a sigh of relief. No two human beings think or behave in a way that is perfectly identical. It’s totally normal for there to be friction from time to time, and you shouldn’t automatically take conflict with your partner as a sign that something is wrong. As Brown says, “healthy relationships are enriched by conflict.” [1] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. Healthy arguments can actually strengthen your relationship, as seen in the following research-backed benefits: [2] X Research source Fighting reasserts each person’s independence. If the two of you agreed on everything all the time, you’d lose your sense of self. As Brown explains, the occasional conflict reminds each of you that you’re different people and might help stimulate conversations, ideas, and a deeper understanding of your partner. [3] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. Arguments can reestablish where boundaries exist. Fighting can signal what is and is not permissible, and that’s an essential part of any healthy relationship. Smaller arguments help you practice for serious conflict in the future. Arguing over “smaller” stuff prepares you for the really tough stuff you might face if you get married or stay together for years. Arguments can strengthen your bond. As weird as it sounds, the makeup portion of an argument actually brings you closer to your partner."

      "content": "If you’re fighting every day over minor issues, there may be a problem. It’s normal to fight every day if you’re negotiating a complex problem, like a large debt, addiction, or infidelity. So long as your arguments are calm and productive, and the fighting doesn’t go on for months, it’s not the end of the world. [4] X Research source However, something is wrong if you’re in a volatile relationship where you’re shouting at one another over seemingly unimportant stuff every day. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This type of recurring conflict often happens when an underlying problem is going unaddressed. Take a step back and sit down with your partner. Try to have a calm, respectful conversation about what’s really going on here. If that doesn’t work, see a couple’s counselor. They’ll help the two of you get to the root of the problem. For example, if one person feels like the other partner doesn’t respect them, they may lash out over dishes not being done, a playful joke their partner makes, or their partner not picking up the phone. Until the source of the problem is addressed, the fighting will just continue."

Brown explains that if you and your partner never get into it, it could mean that one of you is holding back unaddressed issues. [6] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. It’s impossible for two people to be around each other all the time and agree on absolutely everything. If there’s zero conflict, it indicates that one (or both) of you is not speaking your truth, which can be very problematic in the long run. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source As Brown states, “Avoiding communication about touchy subjects will only cause an individual to feel at odds.” [8] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. If the relationship is relatively fresh, don’t worry about your lack of fighting. It’ll happen naturally over time. It’s normal for the beginning of a relationship to be extremely peaceful. [9] X Research source You don’t need fighting to be frequent for your relationship to be considered healthy. It’s perfectly fine if you and your partner only come into conflict a few times a year. Every couple is different when it comes to the frequency of their arguing. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Approach the conversation from an empathetic, calm perspective. If it’s “me vs. you” instead of “us vs. the problem,” things can go off the rails really fast. Actively hear your partner out, don’t interrupt them, and use a cool tone to respond—even if you’re really upset. If both of you can be respectful and calm, you can work towards a solution. [11] X Research source It often helps to remind yourself in your head, “I love this person; I care about them; don’t say something you’ll regret.” Do not try to “win.” There’s no winning here. It’s not a zero-sum game—the goal is to resolve a problem. You can only do that if you don’t approach arguments like they’re competitions. [12] X Research source"

Come up with a safe word (“timeout” is fine) so that you can pause the conversation if things get too heated for either of you. [14] X Research source Schedule time to argue! Knowing ahead of time that you’re going to argue takes a lot of the unpredictability out of it. Start each fight by agreeing on an objective. This way, you can both work towards a solution instead of spinning your wheels going back and forth. Finding a mutual objective is especially key if the two of you have been having the same fight over and over again, which happens when there’s no roadmap for the argument!"

      "content": "Use “I” language and avoid attacking who your partner fundamentally is. If one of you keeps saying “you never…” or “you don’t…,” it can feel like a boxing match. Frame things from your perspective and talk about how you feel in an argument. Using \"I\" statements is one of those small things that can really improve the quality of your conversations when the two of you disagree. [15] X Research source For example, let’s say you’d normally say something like, “You never clean up around the house. You make things so dirty! You let this kitchen just get so dirty, and then I get stuck cleaning it up.” Using the “I” rule, you might say, “I feel like I’m doing all of the work around here when the kitchen gets left like this. I know I can be a bit of a clean freak, but it’s really important to me.”"

A lack of mutual respect or insulting and demeaning language can contribute to a toxic environment or toxic relationship . If you do not feel like you’re a part of a team with your partner, something may be wrong. [16] X Research source Arguments can easily turn toxic in these situations. Here are some things to avoid when fighting to keep the argument productive, according to Brown: [17] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. Threats and ultimatums: Any variation of “if you don’t do X, I will do Y” can be a sign that the fight is becoming unproductive. Name-calling and personal attacks: If language starts to belittle either side, names are being called, and things get aggressive, the argument may be becoming toxic. Silent treatment: Withholding information or intentionally ignoring someone can make it difficult to express emotions and communicate openly, ultimately hurting the relationship.

      "title": "You and your partner’s communication style can affect how you fight.",
      "content": "You and your partner’s communication style can affect how you fight. There are 4 types of communication styles: aggressive, passive, passive-aggressive, and assertive. The ideal communication style is assertive, as it allows you to express your wants and needs openly and communicate better in a relationship . Take a look below to determine what communication you might have and how it can impact your arguments: [21] X Research source Aggressive communication is driven by anger and judgment. It often leads to inflexibility and hostile environments. Passive communication comes across as not communicating at all because you’re fearful, and it often leads to miscommunications and disagreements. Passive-aggressive communication is when you don’t directly communicate your emotions and bottle up negative feelings. Indirect communication can lead to confusion and resentment. Assertive communication is fueled by confidence and allows you to talk openly and honestly. Direct and honest communication promotes healthy connections."

      "title": "Most couples fight due to commitment issues, differing values, or simple miscommunication.",
      "content": "Most couples fight due to commitment issues, differing values, or simple miscommunication. Lack of communication is one of the biggest triggers for disagreements between couples—these conflicts can take different forms, but commitment-based conflicts all have the underlying issue of one person expecting a level of commitment that they’re not getting. [22] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, a couple may argue over doing the dishes because one partner expects a level of commitment when it comes to taking care of a shared space. When their partner doesn’t get that, it feels like a serious violation. [23] X Research source Differing values are also common triggers for fights—if each of you has different religious beliefs, political values, financial habits, or hopes for future children, these core components of who you are can cause serious fights. [24] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The good news here is that if you can find any kind of middle ground early on, these issues are often very easy to move on from. If you’re in a ton of debt and your partner is wealthy, making a rule like, “No fancy vacations until the debt is fixed, and no money lending but gifts are okay,” can really curb the fights. Lastly, a lot of fights just boil down to miscommunication . Someone might say the wrong thing, interpret sarcasm where none exists, or misunderstand the intention of an offhand comment. If two people fail to communicate in a way that feels equitable and honest, it can start all kinds of crazy arguments. Taking a step back to make sure you’re on the same page is huge here.

If one of you is yelling until you’re red in the face, something went wrong. We tend to imagine “fighting” as being passionate, aggressive, and intense, but that’s usually the worst way to go about it. If your conflicts are fair, respectful, calm, and productive, you don’t need to start counting the number of fights you two are having—it’s totally okay. [27] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It’s probably better to have 6 to 10 calm arguments a year than it is to have 1 giant fight where the two of you end up not talking for a month."

      "content": "How long into a relationship is it normal to fight? Fighting typically starts after the honeymoon phase ends. When a relationship is new and exciting, you tend to romanticize things and ignore potential problems. Brown describes this “elated state” as the honeymoon phase, which typically “fizzles the moment the spark [or excitement of a new relationship] fades.” [28] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 3 February 2022. Once this early period of the relationship is over, couples tend to be more realistic. The post-honeymoon phase is when the occasional fight starts popping up, and that’s totally normal. [29] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It may be surprising, but the honeymoon phase often lasts 6 to 12 months! It takes time, so don’t freak out that your relationship is dying if you’ve been together for a full year and now you’re suddenly fighting. [30] X Research source"
