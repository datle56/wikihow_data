      "content": "Upload your image . There are many free image hosting services, such as Picasa Web Albums, Imgur, Flickr, or Photobucket. Read the terms carefully. Some services will reduce your image quality, or take down your image if too many people view it (since this uses up the host's bandwidth). Some blog-hosting services let you upload images using the blog administrator tools. If you have a paid web host, upload the image to your own site using an FTP service . Creating an \"images\" directory is recommended to keep your files organized. If you want to use an image on another website, ask the creator for permission. If she grants it, download the image , then upload the image to an image hosting site."

Many forums use a custom system instead of HTML. Ask for help from other forum-goers if this doesn't work."

This is an empty tag, meaning it stands alone, with no closing tag. Everything you need to display your image will go inside the two angle brackets. [1] X Research source <img>"

Right-click the image (control-click on Mac) and select \"Copy Image Location.\" You can also click \"View Image\" to see the image alone on a page, then copy the URL in your address bar. If you uploaded the image to an images directory in your own website, link to it with /images/ yourfilenamehere . If this doesn't work, the images directory is probably inside another folder. Move it up to the root directory."

The src attribute is short for \"source,\" and tells the browser where to look to find the image. Write src=\" \" and paste the image URL in between the quotation marks. Here's an example: [2] X Research source <img src=\"http://www.exampleimagehost.com/my-cute-dog.jpg\">"

      "content": "Add an alt attribute. Technically your HTML has everything it needs to display the image, but it's best to add an alt attribute as well. This tells the browser what text to display when the image fails to load. More importantly, this helps search engines figure out what your image is about, and lets screen readers describe the image to visually impaired visitors. [3] X Research source Follow this example, changing the text inside the quotation marks: <img src=\"http://www.exampleimagehost.com/my-cute-dog.jpg\" alt=\"my dog eating a tangerine\"> If the image is not important to the page content, include the alt attribute with no text (alt=\"\").

Setting the width and height using HTML tells the browser to shrink or expand the image, which can be inconsistent across browsers and (rarely) cause display errors. If you want a quick and serviceable adjustment, use this format: [5] X Research source <img src=\"http://example.com/example.png\" alt=\"display this\" width=200 height=200> (Number of pixels, or the more phone-friendly \"CSS pixels\" in HTML5.) [6] X Research source [7] X Research source or <img src=\"http://example.com/example.png\" width=100% height=10%> (Percentage of web page dimensions, or percentage of HTML element containing the image.)
