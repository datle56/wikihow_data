      "title": "Wear an off-white dress, or camisole and skirt.",
      "content": "Wear an off-white dress, or camisole and skirt. Mulan’s original outfit has a floor-length, cream-colored skirt, and a hint of whitish fabric showing underneath her top. There are two ways you can achieve this look. If you can find a long, off-white dress with a square or boat neckline, you can wear that underneath your costume. Alternately, you can wear a floor-length off-white skirt and a camisole. [2] X Research source Pay attention to choosing fabrics like satin or brocade for added texture and authenticity, as these materials also reflect the elegance of Mulan’s attire. The camisole should have a neckline that reaches about up to your collarbone. Look for a dress or skirt in your closet, online or at a second-hand store. If you like to sew, you can make the skirt ."

      "content": "Get a light green top with long, wide sleeves. Preferably, the body of the shirt will be more fitted than the sleeves. You’ll be adding another layer of clothing over your torso, so you don’t want the green top to be bulky. Look for a light apple green color."

      "title": "Make Mulan’s top outer garment.",
      "content": "Make Mulan’s top outer garment. If you can find a tank top or short dress with a royal blue body and thick teal straps, that would be ideal. You’ll be more likely to find a close match by shopping online. However, that’s quite a specific look to track down, so you may want to improvise instead. To recreate this garment, get a strapless tube top or dress that reaches about hip-length. The length can be a little longer or shorter – it doesn’t have to be exact. Wear a turquoise tank top with wide straps underneath it, or sew wide teal ribbon straps onto the strapless piece. This piece should go around your torso as a middle piece rather than being worn like a regular tank top."

If the toy dog you’re using doesn’t come with a blue collar, use a blue ribbon around its neck. There are a few ways you can incorporate Little Brother into your costume. Simply carry the stuffed toy around with you. Have the toy dog peeking out of your purse or tote bag, if you’re bringing one. Attach it to your costume. You can sew it to the front of your dress with a simple stitch ."

      "content": "Find a navy blue fabric. If you can find a wide scarf or shawl, that will work. You could also use a long tube top or a short strapless dress. Otherwise you can purchase some dark blue fabric. The piece should be able to wrap completely around you from front to back, and span from your bust to your thighs. Try the piece on or hold it up to you to make sure it will be long and wide enough. [4] X Research source If the piece is loose fabric or a scarf, have someone help you pin it closed on the back when you put your costume on. Alternately, you can apply hook-and-loop fastener to the piece so that you can put it on yourself."

      "content": "Add a mauve sash. Your sash should be at least two yards long; if you can’t make a sash or buy one, get the same length in an extra wide ribbon. Hang it around the back of your neck, as if you were about to put on a necktie, but so that both ends of fabric hang evenly in front of you. Cross the fabric once at your navel, and then wrap it around your waist and back to the front. Continue wrapping the mauve sash around your waist until there is just a bit of it left, then tuck the bits in and pin them. The wrap of the sash around your waist should cover where the fabric crosses in the front, so that it looks like it comes to a “V” rather than an “X.” Use a safety pin to secure the fabric from the inside."

At the left front of your waist, loop the fabric over itself as if you’re about to make a simple knot. Instead of crossing it again to finish off the knot, arrange the two straps so that they’re hanging on top of each other. Use a safety pin concealed inside the pink sash to hold the waist belt and straps in place."

You can wear any type of large gold medallion on a chain necklace or a long gold ribbon. Or you can recreate Mulan’s Crest of the Emperor medallion in a simple or a complex way. [6] X Research source To make a simple medallion, cut out a circle from foam board or cardboard. Draw the dragon on in pencil, and then color it in with bronze and gold metallic paint markers. Punch a hole in it at the top, and attach it to a long chain necklace with gold ribbon. You can also use a hot glue gun to attach gold ribbon around the edge of the medallion. To make a complex medallion, you can use worbla over craft foam, wood, or clay, and paint the finished product."

The sword has a wavy blade and a tip like the head of an arrow. You can look for a prop sword to buy online or at costume shops. To make your own prop sword, make a template out of foam board. Make the sword’s handle with an armature of toilet paper rolls and masking tape. Cover the full creation with papier-mâché paste and strips of newspaper . Once that dries, you can paint it with acrylic paints. Optionally, you can wrap the middle of the sword with brown paper or beige fabric and tie it with a burgundy string, the way Mulan presented it to the Emperor. If you add another loop of string to the knot that is long enough to wear like a sling over your head and one shoulder, you won’t have to carry it around loose."
