      "title": "Look for loose fibers between your walls and in your ceilings.",
      "content": "Look for loose fibers between your walls and in your ceilings. Keep an eye out for light, fluffy fibers that are used as insulation. They could also be found stuffed in paper bags and inserted into floor joists. It could be loose-fill asbestos fiber, and is extremely dangerous. Any disturbance of the fibers could cause them to go airborne and put you at risk of inhaling asbestos. [1] X Research source If you suspect that you may have loose-fill asbestos fiber, do not try to clean it up. Call an asbestos professional immediately. Loose-fill asbestos fiber can be a pale white color, or it could be a darker, dirty color, depending on how old or how dirty it is. Look in your attic for loose-fill asbestos."

      "content": "Check the underside of your roof for a white or gray rough coating. Asbestos spray coating was a commonly used way to insulate a roof and sometimes the sides of buildings. It will look like a rough layer of either white or gray paint. Check the underside of your roof in your attic to see if there is a layer that looks like it was sprayed on. [2] X Research source It is very easy to overspray asbestos coating, so there may also be some splashback in the area around your roof from when the coating was installed. Call an asbestos professional immediately if you think your roof may have asbestos spray coating."

      "content": "Keep an eye out for old wall panel boards and ceiling tiles. Prior to 1980, asbestos insulating board (AIB) was a commonly used material to insulate walls, attics, and ceilings. It’s very difficult to tell if an insulating board contains asbestos because they can come in a variety of sizes, designs, shapes, and colors. AIB can be found in partition walls, ceiling tiles, panels below windows, and as fireproofing panels in fire doors. If you believe you may have AIB in your building, call a professional to inspect it. Do not try to remove it yourself to bring for testing."

      "content": "Treat any insulation as if it is asbestos if you’re unsure. Asbestos can be present in almost any type of insulation and can look very different than you may expect. There isn’t necessarily a surefire way to tell if your insulation has asbestos unless it’s labeled or you have an expert take a look. If you’re unsure if your insulation contains asbestos, play it safe and contact a professional to inspect it. [3] X Research source Do not try to remove insulation that could contain asbestos yourself. There are strict standards regarding the handling and disposal of asbestos."

If the building materials in your home or business won’t be disturbed, you don’t need to worry about looking for asbestos. Even if your insulation contains asbestos, if it isn’t disturbed, the asbestos won’t be present in the air to cause any harm. But if you plan to remodel your home, have an asbestos professional inspect your building first.

      "content": "Look for asbestos in buildings built before 1980. Asbestos was a very popular insulating material from the 1930s to the 1970s. Older buildings, schools, and homes that were built during this time period are likely to contain some material that contains asbestos. [6] X Research source If you had a home inspection, it’s likely that they did not look for asbestos insulation. Knowing when your building was built can also tell you if there are any other potential toxins, like lead, that may be present."

If you notice that you have insulation that is falling apart in your building, have a professional inspect for asbestos. [7] X Research source Insulation that is crumbling or flaking can get into the air and be breathed in by people. If there’s asbestos present in the insulation, it could cause serious harm to anyone who breathes it in."
