It can be hard to find a bio that’s the perfect mix of cool, clever, and unique—and that also fits your personality and profile! Here are our best tips to craft the perfect IG bio for companies, brands, influencers, and everyday users: Showcase your personality: Write “a short description as to who you are as a person or brand…not complete sentences, but a couple of keywords that authentically describe you. Blogger, lifestyle, influencer, comedian,” etc., advises Bachelor. Add a link in bio: Use a third-party service like LinkTree to connect “your website, Instagram, Facebook, and all of the different social media platforms,” recommends Bachelor. “I think it’s best to do hub links…so you’re not constantly having to change the link in your bio.” Include your contact information: If you want people to contact you through your IG, putting your email in your bio is a good way for people to contact you, says Bachelor."
