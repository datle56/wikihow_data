      "content": "Create a new email address for your business. To create a business account, you'll need to make sure you're using an email address that doesn't have your real name attached to it. This ensures that nothing about your account will accidentally display your real name to the people you exchange money with. You will need to upload proof of your business name when using this method. So, if you don't actually have a business, you won't be able to hide your real name in PayPal with this method. Creating a new email address also allows you to keep your personal account open, which means you can continue using it with the people you don't mind knowing your real name. If you do use the same email address, PayPal will close your personal account and you'll only have your business account. [1] X Research source"
