      "content": "Brush your dog daily. Morkies have a coat that is long, soft, and fine, and requires daily brushing to avoid tangles. Brushing also removes dirt, dandruff, and dead hair, and distributes natural oils through your dog’s coat to make it shiny. Once a day, brush your dog very gently with a slicker brush or pin brush. Although Morkies are a non-shedding breed, your pet may lose a bit hair when groomed, so brush it on an easy to clean surface (e.g. the floor, a tabletop, a mat specifically reserved for grooming). [2] X Research source Start by brushing your morkie in the direction of hair growth. Don’t brush your pet’s hair in the opposite direction. Brushing also stimulates the skin to produce oils and stimulate new hair growth"

      "content": "Trim its hair. The hair growing around your Yorkie’s forehead can get into its eyes and cause tears, which can stain its hair. Use a small comb to gently pull this hair away from your Morkie’s face. With small grooming scissors, carefully trim the hair just enough to ensure that it doesn’t irritate your pet’s eyes. [3] X Research source If your Morkie has any mats or tangles that brushing cannot remove, gently cut them out with the grooming scissors."

      "content": "Clean around its eyes. To clean away tears, prevent the growth of bacteria, and make your dog more comfortable, clean its eyes daily. Wet a soft cloth with warm water and gently run it over your Morkie’s eyes to clean tears away. If tearing occurs during the day, repeat this process. [4] X Research source"

Don’t insert the cotton swab into the ear canal. Gently remove any mats around the ears with trimming shears. If there are no mats, leave the hair long to prevent debris from getting into your pet’s ears."

Such problems could include fleas, ticks, skin irritation, dry patches, and inflammation. Daily inspection can reveal these issues early enough to have them easily treated by a veterinarian.

A regular shower might overwhelm your small dog."

Once a day, handle its front and back paws and gently tap its nails with a metal spoon or clippers. Place it on a tall spot (e.g. a kitchen counter) and have it stand there for several moments to get used to being on an elevated surface. [10] X Research source"

Ask other questions, such as: [11] X Research source ”Do you have much experience grooming Morkies?” ”How many years of experience do you have?” ”Did you complete training at a grooming school?”"

Groomers will give your Morkie a proper bath, trim its hair and nails, clean its ears, and brush its teeth if requested. Puppies should be brought to their first grooming session when they are 10-12 weeks old, or when they have received their second round of vaccines. [12] X Research source"
