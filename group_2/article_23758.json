      "content": "There are a variety of medical conditions that can cause a lack of appetite. A decreased appetite can be a sign of basically any illness, since we tend to shy away from food when we’re not feeling well. This is why it’s so important to visit your doctor if you experience a sudden or unusual lack of appetite. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Serious illnesses that cause a lack of appetite include cancer, liver disease, kidney disease, heart disease, COPD, hepatitis, HIV, and certain thyroid conditions. Other conditions that trigger a loss of appetite include influenza, the common cold, urinary infections, chest infections, acid reflux, and diabetes. [2] X Research source You may also experience a decreased appetite if you’re pregnant, constipated, or nauseous. [3] X Research source Certain medications can cause a lack of a desire to eat. The main culprits are antidepressants, ADHD medications, painkillers, and chemotherapy. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s common for children and elderly people to have a lack of appetite. Children are naturally fussy about what foods they’ll eat, so they often appear to have a decreased appetite. This is pretty normal, and it’s not anything to worry about if they aren’t losing weight or refusing to eat all day. People also tend to lose a bit of their appetite as they get older as well, although it’s not entirely clear why this is the case. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source So long as someone is eating a healthy, balanced diet and they’re getting enough calories to maintain their energy levels, they’re eating enough food."

If you stick to smaller meals and eat more frequently, you’re unlikely to end up feeling put off by the idea of sitting down for food. This is also a great way to keep your metabolism stable, which can make it easier to maintain a steady appetite.

You could watch some TV, chat with some friends, or browse social media to keep your mind preoccupied while you’re finishing your food.

If you have a zinc deficiency, zinc may boost your desire to eat more often.

If you do want to try a supplement without talking to your doctor and you’re healthy, it’s probably fine to try taking a daily fish oil supplement. Any negative side effects, such as bad breath or loose stools, are going to be very minor."

MCT oil (short for medium-chain triglycerides) is just the fatty part of coconut oil.

[22] X Research source Unless you’re allergic to coconuts or you have liver disease, MCT oil should be perfectly safe to consume.
