      "content": "Choose a moisturizing foundation if you have dry skin. When your skin looks particularly dry, any wrinkles and fine lines will be accentuated. When you're choosing a foundation, look for ones that have moisturizing qualities. Ingredients like glycerin and hyaluronic acid will help your skin retain moisture throughout the day, while foundations containing salicylic acid can dry your skin out even more. Finally, avoid matte foundations. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a foundation with SPF.",
      "content": "Use a foundation with SPF. You can also apply sunscreen with your makeup .

      "title": "Exfoliate your face.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your face. If you don’t exfoliate regularly, this is a great routine to pick up. Mature skin can look dull and colorless, which won’t do your wrinkles any favors. Scrubbing off the dead skin cells 1-2 times a week will help to brighten your complexion. Exfoliation can also increase the production of collagen, the protein responsible for keeping skin plump and tight. [4] X Research source You can use either a chemical or a manual exfoliant. Generally, chemical exfoliants are a more popular choice for aging skin. Look for products that have lactic acid or other gentle exfoliants to incorporate into your skincare routine."

      "title": "Moisturize your skin.",
      "content": "Moisturize your skin. Mature skin is often dry, and dry skin can make wrinkles look more prominent.

      "content": "Prime your skin. A makeup primer is key at any age, because it creates an even base for your makeup to go onto. When you have wrinkles, primer is even more important. Apply it over your entire face. Make sure that you get primer into your wrinkles, rather than glossing over them. You may need to pull gently at the skin to open up the wrinkle a bit, allowing the primer to get into it. Look for primers with a silicone base. These will help smooth out the skin and conceal fine lines."

      "title": "Apply your foundation.",
      "content": "Apply your foundation. Choose a thin, light foundation. With thicker foundations, you run a greater risk of having product collect in fine lines. Just like you did with the primer, make sure to get your foundation into the wrinkles. Rather than smoothing it over the wrinkles as if to cover them, you want to make sure the product is being evenly distributed all over your skin. This will help give your skin an even, more seamless appearance. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill in your eyebrows. While eyebrows don't make the skin look smooth, thinning eyebrows can age otherwise young-looking faces. Gently fill in sparse areas on your brow using a brow pencil, gel, or pomade. Use light strokes or flicks to mimic the shape of natural hairs. [9] X Research source You don't need to build big, bold brows to make your face look younger. Simply focus on areas where the hair is a little patchy or thin. Fill these areas in and your brows will quickly look younger."
