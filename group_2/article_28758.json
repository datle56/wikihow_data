      "content": "Paint the ceiling white or a light color. Painting is one of the cheapest ways to make a big change to a room. Light colors are always recommended for small rooms or low ceilings. [1] X Research source If you prefer dark walls, avoid using white on the ceiling. This creates a horizontal line that will make the ceiling look even lower. Try painting the ceiling a few shades lighter than the walls instead. [2] X Research source Pale blue or aqua tinted ceilings give the illusion of distance and will make ceilings look further away.

      "content": "Choose a matte finish for best results. Color is not the only aspect of the paint that can contribute to the apparent height of the ceiling. A matte finish hides flaws and draws focus away. A glossy finish creates a reflective surface with benefits similar to a mirror but can also show imperfections. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Paint the crown molding. By painting it the same color and sheen as the wall, you can give the appearance of pushing the ceiling up a few inches. If there is a big difference in ceiling and wall color, choose a shade somewhere in between for the crown molding. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Construct vertical patterns with wall hangings. By placing artwork and framed pictures vertically and in a linear pattern on the wall, you can create more visual interest upward. The more vertical shapes in the room, the greater illusion of height. Place items as close to the ceiling as possible. For a more dramatic effect, choose one large vertical item to accentuate the height."

      "title": "Use mirrors to increase light.",
      "content": "Use mirrors to increase light. Mirrors are often used to make rooms look bigger by reflecting light and giving the appearance of an ever-expanding room. By hanging a vertical mirror or even leaning it against the wall, the same effect can be made on the height of the room. Again, one large vertical mirror positioned close to the ceiling will have the most benefit. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Install window treatments close to the ceiling.",
      "content": "Install window treatments close to the ceiling. Make sure that the curtains reach the floor or even pool at the bottom for an even greater appearance of height. Use a bold pattern on the curtains if it is the only pattern in the room to accentuate the height. [9] X Research source Another option is to remove window treatments altogether to increase light. Youâ€™ll have to consider the loss of privacy or use of blinds with this option. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Position shelves near the ceiling. Not only will you draw the eye upward, you will also open valuable floor space by creating storage off the ground. You can increase the height interest by adorning the shelf with bold pieces like large colorful vases. Extra precaution should be taken with shelving installation, especially overhead. Make sure you level the shelf and anchor it to a stud to avoid injury. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Use low profile furniture.",
      "content": "Use low profile furniture. This technique will increase the actual space from furniture to ceiling and make the ceiling look higher. Large, bulky furniture will make the space seem closed in and less spacious. [12] X Research source Be deliberate in what you buy to furnish a room with a low ceiling. Make each piece count and consider lighter colors to really open up the space. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Add uplighting. Install sconces or wall lights to draw the eye upward. Even a well-placed lamp can make a ceiling look higher. [14] X Research source Position lights to shine toward and up the wall when possible to create more reflective light and attention upward. Avoid pendant lights and the use of overhead lighting which bring the focus downward. [15] X Research source"
