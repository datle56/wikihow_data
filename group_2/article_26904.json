      "content": "Spray a silicone gummy mold with nonstick cooking spray. Get out your choice of silicone molds so you have about 30 gummy cavities to fill. Then, spray the inside of the mold with nonstick cooking spray, which helps the gummies release easily. Place the greased mold on a baking sheet and set it aside. [1] X Research source Use as many molds as you need to equal 30 gummies. For example, you could use 2 molds if they both have 15 cavities. If you prefer, brush the inside of the mold with melted coconut oil."

      "title": "Pour a flavored beverage, corn syrup, and gelatin into a measuring jug.",
      "content": "Pour a flavored beverage, corn syrup, and gelatin into a measuring jug. Put 1 cup (240 ml) of a flavored beverage into a microwave-safe measuring jug or bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (40 g) of corn syrup and 4 1-ounce (7 g) packets of unflavored gelatin. [2] X Research source Try making CBD gummies with lemonade, sports drink, or juice. Just don't use juice that contains pineapple, kiwi, mango, ginger root, papaya, or figs since these prevent the gelatin from setting. Mixing the gummy liquid in a measuring jug makes it easier to pour the liquid into the mold."

Stir the mixture well and microwave it for another 30 seconds. Then, stir the mixture again to help the gelatin dissolve completely. [4] X Research source If you still see grainy gelatin in the liquid, microwave the mixture for another 30 seconds and stir it again."
