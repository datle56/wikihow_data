Then, squirt the paper until the spots you’re looking to shape and color are damp. Note that the liquid you use will give the paper a different look. Water won’t color the paper, but will enable further alterations. Tea will give a slight brown color, while coffee will give the sheet a darker color."

This damage simulates the passage of time; the older you want the sheet of paper to look, the more damage you need to include. If you want to make darker, deeper creases, crumple the damp paper again. Be careful not to rip the page in half."

[4] X Expert Source Nicole Bolin Crafts & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 9 September 2020. You can also affect the color of your paper during the brewing process. If using coffee, you can darken or lighten the color by using more or less coffee grounds. With tea, the resulting shade of your sheet of paper will be affected by how long you leave the tea in the water. A longer infusion will result in a darker shade, while a short infusion will make for a lighter shade. Let your liquid cool before proceeding to the next step."

Hold the edges of the paper between 1/2 inch (1cm) and 1 inch (2.5cm) above the flame. Move the flame along the edges, going back and forth along the sheet’s perimeter. This will create the darkened look of paper that's been around for a very long time and been damaged by time and circumstance. Do not put it too long on one place by the candle.

If you want to burn holes into your sheet of paper, leave it above the flame slightly longer. The heat will eventually burn through, and a small flame will catch. Be quick to blow it out. If the paper catches fire quicker than you can blow it out, drop it in the sink and douse it in water."
