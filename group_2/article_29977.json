      "content": "Remove the bottom of your medium pot with an angle grinder. Put a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide piece of masking tape around the bottom of your medium-sized pot. Use an angle grinder to cut the bottom off of the pot following the top line of the tape. Set the bottom of the medium pot aside to use later. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Drill 4 holes around the circumference of the bottom of the large pot. Flip the large pot over so that it is resting firmly on the ground. Use a drill bit that is strong enough to drill through concrete. Make 4 holes around the large hole that is already in your pot, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the holes and the outer edge. Space them out so that they don’t connect and be sure that the bottom of your pot does not get compromised. [3] X Research source You can also use a masonry drill bit to create the holes."

Use the same concrete drill bit to create 4 evenly spaced holes around the hole already in the pot. Leave about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) between the holes and the outer edge of the pot.

      "content": "Place a few pieces of a broken brick underneath of the large pot. Smash a brick with a sledge hammer into 3 or 4 large pieces. Set these pieces on the ground where you’d like to put your Tandoor oven. Place your largest pot on top of the bricks, making sure that the hole at the bottom of the pot is not covered by any brick pieces. [5] X Research source If you don’t have any old bricks, you can use a few flat rocks as long as they are all the same height. Set up your oven on brick or concrete so that you don’t burn your grass."

Do not place any brick pieces on the hole in the middle of the pot. [6] X Research source The hole in the middle of the pot allows airflow when the fire is going. If you cover it up, the fire will extinguish itself."

Make sure the small pot is balanced evenly on the bricks and it doesn’t wobble. [7] X Research source Prevent the small pot from wobbling by making sure your bricks are laid with the flat side down."

Fill up your large pot to its brim with rocks. Make sure there is little airflow or excess space in between the rocks. [9] X Research source You can purchase lava rocks or vermiculite at most garden supply stores. Vermiculite is a mineral that expands when it is heated. Lava rocks are larger, so you will need less of them to fill your space."

Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the end of your skewer empty. Place your skewers into your medium pot with the empty portion sticking into the coals. [11] X Research source Traditionally, Tandoor ovens were used to cook chicken, beef, and lamb."

Depending on the heat of your fire, this could take several hours. Do not leave your Tandoor oven unattended while the charcoal is still burning.

Keep your Tandoor oven outside underneath a shelter that will shield it from the worst of the rain or snow. If you live in a mild climate, you can keep your oven uncovered. [15] X Research source You can also store your Tandoor oven inside of a shed."
