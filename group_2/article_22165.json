      "title": "Schedule the appointment.",
      "content": "Schedule the appointment. Routine appointments should be scheduled at a time between your periods. The doctor will not be able to complete the full exam if you are on your period the day of your appointment. [2] X Research source If you are having an urgent problem, let the office know that. Schedule for the first available appointment. Proceed with seeking the medical care you need. If this is your first gynecological exam, let the person scheduling the appointment know. The office may schedule the appointment differently to get started with your medical record, and accommodate any special needs for young people during their first exam. [3] X Research source Note that routine gynaecological exams can be performed by family physicians (and generally are). There is no need to see a gynaecologist (a specialist) unless your family doctor suspects more severe concerns that require a higher level of medical training to be fully addressed. It is recommended to have your first gynaecological exam in your early twenties, or within three years of the onset of sexual activity (whichever comes first). The recommendations vary depending on location as it is a loose guideline, so if in doubt ask your family doctor at what age you should be seen for your first full exam. Be aware that any young adult or teen that is sexually active, having problems with their menstrual cycle, or has not started their cycle by the age of 16, should be seen for a routine gynaecological exam by their doctor.

[5] X Research source Avoid sexual intercourse for 24 hours before the exam. Irritation from sexual activity may cause some of the test results to be difficult to interpret. Avoid feminine products prior to the exam. Do not douche or use any feminine deodorants, sprays, or creams for 24 hours before the appointment. [6] X Research source Dress appropriately. Remember you will be removing your clothes. Try to avoid wearing clothing that is hard to get in or out of."

      "content": "Expect questions about your general medical history. Answer thoroughly and honestly. Your doctor needs to have as much information as possible in order to effectively treat any existing problems, and work with you to prevent future complications. [8] X Research source Some medical offices will have you answer questions about your medical history by filling out forms, while others may do this in person. Be prepared to discuss your sexual history. Your doctor will need to know if you are sexually active. They may ask about breast, abdominal, vaginal, or sexual problems, that you don’t think are normal. That includes being taken advantage of sexually, or sexual abuse. [9] X Research source Your doctor will also ask about your current and past use of contraceptives."

      "content": "Anticipate questions about your period. Be able to tell the nurse or doctor the first date of your most recent period, and the age when you had your first period. They may also ask the age that your breasts began to develop. [10] X Research source They will ask if your periods are on a regular cycle, such as every 28 days, how long they usually last, and if you have any problems, like bad cramps, while you have your period. [11] X Research source They will ask if you have episodes of spotting, or bleeding, between your periods. They will likely ask how heavy you bleed during your periods. You can usually answer this by telling them how many pads or tampons you need to use, especially for the first 48 hours of your cycle. [12] X Research source"

This may include unusual vaginal discharge, bad odor, itching in your vaginal area, unusual pain or discomfort in your abdomen or vaginal area, pain during sex, and any changes, pain, or problems with your breasts. [13] X Research source Your doctor has the option to order STI (sexually transmitted infection) testing for you if either you or your doctor has a concern. A urine test can be done for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea, and a blood test for HIV, herpes, and/or syphilis. There is no harm in undergoing STI testing if you have any concern at all, as there are effective treatments available if you do have an infection, and treating it sooner rather than later can help to avoid long-term complications. For instance, treating chlamydia and/or gonorrhea from the outset prevents the long-term development of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), which is when the infection has been around for a while and can lead to other complications like fertility issues down the road or the development of chronic pelvic pain. Your health care provider can test for trichomonas, gonorrhea, and chlamydia using a urine sample."

If one is not present in the room, ask for a nurse to be with you. The external areas will be examined, then an internal exam will be done. The external areas examined include the clitoris, labia, vaginal opening, and rectum. The internal exam includes the use of a speculum to check the vaginal canal, cervix, perform the Pap smear, and take other tissue samples if needed. A digital exam is performed to feel the uterus and ovaries. However, the internal exam may not be necessary if you have never been sexually active. Make sure to let your doctor know if you are uncomfortable with the internal exam. If you have been sexually abused, then it may take several visits before you will feel comfortable with this type of exam. Be sure to communicate your concerns with your doctor. The entire exam takes only a few minutes."

[20] X Research source This causes a feeling of pressure but should not be painful. If you feel pain, tell the doctor.

This is called a Pap test and is not recommended before the age of 21. [22] X Research source The sample taken will be sent to a lab and examined for any cells that look abnormal or cancerous. Most people have perfectly normal Pap tests. [23] X Research source Typically, you will be notified of the test results from your Pap smear within 10 to 14 days.

[28] X Research source You can also see your doctor sooner if you have other reproductive questions that come up, such as a desire to start birth control pills, questions around safe sex and/or sexually transmitted infections, or questions surrounding pregnancy. Once you become sexually active, your doctor can guide you in selecting the best type of birth control for you. This may include prescription products that your doctor can prescribe for you. The doctor will help monitor their use. [29] X Research source Common forms of birth control include oral contraceptives, or birth control pills, patches, injections, condoms, vaginal devices like diaphragms, and intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. [30] X Research source Remember that your doctor is trained to provide people with the information they need to make the best choice for them in any area of reproductive health, so your doctor will always be willing to see you and offer you advice even if it is only around sexual health questions you may have and not for a routine exam."
