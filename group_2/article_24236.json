      "title": "Decide on the type of stall.",
      "content": "Decide on the type of stall. A quick search on the Internet or a walk through the plumbing aisles of a home improvement store will reveal the many different kinds of shower stall on the market. A wide variety of options are available, including those with features such as a bench for sitting inside the stall, shapes ranging from rectangles to semi-circles, and sizes to fit any need. That said, there are also a few specific varieties, and the differences between them can impact the installation process. [1] X Research source Single-piece prefabricated showers are complete units, usually made of fiberglass or acrylic. They tend to be more expensive than other shower stall sets, and some also claim that they can be more difficult to install. As you could probably guess, the complete unit can be a bit bulky, and for that reason difficult to carry through doorways or up stairs. On the plus side, they tend to be solidly constructed and easier to clean. Interlocking multi-piece units will usually come in a set of four to six large pieces, including the shower pan (the base area where you would stand in the shower and that connects to the drain), wall coverings (for the side(s) where the unit will be mounted along the bathroom wall), side sections (that will not be placed along the bathroom wall), and a door. Quite a few of these kits are considered easy to assemble, and they generally cost much less than single-piece units."

Not only do you need to make sure that you have enough pipe, you must also be certain to obtain the appropriate parts that will allow you to connect the new pipes to existing ones. Shower unit/kit. Waterproof caulk/sealant. It is probably best to obtain a silicone-based sealant or caulk, a variety known for their resistance to water. Tools, such as wrenches and screwdrivers."

      "title": "Clear and prepare the intended shower site.",
      "content": "Clear and prepare the intended shower site. It may be preferable to remove bathroom tiles or other floor coverings and install the shower directly on the base of the floor itself. You must also identify the appropriate location for the drain hole--measure the shower pan to determine the location--and cut a hole through the floor. If your plumbing is coming through a wall and not, say, a basement area in which the pipes are exposed, you must tear out the portions of the wall. Obviously, this must be one of your first steps."

      "title": "Build a frame to support the stall (if applicable).",
      "content": "Build a frame to support the stall (if applicable). Some shower kits will require that you build a structure to support the shower pan or even brace a whole prefabricated unit. Oftentimes the unit will have to be screwed into place, and so you must build the required structures that will allow you to do so. [2] X Research source For some units, at least some of the frame building will have to be completed after the shower stall has been put into place. Read the instructions carefully. Some multi-piece shower kits come with a kind of frame that will be used to hold up the sides. Again, go through the instructions that came with your kit before you install in order to determine how your shower stall will fit into your bathroom."

Follow these steps: Turn off the main water supply. Utilizing traditional plumbing methods, run hot and cold pipes to correspond with the holes for faucet handles in the shower stall. Attach the correctly threaded extension piping for the shower head, using thread seal tape and a pipe wrench. Install the faucet handles and the shower head. Turn the main water supply on and check for leaks. Connect the drainage lines. Secure the drain pipe with the drain kit (that either came with the unit or was purchased separately). The drain should be sealed with plumber's putty and tightened into place to prevent leakage. (For more on plumbing a bathroom, see guides here and here .)"

Shower kits with multiple pieces will require this step, but it is one that really can be delayed until the project is nearly complete. If you don't want to work on plumbing inside of a tiny shower stall, chose to leave this step for the end. For some kits, the side mounted to the wall will have to be screwed into place, while others just recommend that your use heavy duty caulk. Keep this in mind when purchasing your sealants, as some can also be used as adhesives."
