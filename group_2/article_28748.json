When you find some, click or hit the bottom block in the stalk to make it drop a resource. Collect 3 sugarcane from different stalks so you have enough to craft your paper later on. [1] X Research source If you’re playing in Creative Mode, you don’t have to collect sugarcane. You can find it in your inventory under the Miscellaneous tab."

Find a nearby tree and hold down the Attack button to hit one of the wood blocks until it breaks. Collect the wood resource that drops from the tree to add it to your inventory. Find and destroy another wood block the same way. [2] X Research source You can cut through wood faster if you equip an ax before you start hitting the block. If you’re playing on a computer, the left mouse button is Attack. If you’re on a console, hold the right trigger down. On mobile, hold your finger down on the block you want to destroy."
