Essential oil is the distilled, concentrated essence of lavender made from the flowers. When you use the flowers themselves, the resulting water is very light, but still quite aromatic. Here's what you'll need: A bunch of lavender stems fresh or dried (for a total of 2 tablespoons of buds) 1/2 cup water Glass bowl Spray bottle Funnel Fine-mesh strainer"

      "title": "Strip the lavender buds from their stems.",
      "content": "Strip the lavender buds from their stems. Lavender flowers grow as little buds along straight stems. To make lavender water, you don't need the stems; the buds contain the floral scent. To remove them from the stems, hold a stem over the glass bowl. Gently pinch the stem at its base, and run your fingers from the base to the tip. The buds will fall off into the bowl. You can also buy dried lavender buds that have already been removed from their stems. Look in gourmet food stores or herb shops. This is a great way to use lavender plants that may be growing in your yard."

The water is now ready to use on your linens, as air freshener, or as a tool for aromatherapy. If you want the water to have a longer shelf life, you can mix in one ounce of either witch hazel or vodka. Shake the bottle well to distribute it throughout. You may also store it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh."
