      "content": "Know the risk of jailbreaking. Jailbreaking allows you to access unofficial apps and tweaks for your iPad. This also bypasses security features put in place by Apple and makes your iPad more susceptible to viruses and other malware. In rare cases, the jailbreak process may render your iPad inoperable. Lastly, jailbreaking is not supported by Apple and will void any warranty you have on your iPad. Continue at your own risk. Semi-Untethered jailbreaking: Some jailbreaks are semi-untethered. This means that the jailbreak works until you reboot your iPad . Once your iPad has been restarted, you will need to use the jailbreak app on your computer again to re-activate the jailbreak. You will need a Windows computer, a USB flash drive, and a supported iPad to use this method."
