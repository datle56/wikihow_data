      "content": "Gather your supplies. It's always helpful to have all your supplies laid out in front of your before you begin your project. This way you can stay focused without the interruptions that would otherwise occur as you had to search for new materials. Depending on what kind of greeting card you plan to make, you'll need glue, scissors or a paper cutter, paper or blank cards, envelopes, small decorations to put on the card, and a pen or pencil. Buy some materials at the store to start off with when making cards. You can also recycle things around the house. Items such as buttons, ribbon, and old belts, all look great when properly attached to cards."

      "content": "Take out a blank card, or fold a piece of paper in half. If you decide to use a piece of paper you have plenty of options. You can cut the paper down to a smaller size using a paper cutter, or even cut it into different shapes. Consider using construction paper if you want a tougher material or something more colorful. [1] X Research source If you plan on cutting your paper with a paper cutter, use a ruler to define the lines before you start cutting. This will make it easier to keep everything straight and even."

      "content": "Add decorations to your card . [2] X Research source You can have a lot of fun here. You can draw something running throughout the card, like a sea monster or a landscape. You could draw a scene in the daytime on one side, and another scene in the nighttime on the other side. If you know the person you're giving the card to, try to make something that would appeal to them. If you're just trying to make a general card, try to decorate the card in such a way that would match the theme of the greeting. For example, if you're making a birthday card maybe you should include cakes and balloons. Another option for decorating is to use scrap book materials [3] X Research source or other craft items. You can cut out pictures from magazines and glue these into your greeting card."

      "title": "Consider the text you want to include.",
      "content": "Consider the text you want to include. Most greeting cards have generalized text before you get into the personal greeting. You can skip this part if you want, but if you're trying to emulate a greeting card that you would find at a store, you might want to include some sort of greeting. Write something that matches the occasion. For example, you could write “Congratulations on your wedding and your many happy years ahead” for a newly married couple."

      "title": "Include personalized text.",
      "content": "Include personalized text. [4] X Research source The best part about a card is that it includes personalized writing. Generally this text wishes the person well and includes more detail. If you're making a greeting card to give to someone else so that they can write in it and give it as a gift, skip this step. Consider putting your signature on the back of the card so that the person it is being given to knows who made it."

      "content": "Make an opening. You can make an opening in your paper rectangle by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Now make another fold two inches from the top. Once you've done that, you need to draw a one-inch line from the corner of this fold at a 45 degree angle inward. Cut along that inch line. [5] X Research source When you unfold the paper, you should be left with an 'X' cut in your original paper. The cut that you make will be going through multiple layers because of your folds to form this 'X'."

      "content": "Find a die cutting machine and other materials. These shaker-like cards are slightly more difficult to make than other cards because you'll have to invest in a die cutting machine. You could also try to cut the shapes out manually but it is much more difficult to make them all exactly the same shape and size. Other materials include card stock, a paper cutter, a glue pen, craft glue, acetate, and filler material such as beads and sequins. All of these items can be purchased at a craft store."

There are some online card-making sites available that you can use, but most of them are of lower quality than downloadable software. Here, we're using Canva. Other software options include PageMaker or InDesign. If you're new to making greeting cards, try user-friendly programs like Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory or Hallmark Card Studio. Software like Microsoft Word usually has greeting card templates, which can be helpful. [7] X Research source To make a greeting card on a Mac, use Pages. If you are wondering how to make a greeting card on an iPhone, try downloading an app like Cardstore Greeting Cards or Ink Cards. [8] X Research source"

Pick one that matches the theme and style you’re going for so that you don’t have to change it too much. [9] X Research source Most greeting card templates have a set color palette, but you can usually mess around with that by going into the settings. If you’re designing your greeting card from scratch, set it up so you can print it on one sheet of paper and then fold it in half. The size and the shape is up to you!"

[10] X Research source For instance, you might add balloons to a birthday card, flowers to a card you’re sending in the spring, or snowflakes for a card you’re sending in the winter.

[12] X Research source White paper is the easiest paper to use for your greeting card, but you could also mix it up by using some fun colors. If you don’t have a printer at home, visit a print shop to print out your card for a small fee."
