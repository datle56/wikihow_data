      "title": "Add 2-3 spoonfuls of starch to a paper-lined box and pat it down.",
      "content": "Add 2-3 spoonfuls of starch to a paper-lined box and pat it down. Empty your box of cornstarch into a bowl, get out an old cornstarch box, or use another paper-lined box (like an empty box of corn muffin mix). Then, add 2 to 3 heaping spoonfuls of cornstarch into the box. Tap the bottom of the box against your table or counter to pat down the starch and remove the air. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a paper-lined box : Stuff 3-4 brown paper bags inside of each other. Follow the same method and add 2-3 spoonfuls of starch to the bag at a time. [2] X Research source Use a cardboard can of cornstarch. Fill the container to the top with the cornstarch, adding 2-3 spoonfuls at a time using the same method. [3] X Research source Warning : Do not use a plastic container of cornstarch, as the plastic might melt during cooking and make the cornstarch unsafe. Note : While you may have heard that using a water bottle is a good way to make cornstarch chunks, it’s not a safe strategy. The plastic can melt during cooking."

      "title": "Keep adding cornstarch and packing it down until you’re out of starch.",
      "content": "Keep adding cornstarch and packing it down until you’re out of starch. The key to making cornstarch chunks is removing as much air in the box as possible. Continue adding 2 to 3 spoonfuls of cornstarch to the box or paper bag at a time. Then, tap it against your table to pack it down. [4] X Research source You don’t have to fill the box or bag completely full with cornstarch. Just stop when you’ve spooned all of your cornstarch into the box."

      "title": "Tamp down the cornstarch with your fist or a water glass.",
      "content": "Tamp down the cornstarch with your fist or a water glass. Use your fist to pack down the cornstarch inside the box or canister. Or, use a glass, water bottle, or other hard object that fits inside the container to tamp down the starch. [5] X Research source Press the cornstarch over and over to compact it and remove most of the air."

      "title": "Close the box or bag of cornstarch.",
      "content": "Close the box or bag of cornstarch. Fold the paper lining over the cornstarch, removing as much air as possible. Then, tear along the edges of the box and bend each side over the paper lining so the cornstarch is packaged up in a neat rectangle shape. [6] X Research source If you’re using a cardboard can, simply leave the top of the container open."

      "title": "Press the box with your hands or step on it.",
      "content": "Press the box with your hands or step on it. To ensure the cornstarch is super compact, squeeze the top and sides of the box with your hands. Use as much pressure as possible—it should take a bit of effort and elbow grease! Or, lay the box on the ground and step on it. [7] X Research source Gently press on the box to see if the cornstarch feels compact. If it feels soft and loose, keep squeezing or stepping on it until it feels hard and crunchy."

      "title": "Wrap the cornstarch in 2 layers of aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Wrap the cornstarch in 2 layers of aluminum foil. To protect the cornstarch from burning in the oven, cover the entire box or paper bag in 2 layers of aluminum foil. This also helps the cornstarch maintain its shape. [8] X Research source Squeeze or step on the cornstarch one last time to ensure it’s completely compacted. Remove any paper packaging on your container before wrapping it in aluminum foil. Warning: Do not use cardboard cans of cornstarch for this method. Some cans might contain metal, which can be unsafe to cook."

Then, set your timer for 1.5 hours and let the cornstarch bake and harden. [9] X Research source Keep watch on the cornstarch as it bakes to ensure it doesn’t burn. Just check it every 30 minutes or so. Place the cornstarch on a baking sheet or oven-safe pan, if you prefer."

      "content": "Let the cornstarch cool and place it in the freezer overnight. Take the cornstarch out of the oven, letting it cool down until it's safe to touch. Keep it wrapped in the aluminum foil and set it in your freezer to continue hardening overnight. [10] X Research source Placing the cooked cornstarch in your freezer helps it compact further and gives it a satisfying crunchy texture. For super crunchy cornstarch chunks, leave them in the freezer for 24 to 48 hours."

Your cornstarch should come out in a block or break apart into large pieces. Simply enjoy squeezing the cornstarch chunks with your fingers to hear the crunchy, ASMR sounds! Warning : While cornstarch is edible and safe to consume in small amounts, eating a lot can lead to stomach pain and intestinal blockages. [11] X Research source It’s generally not recommended to eat more than 1 to 2 tbsp (10-20 g), which is the average amount used in recipes. [12] X Research source"
