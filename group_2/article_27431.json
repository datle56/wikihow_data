      "content": "Mix together the oil dough. Combine 1 cup (250 ml) all-purpose flour with 1/3 cup (80 ml) vegetable oil, mixing until evenly combined into a smooth dough. If desired, you can also add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) red or yellow food coloring after combining the oil and flour. Mix until the color is even throughout the dough. The addition of food coloring is strictly optional, though. [1] X Research source Set the oil dough aside for now."

      "content": "Combine the flour and sugar for the water dough. Mix together 2 cups (500 ml) all-purpose flour with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) white granulated sugar in a medium bowl. Using a fork to mix the dry ingredients can minimize the number of lumps that may form in the flour."

      "content": "Cut in the lard. Add the chilled lard to your water dough and cut it into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter. [2] X Research source If you do not have a pastry cutter, cut the lard into small bits and sprinkle these bits over the dry ingredients evenly. Use a fork or knife to \"cut\" these lard bits into the dry ingredients until dry, coarse crumbs form."

      "title": "Knead well.",
      "content": "Knead well. Turn the water dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. If you did not add any food coloring, the dough should change from white to ivory after you knead it completely."

    {
      "title": "Divide and roll.",
      "content": "Divide and roll. Divide the dough into two equal halves, and roll each half into a flat square. The square of dough will be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long and wide. Roll the dough until it is only 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick, if not thinner. The thinness of the dough is more important than the shape or other dimensions at this point."

Wrap each portion of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10 to 60 minutes. [3] X Research source Refrigerating the dough will give the lard a chance to harden slightly, making the dough easier to work with when you assemble the hopia. Do not refrigerate it for much longer than an hour, though, since excessive refrigeration can cause the dough to dry out."

Note that kundol is also referred to as \"winter melon.\" The mashed filling should be chunky but somewhat watery at this point. If there is not much liquid in the pan, add 1/2 cup (125 ml) water."
