      "content": "Learn about the major categories of wine. Wine is primarily categorized into whites and reds. Other categories include rosés, sparkling wines, dessert wines, and fortified wines. The common types of wines that you would see on a restaurant menu or in a wine shop all belong to one of these categories—a Pinot Noir is a red wine, for instance, while a Chardonnay is a white wine. Here’s a quick guide to the different types of wines and their typical flavors: [19] X Research source White wine: Made from white grapes. Light, crisp, citrusy, fruity, and floral. Red wine: Made from black grapes. Rich, darkly fruity, earthy, spicy. Rosé: Made from black grapes but with a shorter contact time. Light, bright, refreshing, fruity, acidic. Sparkling wine: Wine infused with carbon dioxide for a fizzy texture. Often citrusy, fruity, and nutty. Includes popular wines like prosecco, champagne, and cava. Dessert wine: Sweet wines that are often paired with a dessert course. Includes port, moscato, ice wine, mead, and tokaji eszencia. Fortified wine: Wine that has a distilled spirit (like brandy) added to it. Often served before or after a meal. Includes sherry, port, madeira, marsala, and vermouth. Wines can also be categorized as light , medium , or full-bodied , which refers to their overall feel and intensity in the mouth, or as dry , medium , or sweet , which describes the amount of sugar in the wine."

      "content": "Always try different varieties of wine. Drink a new wine every time you’re picking out a bottle at the store, ordering a glass at a restaurant, or choosing a selection at a wine tasting. Experiment with different grapes, regions, blends, and brands and observe your feelings about each one. Try to evaluate what it is about each wine that you like (or dislike), and see if there are any patterns amongst your favorite and least favorite wines. [20] X Research source “Being open to trying different wines is very important,” says Perng. “Not tasting enough wine or not tasting a variety of wines is probably one of the biggest [errors]” made when learning about wine."

      "title": "Take notes and ask questions about the wines you try.",
      "content": "Take notes and ask questions about the wines you try. Create a Notes page in your phone, use a tracking app like Vivino , or start a designated wine tasting journal to keep track of your wine journey. Take note of the name of each wine you try, as well as the brand, region, blend, and any other tasting details. If you’re at a bar or wine shop, ask the staff for more information about the wine, like what grapes were used and which winemaking techniques were applied. [21] X Research source Then, note how you felt about the wine and whether there were certain aspects of it that you liked or disliked. If you use an app like Vivino to learn about and track your wines, avoid relying too much on each wine’s rating on the app. Wine preferences are highly subjective, so someone else’s one-star bottle may be your absolute favorite!"

      "content": "Attend wine tastings or organize your own. Travel to local wineries from time to time and keep an eye out for restaurants and bars hosting smaller-scale wine tastings in your area. Attending wine tastings gives you an opportunity to try new wines and pose questions to experienced sommeliers. [22] X Research source If visiting wineries isn’t a realistic option for location or budgetary reasons, you can host your own tastings at home! Consider joining a wine club in your town or city, or organizing a monthly wine tasting night with your friends or family! “The most important thing [to do] is really doing wine tasting,” affirms Perng. “You can read a lot but, as much as you’re able to read, it’s never going to tell you exactly how wine tastes. You have to taste for yourself if you really want to understand what a wine tastes like and why it tastes the way it does.” “So, I would say that just tasting with friends very consistently is always helpful,” continues Perng. “Even most of us sommeliers still taste very consistently. I have a weekly…wine tasting group that I joined, and it’s great to be constantly improving your palate and trying wine. The more you taste, the more you know.”"

      "title": "Sample a single vineyard production or try a higher price point.",
      "content": "Sample a single vineyard production or try a higher price point. Single vineyard production means that all of the grapes used for the wine in the bottle are from one plot (rather than a combination of several plots). Trying this type of wine can help you better understand the nuances of wine production as you continue to expand your palate. [23] X Research source Another way to level up is by trying more expensive wines. But, of course, that begs the essential question: are expensive wines worth it? Most wine lovers would probably argue that higher-priced wines are worth the higher cost—but only if you fully understand and enjoy that wine. If you aren’t knowledgeable enough about wine to appreciate the subtleties of a splurge-worthy one, then it may not be worth the cost to you personally. [24] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn about and explore different wine regions. Wines come from different regions all over the world—from California to France to Argentina—and each one has a distinct taste and flavor due to climate, terrain, and traditional winemaking practices. Explore different wines from different regions, as well as different varieties of wine within the same region. If you know you love a certain grape from one region, try it again from another region to see if you like it just as much. [25] X Research source If you’ve found that you really love a certain wine region, consider saving up for a vacation to that wine country! Not only will you get the opportunity to sample more wines, but you’ll also be able to physically explore the culture and speak with local sommeliers who make your favorite bottles. All of these factors will deeply influence how you understand and taste wine. Perng explains how the “major wine regions are Europe,which is the Old World, and the New World—the US, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, etc. All of these places have different winemaking processes and different pieces of legislation and governmental legislation, all of which affects the way that the wine turns out.” “Understanding everything that goes into winemaking,” continues Perng, “is very important if you want to get into wine. It will really explain to you how those flavors come out and you’ll be more knowledgeable about what flavors you should be expecting.”"

      "content": "Learning the so-called “proper” wine etiquette can be a daunting task—especially if you’re a beginner to drinking wine in general! While there’s no wrong way to drink wine , certain practices can help to enhance the flavors of your glass—and make it easier for you to pick up on the nuances and notes of any given bottle. Below, you’ll find some quick steps to drink wine like a pro: [26] X Research source Decant your wine ahead of time. Certain wines (like full-bodied reds) should be decanted to separate the juice from the sediment. Let the wine sit in the decanter for 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the type. Use the right glass. Drink red wine out of a long-stemmed, clear glass with a rounded bottom and wider top. Drink white wine out of a glass with a narrower cup and tapered top. Hold the wine glass correctly . Pinch the stem between your thumb, index, and middle fingers, and rest your ring and pinky fingers on the base of the glass. Observe the wine for color and clarity . Start off with just looking at the wine, instructs Pogue. Hold your wine glass against a white background and examine its color and clarity. Tilt the glass and watch how the color changes from the center to the edges. Swirl and smell the aromas of the wine. Swirl the glass gently to release the aromas, then bring the glass up to your nose. Take short, quick sniffs and identify different scents (e.g., fruits, flowers, spices, etc.). Give it a nice slow inhale with your mouth open, says Pogue. Take a small taste of the wine. Sip a small amount of the wine and let it coat your entire mouth. Observe the taste on your tongue, palate, and throat, taking note of its body, acidity, and tannins. Consider how long the flavors linger in your mouth. Evaluate the wine and whether you like it. Consider the overall flavor, balance, complexity, and quality of the wine. Finally, decide whether or not you enjoy the wine!"

      "content": "Wine-talk is practically its own language, so before you dive into all of the best beginner-friendly wines, we’ll make sure you know all of the terms to understand and discuss wine like a pro. Here are some of the most important wine terms that we’ll use throughout this article: [27] X Research source Acidity: Every wine has some level of acidity which creates a balance between sweet and bitter. A more acidic wine will be slightly more bitter, while a less acidic wine will be sweeter. High acidity can also affect whether a wine tastes crisp or fresh. Aroma: A wine’s aroma refers to the wine’s smell, although the term bouquet may also be used—particularly for aged wines. Aromas are often described as fruity or floral, and they may be distinct from the wine’s flavor profile. Body: The body of a wine refers to the feel or weight of a wine in the mouth. Wines are categorized as light, medium, or heavy-bodied. Light-bodied wines feel thin in the mouth, while heavy-bodied wines feel heavier or fuller. Sweet vs. Dry: Terms like “sweet” and “dry” refer to the amount of sugar in a wine. A dry wine has almost no residual sugar and a sour or bitter taste, while a sweet wine has a high amount of sugar and a sweet taste. Tannins: These are natural compounds found in grape skins, seeds, and stems. They give structure to wine but also leave a bitter, dry, and astringent taste in the mouth. As a result, wines with low tannins are typically more suitable for beginner wine drinkers."
