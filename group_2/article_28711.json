      "content": "Slide the pops into an upside-down colander for an easy-to-clean option. One of the easiest ways to prop up your cake pops is to simply slide the sticks through the holes of an upside-down colander. This is a great option if you're using a nicer stand to display your cake pops, but you're worried that the pops will drip as they're cooling. Just rinse the colander when you're finished! [1] X Research source Don't use every hole in the colander. Instead, try to space the cake pops out so they have at least 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) between them."

      "content": "Pierce holes in an upside-down egg carton for an easy alternative. If you need a quick holder for your cake pops, check your fridge to see if you have an egg carton you can use. If you do, flip it upside-down, then push a stick through each egg dome. When you're finished, just prop the sticks in the holes! [2] X Research source If you'd like to use the egg carton as a display, try decorating it with paint or craft paper first!"

      "content": "Fill a wide-mouth jar with candies or coffee beans. Choose a candy that complements the flavors or colors of your cake pops, and pour them into a pretty jar with a wide opening. Fill the jar almost all the way to the top, then push the cake pop sticks down into the candy to display them. Try using jelly beans for brightly-colored or fruity-flavored cake pops, for instance, or try coffee beans to complement sophisticated dark chocolate pops. Use an array of different jars and candies if you're making a lot of cake pops!"

      "content": "Make your own cake stand by drilling holes into a piece of wood. If you'd like a more permanent cake stand, find a piece of wood that's at least 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) thick. Then, make a mark on a 5 ⁄ 32 in (0.40 cm) drill bit at about the 1 in (2.5 cm). Drill a series of holes spaced about 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) apart, using the mark on the bit to make sure you don't drill too deep. [3] X Research source If you'd prefer, you can make an upright stand by attaching a tall piece of wood to a base, then drilling holes down the sides. A board with pre-drilled holes, like a cribbage board, may work as well. Be sure to wear safety goggles when you're working with power tools!"

      "content": "Decorate a box or a basket if you want to use one. While you can just use a piece of foam as your cake pop holder, the finished design will be sturdier and more attractive if you fit the foam into a basket or box. If you choose to use either one, you can decorate it with ribbon, craft paper, or other elements that match your cake pop design. For instance, if your cake pops are pink and purple, you might use a pink-and-purple striped ribbon around the outside of your basket. If your cake pops are Valentine's themed, you might decoupage your box with heart-covered paper, or you could glue heart-shaped candies to the box. When you're planning the size of your holder, keep in mind that you'll need to space your cake pops about 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) apart."

      "content": "Cut your styrofoam to fit snugly in the basket or box. If you're displaying the cake pops in a box or basket, cut the styrofoam block so it fits inside the top of the container. First, measure the size you'll need and mark the styrofoam with a pen. Then, carefully slice through the foam with a craft knife. [4] X Research source If you're not using a box or basket, or if your foam is already the right size, there's no need to cut it. If you don't already have foam on hand, you can pick up styrofoam blocks or floral foam from most craft supply stores. For best results, use foam that's at least 1 in (2.5 cm) thick."

      "content": "Wrap the styrofoam neatly in tissue paper. Lay the styrofoam block on 2 pieces of tissue paper stacked together. Then, wrap the styrofoam the same way you would wrap a present . Fold the paper over the styrofoam and tape it down, then neatly fold the ends of the paper and tape them down as well. [5] X Research source Try picking a tissue paper color that will complement the decor on your cake pops! You can also use craft paper, if you'd prefer, or you could paint the blocks with acrylic paint. Make the design your own! [6] X Research source"

Make sure it's seated snugly, since if it shifts later on, it could mess up your beautiful cake pops! [8] X Research source If you'd like, you can just use the wrapped foam as your holder, without using a box or a basket. If your foam isn't thick enough to fill the whole box, try placing something in the bottom of the box to stabilize the cake pops, like balled-up tissue paper, dried beans, or even upside-down disposable foam cups.

Just push each stick down through the tissue paper and into the foam by about 1 in (2.5 cm). That should provide enough stability so the cake pops won't fall over in your stand. [10] X Research source Space the cake pops about 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) apart so they won't touch each other. If you need to, you can angle them slightly away from each other to fit more pops onto the foam. If you used a heavier paper, like scrapbook or wrapping paper, you may need to use a craft knife to punch holes for the sticks first. [11] X Research source"
