      "content": "Cut your vegetable into 2 in (5 cm) chunks. To start, wash the vegetables you’d like to julienne and slice off the ends. Then, cut the vegetables into smaller chunks with a chef's knife —this helps give julienned vegetables their short, matchstick shape. [1] X Research source Peel your veggies ahead of time if they’re root veggies (like carrots or beets)."

      "title": "Slice off the rounded sides of the vegetable to square it off.",
      "content": "Slice off the rounded sides of the vegetable to square it off. Place the veggie segments upright on your cutting surface. If your vegetable has rounded edges (like a carrot or zucchini), cut thin slices off the edges to give it a more rectangular shape. This helps the julienne matchsticks to look more uniform and straight.

      "content": "Cut the veggie down its length into thin, ⅛ in (3 mm) thick slabs. Set the vegetable segments horizontally on your cutting board. Then, cut down the veggie lengthwise, creating thin, ⅛ in (3 mm) pieces that resemble planks.

      "content": "Stack the planks and slice them into ⅛ in (3 mm) thin matchsticks. Horizontally stack the vegetable planks on top of one another. Then, start cutting through this stack in thin, ⅛ in (3 mm) thick matchstick slices. You’ve now successfully julienned your vegetable! [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice into the vegetable at a steep angle.",
      "content": "Slice into the vegetable at a steep angle. Take a chef knife and cut into the vegetable at a 45-degree angle or higher—the steeper the angle, the longer your julienned sticks will be. [6] X Research source Be sure to wash the vegetable ahead of time and slice off the ends. If you’re working with a root vegetable like a beet or carrot, take a moment to peel it. Home chefs find that this julienning method works best with veggies that are on the cylindrical side rather than rounded veggies."

      "content": "Cut thin, ⅛ in (3 mm) thick slabs on angle. Continue slicing the vegetable at this same angle, creating thin, uniform slices as you go. These slices will appear longer and ovular than a typical round vegetable slice. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice the vegetable slabs into thin, ⅛ in (3 mm) matchsticks.",
      "content": "Slice the vegetable slabs into thin, ⅛ in (3 mm) matchsticks. Place the sliced veggies down so they’re flat on your cutting surface. Then, vertically slice down each veggie slab, creating thin, ⅛ in (3 mm) matchsticks. [8] X Research source This method is great if you’re hoping to save some time since it doesn’t require you to square off your veggies ahead of time."
