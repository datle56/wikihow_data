      "title": "Choose a bikini if you are an hourglass shape.",
      "content": "Choose a bikini if you are an hourglass shape. An hourglass figure is characterized by defined waist with a nearly equal bust and hip measurement. A bikini draws attention to your curves, while further emphasizing your trim middle section. If you have a larger bust, consider going with a top with a bit more coverage. [1] X Research source Avoid wearing a mismatched bikini pair, as it could throw off your body’s proportions. If you go with a two-piece, make it the same color and pattern. With an hourglass figure, you have multiple options when choosing bikini bottoms. You can go with the traditional bikini cut or with a Brazilian style, which cuts a bit higher on the bottom. To choose a flattering one-piece for an hourglass shape, look for a top with thin straps and sweetheart neckline."

      "title": "Choose a bandeau swimsuit if you are a triangle shape.",
      "content": "Choose a bandeau swimsuit if you are a triangle shape. A triangle figure is characterized by a larger hip and thigh measurement with a smaller bust. A bandeau top is a great option, as it can show off a toned upper body. If you are concerned about carrying too much weight in your lower half, a darker pair of boy shorts can minimize attention to that area. [2] X Research source With a triangle shape, you can go with either traditional bikini bottoms or a pair of boy shorts. To choose a one-piece, look for a strapless top that tapers down to a bottom with more coverage."

      "title": "Choose a halter-suit if you are an inverted triangle shape.",
      "content": "Choose a halter-suit if you are an inverted triangle shape. If you have broad shoulders and a larger bust with small hips, then you have an inverted triangle figure. Look for a top that provides plenty of support in the style of a halter or strong underwire. This will support your bust and make it look more streamlined and thin. [3] X Research source With an inverted triangle shape, you can go with traditional bikini or Brazilian bottoms, if you choose. The smaller cut can show off your toned lower body. These principles can be applied to both one-piece and two-piece suits. The goal is to look for support for the top and less coverage on the bottom."

      "title": "Choose a suit with an asymmetrical neckline if you are an “apple” shape.",
      "content": "Choose a suit with an asymmetrical neckline if you are an “apple” shape. People with “apple” shaped figures sport broad shoulders with thicker waist areas. A swimsuit that is held up by a single, angling shoulder strap makes the waist look slimmer by drawing the eye upwards. Look for a traditional or boy shorts bottom. This advice holds true for one-piece and two-piece suits. If you carry considerable weight in a particular area, such as your waist, then try to find a suit that provides comfortable coverage."

      "title": "Choose a suit with embellishments if you are a rectangular shape.",
      "content": "Choose a suit with embellishments if you are a rectangular shape. People with rectangular figures usually have nearly equal bust and hip measurements with less defined waists. To create the appearance of a slim and trim waist, look for suits with ruffles, ribbons, or other attention-grabbing items on the top and/or bottom. [4] X Research source You can choose both one-piece and two-piece suits with these types of embellishments. However, if you go with a one-piece, choose one that includes a belt for your waist or cut-outs in the middle area. In this case, you can really choose any style of bottoms from bikini to boy shorts."

      "title": "Choose a good color.",
      "content": "Choose a good color. Dark colors tend to be the most figure flattering. If you go with a black or deep blue suit, it will create a solid silhouette. \"Color blocking” suits that feature darker panels, or cut-outs, can also create a curvier or slimmer figure. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with flattering lines.",
      "content": "Go with flattering lines. Thin horizontal lines can create the illusion of an hourglass figure. Thin vertical lines are even better if you would like to appear taller and slimmer. While thick vertical lines are figure flattering, it’s best to avoid wide horizontal lines, as they can make your torso look wider, too. [6] X Research source Avoid wide vertical lines, as they will make your suit look like an athletic jersey. You can also mix-and-match swimsuit separates. Pairing a solid bottom with a striped top with enhance the look of your bust."

      "title": "Look for smaller prints.",
      "content": "Look for smaller prints. Large geometric prints or big floral patterns are not as figure flattering. However, small prints or patterns will help to create a streamlined figure. Polka dots, for example, are a very flattering minimalist print. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for ruching and texture.",
      "content": "Look for ruching and texture. Ruching or fabric gathers on a suit can create the appearance of a slimmer waist, if the ruching appears on the middle torso of the suit. A swimsuit with all-over textured fabric layers can also draw attention away from your torso."

    {
      "title": "Choose a suit with shapewear.",
      "content": "Choose a suit with shapewear. These suits contain an extra inner liner that streamlines your silhouette. A suit with shapewear is also a good option if you want to be active in a suit, while also looking slim. You can expect to pay a bit more for suits that feature extra support features, such as shapewear. You can also purchase a suit with a strong underwire if you have a larger bust. You can even apply waterproof medical tape across their cleavage (hidden under the suit) to create additional lift."

      "title": "Get the right size or inseam.",
      "content": "Get the right size or inseam. Your suit should fit snugly without any loose areas or gaps between your skin and the fabric. Look at yourself in a mirror from a variety of angles to make sure that your skin isn’t spilling over anywhere either. If you are 5’6” (167cm) or shorter, choose shorts with a 6 inches (15 cm) or less inseam to create the illusion of more height. If you are taller than 5’6” (167cm), go with an inseam that measures over 6 inches (15 cm)."

      "content": "Go with slim-fit trunks. A trunk with a slim-cut will hang close to your body without being tight or constricting. They will give you a slimmer, more tailored appearance. In contrast, loose-fitting trunks can billow out and add pounds to your frame."

      "content": "Choose a suit with support mesh. This is an extra layer of contoured mesh under swim shorts that can create a smooth silhouette. Both loose-fitting and slim-fit trunks are sold with a mesh underlayer. Make sure to try on your shorts before buying them, as you may not like the feel of mesh against your skin."

      "content": "Buy trunks with ties. Swim shorts with a flat front secured by a zipper and ties are flattering to almost every man’s figure. They make the front of your body look toned and solid. You also don’t have to worry about any buttons opening or hook-and-loop fastener coming undone with tie shorts."

      "content": "Look for a line on the outer thigh. This is the masculine version of swimsuit color-blocking. You can do a lighter color pair of shorts with a dark, thick line on the outer thigh areas. Or, you can do a darker pair with a lighter line. The line helps to elongate your silhouette and makes you look slimmer. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a rash guard shirt.",
      "content": "Wear a rash guard shirt. If you aren’t comfortable stepping out shirtless or if you’d like more protection from the sun, try wearing a rash guard top. This is a type of shirt that is made out of thin material that quickly dries when wet. To flatter your figure, select a shirt that is neither too tight nor too loose. The material should just skim the edges of your skin when worn. Rash guard shirts come in a wide variety of colors and cuts to mix and match with your trunks."

      "title": "Wear a wrap.",
      "content": "Wear a wrap. Get a light, dark colored swimsuit cover-up and tie it around your waist in a loose knot. Or, put on a sheer cover-up that resembles a beach dress, but is designed to get wet. These looks give the appearance of casual style. They are also far more slimming than a beach towel wrapped around your waist. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a contour spray tan.",
      "content": "Get a contour spray tan. You can go to a professional and get a spray tan. Or, you can do it yourself with a self-tanning kit. Just make sure that you go just a few shades darker than your natural skin tone. If you get too extreme, you might end up with wrinkly or orange looking skin. If you are applying a self-tanner, make sure to read the package instructions carefully. You’ll likely need to hold the bottle at an angle to get the best coverage. A custom contour tan works by creating the illusion of shadows and highlights across your body. If you choose to go to a salon and get a professional spray tan, ask the technician for a skin patch test to make sure the color is what you will be happy with and won't turn your skin orange."

      "title": "Stand up straight.",
      "content": "Stand up straight. When you are walking in a swimsuit, keep your shoulders back and your head held high. If you are sitting down, pull your knees toward your chest. This creates the illusion of a slimmer stomach and trimmer thighs."

      "title": "Try a dramatic hat.",
      "content": "Try a dramatic hat. Choose a hat that is an appropriate match for your swimwear. For a bohemian print, you might go with a straw hat. A hat will draw the eye upwards. It will also keep the sun out of your eyes. Even better, put your hair up into a bun or ponytail under your hat. This elongates your neck and makes you look slimmer overall. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Get in shape",
      "content": "Get in shape . Try to work out at least 5 times a week, mixing in both cardio and weight training sessions. This will help to tone your body and make you look slimmer in your suit. It even helps to do a quick 30 minute work-out right before putting on your suit, as your muscles will stay activated for around 5 hours. Hula hooping is a very effective exercise for anyone looking to trim down their middle section prior to wearing a swimsuit. Try to do an hour-long session, 3 times a week."

      "title": "Eat healthy",
      "content": "Eat healthy . Eat small meals that keep your metabolism running high. Pack your meals with lots of fresh produce, whole grains, and healthy fats. To trim down even further, avoid bloat-causing foods for 10 days prior to putting on a swimsuit. Beans, broccoli, spinach, and starchy foods can all cause unflattering bloating. Reducing your salt intake can help as well."
