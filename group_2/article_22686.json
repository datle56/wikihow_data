      "content": "Hinge profiles ask users to answer 3 prompts. Unlike competing dating apps, Hinge segues from traditional “About Me” bios by giving you the option to choose from a list of unique open-ended questions. How you answer the question is entirely up to you, as you can stick with a typed sentence or try a video or voice response. Answer prompts like these to show off your personality: “Two truths and a lie.” “I’m looking for…” “My most irrational fear.”"

Along with displaying basic profile features such as age, Bumble profiles also show a basic “About Me” section and 3 short answer prompts. The “About Me” bio on Bumble must be 300 characters or less, while prompt answers must be 120 characters or less."

Rather than swiping left or right on a potential partner, Hinge users like profiles. The Discover feed shows users who match your algorithm and curates a group of Standouts that Hinge thinks you're most compatible with. [5] X Research source Regular users can like up to 8 people a day; anymore requires a premium subscription. A profile must be liked or passed to view the next. Users can comment on any part of another user’s profile, such as a photo or prompt, to initiate a conversation."

If you see someone you like on your feed, swipe right or “Vote.” If you don’t like someone, you swipe left to view the next profile. This swiping method is standard for dating apps today and can give users a sense of familiarity, especially when trying a new platform. Regular users can “vote” or swipe right about 100 times a day; unlimited swiping requires a premium subscription."

This female-friendly approach sets Bumble apart from other dating apps and helps cut down unwanted advances on women. The woman’s first message must be sent within 24 hours of the match, or the match expires. Men also have 24 hours to respond to the first message; otherwise, the conversation expires. In same-gender matches, either person can start the conversation."
