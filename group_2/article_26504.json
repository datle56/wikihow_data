However, this does not mean that you should starve yourself. Starving yourself causes your metabolism—the process by which your body burns fat—to slow down dramatically so that it can store up energy. You won't lose weight, and you might even gain it. [1] X Expert Source Pouya Shafipour, MD, MS Board Certified Family Medicine Specialist Expert Interview. 24 April 2020. It is important to remember that your body is changing as a result of hormone fluctuations. It is natural to experience some weight fluctuation as well.

This is a healthier choice than sugary soft drinks and artificial juice. Try adding a few slices of lemon to your water. It will get rid of the toxins in your body. Drink as much water as you can, as often as you can. A minimum of 3 servings of fruit daily. A minimum of 4 servings of vegetables daily 3 – 7 servings of protein: (meat, fish, etc.) and dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.) daily 3 – 5 servings of healthy fats: (nuts, peanut butter, avocado, etc.) daily [5] X Research source Eat simple carbohydrates (refined and processed products including muffins, cakes, cereals, white bread, white pasta) sparingly.

Breakfast Ideas: Toast with your favorite spread. Bananas are high in potassium. Try cereal with skimmed milk and fruit. Lunch Ideas: It's best to bring your lunch from home. School food can be unhealthy, and you probably don't have much choice over what there is to eat. Try a sandwich on wholegrain/whole wheat/multi-grain bread with lean chicken, ham, or a butter-fried egg (using butter to fry egg instead of oil). Don't use white bread – it's made from bleached flour, and it contains very few nutrients. Add a salad with veggies (tomato, cucumber, lettuce, etc); a glass of milk; and veggie snacks like carrot sticks and celery. Snack Ideas: veggies and fruit; natural yogurt and berries; a handful of nuts; veggies (like carrots, beans, snow peas) and low-fat dip. Do not buy yogurt-coated or chocolate-coated raisins or nuts. Most of these are full of added sugar. [6] X Research source Dinner Ideas: One idea is: 1/2 veggies, 1/4 protein, 1/4 carbohydrates. If your parents make fatty foods for dinner, only have a little, then make yourself a salad on the side. If you're cooking for yourself: make brown rice (eating more lean meat than part carbohydrates helps); scrambled eggs; make yourself a sandwich; or eat some fish (it's high in omega-3, which is good for your brain)."

Just think: almost half your daily calories in one drink! Water is healthy, it tastes good, and it's an essential part of keeping you trim. If you find yourself consistently hungry after every meal: try drinking a big glass of water or green tea (unsweetened) before you eat. It'll help fill you up, and it doesn't contain any extra calories. To burn more calories, drink ice-cold water. Your body will spend more energy warming it up. A glass of cold water also feels refreshing after lots of exercise."

[9] X Research source As exceptions: try to cut out fast food, sweets (chocolate, candy, chips, soda, etc.), and other junk food (soft drinks, burgers, ice cream, etc.) Avoid the strategy of allowing yourself one \"cheat day\" per week , as this can lead to one day of binging. Try setting one day each week when you can have a small treat after dinner. If this is too difficult for you, then start with a small treat after dinner every day, and slowly switch to one day. Although you can have it at any time of the day, it's better to have it after dinner because you can look forward to it all day. Fast food and sweets are highly processed, fatty, and unhealthy. McDonald's soft serves are made from pig fat, KFC fries are fried in lard, and thick-shakes contain almost no natural ingredients! It's all preservatives and additives.

Your body runs on glucose (carbohydrates) in order to function. Carbohydrates translate into energy. Unless you want to become lethargic, fatigued, and eventually gain more weight back, don't cut out carbs. Cutting out carbs completely, especially during this stage of life, can slow brain function and hormone production. Don't fall into the trap of the low-carb Atkins diet. This diet recommends that you eat high-protein meats and fish that are high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Consuming too much animal protein (eggs, butter, chicken, fish, yogurt, milk, beef, lamb, pork, turkey etc.) have been linked to increased rates of heart disease and cancer."
