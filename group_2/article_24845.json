      "title": "Weigh down your lid.",
      "content": "Weigh down your lid. For an easy solution, simply place a heavy rock or cinder block on top of your lid. Just make sure everyone who needs access to the can is strong enough to lift it (besides raccoons, of course)!"

      "title": "Pick a locking metal trash can.",
      "content": "Pick a locking metal trash can. A flimsy or loose can won’t stand up to a cunning raccoon. Choose a metal trash can with a locking lid. While some plastic cans can lock, raccoons are often able to chew through plastic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Install an extra lock (or two).",
      "content": "Install an extra lock (or two). Attaching clamps, a chain-and-padlock combo, bungee cords, or specially designed garbage-lid straps are all good strategies to keep your lid secure from intruders. Don’t hesitate to use multiple locking mechanisms. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal each trash bag.",
      "content": "Seal each trash bag. Tightly sealing trash bags before putting them in your can will help prevent tempting scents from escaping. If a trash bag contains an especially smelly item--such as a piece of meat--try sealing it with an extra bag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure your can upright with stakes.",
      "content": "Secure your can upright with stakes. Oftentimes, raccoons open trash cans by tipping them and spilling their contents. Tie the handles of your trash can to a metal or wooden stake secured in the ground to keep raccoons from tipping them over."

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle a raccoon repellent around your trash cans.",
      "content": "Sprinkle a raccoon repellent around your trash cans. Specifically designed commercial repellents can ward off raccoons from even entering the vicinity of your can. Try granular products such as Havahart Critter Ridder, or liquids such as Just Scentsational synthetic wolf urine. [2] X Research source Avoid using naphthalene (the active ingredient in mothballs), as it has been identified as a possible carcinogen by the EPA. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use ammonia.",
      "content": "Use ammonia. Ammonia smells like raccoon urine, making it a highly offensive--and highly effective--repellent. Try spraying ammonia or placing ammonia-soaked cloths in and around your trash can. Additionally, you can spray other areas of your property where raccoons seem to congregate to discourage them from entering your yard in the first place. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use natural raccoon-repellant spices and oils.",
      "content": "Use natural raccoon-repellant spices and oils. Racoons hate the smell of many commonly available spices and oils, including mint, cayenne pepper, and oil of mustard. Try spraying or sprinkling any (or all) of these items in and around your can for additional protection. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put your bin behind closed doors.",
      "content": "Put your bin behind closed doors. Keeping your trash cans in a shed, garage, basement or other enclosure will surely prevent overnight pillages; racoons simply cannot open doors. If you need to leave trash out for pickup, wait until the morning to remove your cans from their haven; raccoons tend only to strike at night."

    {
      "title": "Turn up the radio.",
      "content": "Turn up the radio. Keeping a radio on constantly around your cans will help deter raccoons. The noise of human voices (such as though from a news or talk station) will scare off the furry burglars. Try a low volume at first, and turn it up if your raccoon problems persist.

    },
    {
      "title": "Turn on the lights.",
      "content": "Turn on the lights. Install motion-detection lighting around the area where you keep your trash cans. Raccoons prefer darkness and might be deterred by a sudden bright light. For an easier solution, simply install a strand of blinking Christmas lights over the trashcan. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Bolster your fences.",
      "content": "Bolster your fences. If you have a fenced yard, consider adding mesh wire to the bottom of the fence and extending it several inches underground to deter raccoons from burrowing under and getting to your trash cans."
