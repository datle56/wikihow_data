      "content": "Make a mark halfway down the plastic bottle. About 4 inches (10 cm) from the lid of the 2 liter bottle is about half of the bottle. You can use a ruler or measuring tape to find where 4 inches down the bottle is. Extend the tape measure 4 inches. Hold the end of the tape up to the end of the bottle’s lid. Using your pen, make a mark where the tape measure ends; this is 4 inches."

      "content": "Draw a circle around the bottle 4 inches from the lid. You will be cutting the plastic bottle in half. The measurements here do not need to be exact, but drawing a marked guide line will be helpful. Using the pen mark you just drew as a guide, draw a circle around the bottle 4 inches down from the lid. This will guide you in cutting the bottle in half."

      "title": "Cut the plastic bottle in half.",
      "content": "Cut the plastic bottle in half. Cut carefully along your marked guide line until the bottle is in two sections. Keep both parts of the bottle; you'll use them both to make the trap. Be careful of sharp plastic edges as you cut. The edges don’t have to be perfect, so don’t worry if you’re a bit off from the marked guide line."

Ensure the top of the bottle is above the water line. Adult mosquito should have enough room to fly in the bottle and down the lid. If there is not enough room for them to fly in the bottle, empty a bit of the solution out. Now, insects can fly into the trap and die from suffocation or starvation."

Eventually, many mosquitos will die in the bottle, and you will have to clean the trap for it to be effective again. Even if there are not many mosquitos, the liquid in the trap eventually loses its effectiveness because all the yeast has finished eating the sugar and no longer attracts mosquitos; many sources say this takes two weeks. [4] X Research source Use a calendar to keep track of when you will need to change the liquid. Change the liquid when the bottle is full of insects, even if two weeks have not passed."
