      "content": "Ask your doctor about starting an endurance exercise program. Recent studies have linked endurance training with an increase in blood volume over time. Thus, committing to an endurance exercise routine is one of the simplest ways to naturally increase your blood volume. The blood volume increase produced by exercise improves exercise performance and cardiovascular fitness. However, make sure to check with your doctor first. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Consider engaging in a cardio workout regularly. For instance, run, walk, swim, or cycle 3 to 5 times a week for 30 minutes to 1 hour – or even longer. Your cardio program should last months rather than weeks, and it also needs to be maintained to maintain the increased blood volume. Studies have shown that red blood cell volume increases after about 2 to 4 weeks. Thus, you’ll likely see best results after 1 to 2 months of cardio.
