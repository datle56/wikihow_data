    {
      "title": "Make sure you have some form of relationship.",
      "content": "Make sure you have some form of relationship. Being friends is an excellent way to get to know someone without it being awkward. If you’re not already friends, take some time to get to know them better. Observations can be great conversation starters. You might say, \"I love the way you match the colors in your outfit.\" [1] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 13 July 2021."

    {
      "title": "Touch them, but not in an inappropriate way.",
      "content": "Touch them, but not in an inappropriate way. There are all kinds of ways you can initiate physical touch with the person you like. Bump them gently in the hall, or maybe “accidentally” slide your hand over theirs. Just make sure they don’t seem uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Show them you appreciate their sense of humor.",
      "content": "Show them you appreciate their sense of humor. Even if they are corny, people like it when someone enjoys their jokes. However, be careful about laughing too much! It will make you appear false and it could get annoying. A small chuckle or giggle will do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Offer them to help with homework or other problems.",
      "content": "Offer them to help with homework or other problems. Helping someone out forms a mental bond that is often mistaken as love. This is obviously a bit manipulative for you to know this while the other person doesn't, but it does work very well. Still, if you'd prefer not using manipulation to meet your goals, you could always drop this fact with the \"Hey, did you know...\" method. Not only would it hint towards your interest in an innocent, non-creepy way, but it would also form an opinion of you as a knowledgeable person."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try hanging out and doing things you both enjoy.",
      "content": "Try hanging out and doing things you both enjoy. Get involved with their life by asking if they play any sports, what hobbies they have, or what music they like, and suggest you do something related to those interests. For example, ask them when and where their next game is. Try planning a group party, with some of your friends and some of their friends. Anything that will get you talking outside the school, go for it. You can also ask for their phone number or email address. Wait a little bit before contacting them, and when you do call or email, make it quick and not too awkward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t even tune them out.",
      "content": "Don’t even tune them out. People love when someone listens, so show them you care what they have to say. Make eye contact, nod along, and ask follow-up questions related to what they’re telling you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make them feel special.",
      "content": "Make them feel special. If they get a haircut, say it’s wonderful. If they got a new shirt, say it looks nice. Everyone loves compliments. Remember to compliment things other than their looks, like their personality and talents!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep things casual.",
      "content": "Keep things casual. Don’t overdo it; don’t dress in fancy clothing or play romantic music. For better results, ask if they want to stay for dinner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask when you’re alone so you don’t embarrass them.",
      "content": "Ask when you’re alone so you don’t embarrass them. Pull them aside and say something like, \"I heard a rumor spreading that you like me. Is that true? Tell me the truth, I won't be upset.\" This is sometimes good, sometimes bad, so be prepared for their answer either way."
    },
    {
      "title": "This may feel less awkward if you’re shy.",
      "content": "This may feel less awkward if you’re shy. This way, they’ll know how you feel and you don’t have to stress yourself out trying to work up the nerve to tell them yourself. Or, consider just passing them a note saying that you like them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang around them with your friends or alone.",
      "content": "Hang around them with your friends or alone. The more you’re around them, the more you’ll find out about them and vice versa. This also means there’s a higher chance they’ll start to like you back if they don’t already! Have a friend eavesdrop a bit on them when you leave the room, to see if they say anything about you when you're out of range."
