      "content": "Know the layout of a beacon. A beacon is, at minimum, a three-by-three, one-block high square base of at least iron blocks (though gold, diamond, emerald and/or netherite blocks will also do) with a beacon unit placed on top of it. If you want to enhance your beacon's power and range, you'll need an additional square base of five by five, seven by seven, and nine by nine per power level, respectively. Creating a beacon can be a tedious process, since you need a bare minimum of 81 iron ingots to craft the base alone."

      "content": "Gather the necessary materials. To craft a beacon, you will need the following items: [1] X Research source At least 81 iron ore - Mine a lot of iron ore—which is the grey stone with orange spots—with a stone pickaxe or better. You can use emeralds, gold, or diamonds instead, but these minerals are far rarer than iron and their effect on the beacon is the same anyway. Three blocks of obsidian - Obsidian is formed by water hitting lava from above. You can find it deep in caves. You will need a diamond pickaxe to mine obsidian. Five blocks of sand - You will need to use this to make glass. Nether Star - Kill the Wither and pick up the star that it drops. The Wither is exceedingly difficult to spawn and kill for lower-level players, so make sure you're prepared. Do not spawn the Wither near your house, as it shoots skulls that blow up nearby structures. Fuel - Wood planks or coal will work fine. You'll need this for your furnace when smelting the glass and iron bars."
