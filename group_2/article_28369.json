      "content": "Let the relationship progress slowly. If you want to slowly and carefully build a healthy relationship, you can start with a low-key date, such as at a coffee shop. If you want something a bit more engaging, try a round of bowling or mini golf. Avoid the movies for a first date, since this typically leaves little time for conversation before or after the movie."

If you show that you can not only solve the issue but also avoid making the same mistake in the future, she will greatly appreciate your presence in her life.

There's nothing more embarrassing for a girl than when her boyfriend tells everyone that she's \"his,\" followed by an offensive term, or that he'll \"get her in bed tonight.\" Don't say these things to or about anyone. It's okay to compliment her beauty, but don't make sexual references when you're talking about her looks, as this is embarrassing for girls. Keep your intimate relationship details private, unless she tells you otherwise. Avoid teasing her in front of peers, and never ignore her."

It's always a little uncomfortable for a girl to hang out with her boyfriend's friends (unless she knows them), so make sure that your friends are treating her right. They shouldn't be flirting with her, calling her names, or commenting on her body. This will make your girlfriend feel very uncomfortable in their presence. Do not let your friends use sexist language about other women, as this will make your girlfriend wonder if they speak that way about her behind her back. If your friends do something to upset your girlfriend, confront them as soon as possible. Pull them aside and say, \"I felt offended by the way you spoke to my girlfriend\" or, if you need to be more direct, \"I know you thought that was funny, but that wasn't cool.\" Be firm, but understanding, and keep the conversation focused on how you feel, rather than take an accusatory tone."
