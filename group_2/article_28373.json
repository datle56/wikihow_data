      "content": "Never stop talking. Psychologists have said that effective communication is one of the key factors in successful relationships. Keep communicating and put effort into talking. This doesn't mean that you can never pause or enjoy a moment of silence, but is instead meant more metaphorically. There may be times when you feel like you have nothing more to say, but if you want to have that spark, there are lots of ways to keep the communication channels flowing beyond \"pass the salt, please.\""

Ask her about her friends, her family and their lives, and have long conversations about how she likes to spend her days. What are her hobbies? What are her likes and dislikes? [3] X Research source Talk about everyday things that interest her, be it shopping, cooking, listening to music, or blogging. Your girlfriend will feel special in that you're willing to stop and listen to her. [4] X Research source Many women find it annoying when men just talk about themselves. [5] X Research source Talking about your girlfriend's interests will help her see that you're genuinely interested in knowing everything about her and her life. It also shows her that you're intent on sticking around for a while. Be genuine. Don't fake an interest in something; this could backfire and end up hurting her feelings. You may find that you share common hobbies, thus bonding you more tightly. And when you do meet her friends or family, you'll already have a bunch of conversation starters with which to impress them!"

Social psychology researchers have found that asking questions to one another almost always make two people feel better about each other and want to see each other again. The top 5 questions to ask are: 1) Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want to go out for dinner with? 2) Would you like to be famous? 3) Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? 4) What would make a perfect day for you? 5) When did you last sing to yourself and/or to someone else? You should each take a turn answering each question and do so in order.

      "content": "Talk about her beliefs. All of us have our own individual views about life but we often keep these to ourselves. By inviting her to open up about the big questions of life, you'll understand more about who she is at her very core and her value system. Ask her about whether she attends church or how she was raised. Ask whether she plans to keep up her family's beliefs and traditions. Getting into the big stuff will show her that you're committed and also that you're able to be serious as well as playful."

Talk about your first crush or the time you did something silly. Then get her to spill all of her stories. Both of you will benefit from learning more about each others' histories. You'll laugh and get a better sense of how the other person came to be who they are today. Talking even about painful, embarrassing or hurtful past memories will also show her that you trust her enough to tell her the less savory stories alongside the funny ones. Hopefully she will show her trust in you by disclosing her past experiences too."

[7] X Research source Be open and tell her about all of the little things you did that day, whether it be at school or work or at home. This keeps you two engaged in each other's day-to-day life, which is, let's be honest, not the most exciting, but is highly important.

[8] X Research source Start making \"we\" statements (e.g. \"We\" should get furniture for your new dorm room. \"We\" should go see that movie you've been wanting to see next weekend, etc.). For example, if you're with someone who loves art, make plans to go to the Getty Museum. If she likes ice hockey, suggest you both go to a game. Start planning holidays and special dates. This is always a fun time in a relationship. Decide when you'll see her family and when you'll spend with yours over big holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. She'll love that you're thinking ahead and showing your that she and her family are a priority for you, especially during busy times like the holidays. By talking about the future, and even just the short-term future, you're helping her imagine herself with you down the line."

This isn't \"giving in\" to her \"demands,\" but instead respecting her wishes. Respect her individuality first and foremost. A woman who feels that her boyfriend allows her to make her own decisions is more likely to remain in a relationship than a woman who feels that she is being told what to do all the time. Don't compare her to other women. Accept and embrace that she is her own unique individual. Don't intimidate or force her into doing things she doesn't want to do. This is a sure-fire way to an unhealthy relationship."
