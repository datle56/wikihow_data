Day: Reduce 11 once to get a sum of 2 (1 + 1 = 2) Year: Add the 4 digits for the first reduction to get 24 (1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 24). Then, reduce 24 one more time to get 6 (2 + 4 = 6). Life Path Number: Add the reduced month (3), day (2), and year (6) to get 11 (3 + 2 + 6 = 11). Then, do one final reduction to get a Life Path Number of 2 (1 + 1 = 2)."
