      "content": "Clean the bed . Wash your sheets and pillowcases once a week, and clean your comforter at least once a season (every 3 months). Bedding can be odorous if you don't wash it regularly. Instead of making your bed immediately after getting up, pull the sheets down so that the mattress can air out for at least 30 minutes. Your body releases moisture when you sleep, which can dampen the bedding, making it a breeding ground for mold and bacteria."

      "content": "Wipe down surfaces with a damp rag. Use a microfiber dust rag to trap dust, or consider using homemade lemon rags for an added fresh scent. Make these dust rags in advance, and use them to dust your bookshelves, window sills, electronics, and other things. [3] X Expert Source Filip Boksa House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 20 August 2019. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) of water, 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil. Soak a few dust rags in the solution. Old t-shirts, underwear and socks can gain a second life as star cleaners! Wring out the rags so they are damp-dry, and then place them in a glass jar, layering them with the rind of 1 lemon cut into a few pieces. Close the jar tightly. To make things smell extra nice, dilute a few drops of your favorite essential oil in water. Dampen a rag with the oil solution and use that to wipe down any dusty surfaces."

Carry any food garbage out of your room immediately and dispose of it in the kitchen garbage or an outdoor dumpster."

      "content": "Use a carpet freshener. Carpets can often be the source of odors. Sprinkle a commercial carpet freshener onto your rug and vacuum up (follow the instructions for the specific product you're using). Alternatively, consider making this homemade solution, which gets your rug or carpet smelling fresh in no time: Mix 1/2 a cup (110 g) of baking soda with 1/2 a cup (100 g) of borax in a plastic bowl, and then add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of your favorite essential oil (wild orange is a natural flea repellent) or 1 teaspoon (about 2 g) of cinnamon or cloves (the latter deters moths). Stir together until the mixture is free of lumps. Sprinkle the solution onto the carpet and let it sit 15-20 minutes, then vacuum it up. If you're worried about staining a light-colored carpet, skip the cinnamon or cloves. You can use cinnamon or clove essential oils instead. If you or someone else is sensitive to smells, use plain baking soda instead. Simply sprinkle it on the carpet, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then vacuum it up. [9] X Research source"
