      "content": "Choose a flat base plate to form the base of the wall. LEGO base plates are the flat pieces often used as flooring in a model. Use a flat base plate to give your first layer of bricks a surface to attach to so they’re sturdy. [1] X Research source You can choose multiple flat base plates to build your foundation or use a large single one. Choose a brown base plate to mimic dirt or a green one to look like grass."

      "content": "Place rectangular bricks on the base plates to start your wall. Form the first layer of your castle wall by attaching rectangular LEGO bricks to your base plates. Place them end to end so they’re touching and form a single layer. [2] X Research source If you want to give your castle a classic look, use gray bricks. Try to use bricks of the same size so your wall looks more uniform."

      "title": "Use an interlocking technique to stack additional bricks.",
      "content": "Use an interlocking technique to stack additional bricks. An interlocking technique means you take 2 bricks touching end to end, and lay 1 brick across them to keep them connected. As you continue stacking your bricks and building your wall, use an interlocking technique to make your wall sturdier. [3] X Research source An interlocking design is a classic brick wall technique, so using it for your castle will make it look more like a real wall."

      "title": "Leave larger gaps at the bottom of the wall to create gates.",
      "content": "Leave larger gaps at the bottom of the wall to create gates. As you’re stacking your bricks and building your castle wall, choose where you want to place a gate. Leave a larger gap between 2 sides of your wall to leave a gate opening. If you have a LEGO gate piece or drawbridge, add it to the opening and build around it. [4] X Research source If you’re making a larger castle, you can make multiple gate openings. The gate opening can be any size you like, but a proper castle must have a gate!"

      "title": "Stagger the bricks to create openings for windows.",
      "content": "Stagger the bricks to create openings for windows. If you want to add some windows to your castle walls, leave an extra space between 2 bricks so there’s a small opening. Then, continue stacking your castle in an interlocking fashion. [5] X Research source You can adjust the size of your windows by leaving a smaller or a larger gap between bricks. If you have square bricks, you can stagger them to create a series of small windows."

      "content": "Add towers above the gates by stacking corner bricks. If you want to add some towers on top of your gates, use 3-studded corner bricks to add a textured design effect. Stack them on top of your gate and place rectangular bricks across them to create a roof. [6] X Research source You can also add smaller bricks on top to give the tower a spire, or a point."

Stack rectangular bricks in a square pattern to build turrets and then place them at the corners of your walls. [8] X Research source To enhance your turrets, try using grooved bricks to improve the texture and even technical parts for your turrets. Make the turrets taller than your walls. If you’re making multiple turrets, build them the same size and height so your castle looks even."

Attach them to the tops of walls or towers to connect 2 of them together and form a bridge that your LEGO people can cross.
