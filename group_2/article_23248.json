      "content": "Look for floppy-eared Nubians . If your goat has floppy ears that hang about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below its muzzle, you can be sure it’s a Nubian. Also known as Anglo-Nubians, this is a common breed of goat across the world. They are typically stubborn, have round muzzles, and their short, fine coats come in a variety of colors and patterns. [1] X Research source Nubians are considered both dairy and meat goats. They don’t produce as much milk as other breeds, but they’re a popular dairy goat due to their milk’s rich fat content. In addition, they usually do better in warmer climates than other dairy goats, such as Swiss breeds. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Distinguish between docile, erect-eared Swiss breeds. Used for dairy production, Swiss breeds have straight faces, ears that point straight up, are generally calm, and almost always have a tall build. A Swiss breed doe, like does of any other dairy breed, should have a plump, well-formed udder. [3] X Research source Common Swiss breeds include: Alpines , which come in a variety of color patterns, are considered the top-producing dairy goat. They’re a tall breed; does stand at least 32.5 inches (83 cm) at the shoulder, and bucks stand at least 37 inches (94 cm). [4] X Research source The Oberhasli has a distinct light to deep red coat with black markings on the belly, legs, and face. [5] X Research source With a tall, rugged frame, Saanens are built like Alpines, but are always white or cream. They’re a top milk-producing breed and, since they’re extremely docile, they’re well-suited to machine milking. [6] X Research source Toggenburgs are usually shorter than other dairy breeds, but are robustly built. They also tend to be more active and alert than other dairy breeds. Their coats range from deep to light brown with various patches of white or cream. [7] X Research source"

They are heavy, meat-producing goats weighing anywhere from 200-350 lbs (90-159 kg). Their short coats can be red-brown, black, or white. Usually, Boers with white coats have red-brown or black heads. [11] X Research source Like Boers, Kikos are well-built and alert. They have broad, straight muzzles, spiraled horns, and medium-length ears that aren’t as erect as a Swiss breed, but don’t hang like a Nubian. They can have short or thick coats and, while often white, they can come in a variety of colors.

Most are black and white but multicolored goats are not uncommon.When startled, they often freeze up and fall to the ground.

Other fiber goats are dual coated, and have dense, downy undercoats that are used to produce cashmere. They tend to be smaller than the meat and dairy goats, weighing in at around 75-150 lbs (34-68 kg) [14] X Research source Angoras are among the most popular fiber breeds and are easy to spot. They’re fairly large, and their long mohair fleece is always white. [15] X Research source Pygoras and Nigoras are Angora cross-breeds also raised for mohair fiber production. Mixing breeds creates new fiber colors and results in smaller, more manageable goats. [16] X Research source Cashmere goats are a group of several dozen breeds with downy undercoats. They come in a variety of colors, but are all cooler climate goats raised to produce the luxury fabric cashmere. [17] X Research source"
