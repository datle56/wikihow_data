Then, send them an email explaining that you’re trying to identify your strengths so you can choose a career or life path based on them. Include a set of questions in the email and ask that they return it within 3 days. Then, review their responses to find out which strengths come up multiple times. If someone hasn’t responded, send a reminder on the day of the deadline. You might write, “I want to understand my strengths so I can use them to be more successful. I really value your opinion, so I hope you’ll answer these questions about me. Please send your response by Friday, August 16. Also, thank you so much for your time and help.”"
