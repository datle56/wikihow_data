      "title": "Tie the pull ties tight against your thigh.",
      "content": "Tie the pull ties tight against your thigh. If the pair of over the knee boots has a pull tie on the back, you should try pulling the string fully through the eyelets, the little metal holes the string is threaded through. If there is enough slack, double knotting the pull tie may keep it from becoming undone as you walk. [1] X Research source Be careful not to tie the pull ties too tightly, or you might hurt yourself by cutting off circulation. Asking a friend to tighten the pull ties and tie them for you may improve the quality of the knot, thanks to the better angle they can get."

      "title": "Wear thick knee- or thigh-high socks under the boots.",
      "content": "Wear thick knee- or thigh-high socks under the boots. While not technically a part of the boots themselves, thick socks can give the boot more to work with. The friction and tightness of the boot against the sock will support the thigh portion of the boots and keep it in place. [2] X Research source If all your thigh-highs are made with thin fabrics, try layering several socks on top of one another to create a similar filling effect."

    {
      "title": "Fold the tops of the boots over.",
      "content": "Fold the tops of the boots over. Sometimes the tightness formed by simply folding the boot once at the top will help keep it from slipping down. This can be damaging to the material, particularly suede, so double check that you are not forming a permanent crease."

      "title": "Go to a cobbler or shoe repair store for a permanent solution.",
      "content": "Go to a cobbler or shoe repair store for a permanent solution. A cobbler can alter the fit of the thigh portion of the boot to align with your measurements. Over the knee boots are often a pricey affair, and this option will only raise the stakes of your investment, but it will almost guarantee a good fit for the boots. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a “boot bra”.",
      "content": "Make a “boot bra”. Cut two pieces of knit elastic to fit around each of your thighs and sew or glue the ends of each one to make both into their own loop, then attach hook-and-loop fastener strips to each loop and the inside of each boot. When you want to wear the boots, just slip on both loops align them with the hook-and-loop fastener! [4] X Research source There are also boot bras available for purchase online."

      "title": "Keep a device in the boots to prevent slouching during storage.",
      "content": "Keep a device in the boots to prevent slouching during storage. The tendency for over the knee boots to fall down your leg can be made worse by improperly storing them. You can avoid this by using [[Store Knee High Boots|inserts], like old magazines, to keep the boots held up vertically in your closet. [5] X Research source Unless you purchase a device made for over the knee boots, you may need to stack several magazines and balance the boots in order to keep them upright."

      "title": "Use fashion tape to affix your boots to your socks.",
      "content": "Use fashion tape to affix your boots to your socks. Fashion tape is a sturdy double-sided tape that you can use to fix your boots to your socks. Over the knee boots are typically made of a heavy, tough material like leather, so it may take a lot of tape to keep them up. [6] X Research source Watch out for hairs on your thigh. When you rip off the tape, it could accidentally take hairs with it and cause a painful ingrown follicle."

      "title": "Use fashion glue to affix the boots to your skin.",
      "content": "Use fashion glue to affix the boots to your skin. Fashion glue is specifically designed to attach to your skin gently, and can be used when your socks don't reach all the way up to your thighs. You can simply apply some to each side of your thigh, slip on the boots and wait for it to dry. To remove the boots, slide your fingers down the top and gently pull the glue from your skin, and then from the boots."

      "title": "Apply hot glue all around the top of a pair of tall socks.",
      "content": "Apply hot glue all around the top of a pair of tall socks. When it dries, the clear adhesive will create friction between the sock and your boots, helping to keep them up. This works a lot like wearing a pair of thick socks, but without the heat-trapping aspect, as the socks you apply glue to can be thin and breathable. [7] X Research source"
