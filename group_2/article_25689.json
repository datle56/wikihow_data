Follow up with \"nei5 hou2 maa3\" to ask the person \"How are you?\" [3] X Research source Respond to \"nei5 hou2 maa3\" with \"ngo5 hou2 hou2,\" which is similar to saying \"I'm fine\" in English. If the other person asks you first, you might add \"nei5 ne1,\" which means \"how about you\" or \"and you.\" [4] X Research source When greeting friends or children, you can also say \"hei1.\" This is a more casual greeting that's usually not suitable if you're greeting a stranger or someone older than you.

Think of how your voice would rise in pitch when you ask a question — the final tone is your high tone. 2 is a rising tone that starts in the low-mid range and ends high.
