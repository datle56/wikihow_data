[1] X Research source If you use more fat, it will just drip off the meat and cause fire flare-ups; less and the burgers will be dry. [2] X Research source If possible, buy the meat the day you’re going to cook it. Ask the butcher to grind the meat twice, once in the coarse plate of the grinder and then through the fine plate."

Press the balls down to make flat burger shapes about ½ inch (1.27cm) thick. Make a small indentation in the center of the burger with your thumb. This prevents the center from swelling, leading to uneven cooking. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose your cooking method.",
      "content": "Choose your cooking method. The homemade burgers can be cooked with a broiler or grill, fried in the skillet or frying pan, or barbecued. They can also be baked. The method used depends on what you have available and what you prefer by way of taste and texture. Whichever method you choose, after taking the patties out of the fridge, spritz them with a little cooking oil or brush them with some melted butter before cooking. Here are the different methods you can use: Broiler/grill: Preheat the broiler (upper level grill) to medium heat. Line a broiler pan with foil, for easier cleanup after cooking. Place the burgers in the broiler pan. Broil them for 6-7 minutes on each side or until thoroughly cooked. [5] X Research source Frying pan or skillet : Add oil or butter to the pan and fry the burgers well. Be sure to use low heat and a long cook to properly cook the burgers the whole way through. Place the burgers on the barbecue grill. Cook as usual for hamburgers on the barbecue. Bake: Place in the oven on 350ºF/180ºC for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness. You may like to flip them over halfway, testing doneness regularly."

[ citation needed ] However, personal ideas may say differently. For medium-rare burgers, keep a six-ounce burger on the grill for 4 minutes per side (with one flip to each side) so the temperature reaches 125 to 130 °F (52 to 54 °C) [6] X Research source For medium burgers, keep a six-ounce burger on the grill for 4 minutes on the one side, then keep the other side on the grill for 5 minutes side (with one flip to each side) so the temperature reaches 140 to 145 °F (60 to 63 °C), but you should check this at the 8th minute to ensure right temperature is reached. [7] X Research source For medium-well burgers, keep a six-ounce burger on the grill for 5 minutes per side (with one flip to each side). [8] X Research source Well done burgers must be kept on the grill for at least 10 minutes and you must watch the temperature reach no more than 160 °F (71 °C). [9] X Research source"
