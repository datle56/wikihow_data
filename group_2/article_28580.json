      "content": "Opt for a classy fabric. Neon colors, animal prints, and other loud designs are not ideal for ballgowns, which are usually meant to be worn at upscale formal events. Instead, stick with colors, prints, and textures that are more subdued. Some colors, prints, and textures you might consider for your ballgown fabric include: [1] X Research source Dark colors, such as blue, black, plum, and green. Pastels, such as pale pink, baby blue, and mint green. Subdued prints, such as florals, brocades, and other subdued graphic details. Textured fabrics, such as lace, dotted Swiss, and tulle."

[2] X Research source Make sure to consider the shoes you will be wearing as well. If you will be wearing heels, then you might want to show them off a bit, and an ankle length dress will work best for this."

Check your pattern’s package to determine how much fabric you will need to buy. Depending on the style of your ballgown, you may need more or less fabric. The required amount of fabric should be indicated on the back of the pattern’s package. When you are working on a sewing project, it is always better to buy more fabric than you think you will need. Consider rounding up the patterns suggested fabric amounts to the nearest whole amount. For example, if the pattern recommends 2 ¾ yards of a specific type of fabric, then you might want to round up to 3 yards. Consider your pattern’s recommendations for fabric type when you are selecting a fabric. For example, if the pattern recommends using a lightweight fabric, such as satin or crepe, then stick to these types. Subbing for a heavier fabric may affect the way the dress hangs and moves."
