You can also paint a thick coat of liquid anti-fracture membrane on the concrete with a roller brush. The anti-fracture membrane keeps an insulated layer between the concrete and the tile so that it can move with the change of seasons and temperature without cracking the tiles. [2] X Research source"

If the distance between the two is exactly 5', the lines are perpendicular (since a 3-4-5 triangle is a right triangle). If not, adjust the center lines."
