      "title": "Avoid using personal examples.",
      "content": "Avoid using personal examples. As the valedictorian you are representing your entire class in the speech, not just your own experience. Avoid speaking in the first person as much as possible and try to share stories that are relevant to the entire graduating class. For example, you should say “We will always remember when Mr. C. made a perfect dunk on the basketball court” instead of “I will always remember when Mr. C. made a perfect dunk of the basketball court.”"

      "title": "Concentrate on speaking slowly and clearly.",
      "content": "Concentrate on speaking slowly and clearly. On the day of your graduation you will likely be nervous and talk faster than in rehearsal.

Just repeat what you said and keep going."
