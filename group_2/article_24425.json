      "content": "An “Irish goodbye” is when you leave a party without saying goodbye. It essentially means slipping out of a social gathering unnoticed, without letting anyone know that you’re heading home. The term often refers to someone leaving a party because they’ve had a bit too much to drink, and they don’t want to reveal how intoxicated they are, although this isn't always the case.

Or, maybe you’ve been coming down with a cold, and you’re starting to feel a fever coming on. If you’re feeling sick but you don’t want to make a scene, an Irish exit may be the right way to go."

If you need to make your exit and you don’t have time to wait until the host’s conversation ends, you may be better off doing an Irish goodbye. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "You’re having a family emergency or personal issue. Sometimes, unexpected circumstances demand that you leave a party immediately. For example, if your babysitter calls and tells you they have to leave unexpectedly, you'll likely need to leave right away to make it home to your kids. In situations like these, an Irish exit may be necessary because you won’t have time to find the host and say goodbye."

      "content": "An Irish goodbye is sometimes acceptable at large parties or gatherings. If possible, it’s always best to find the host and quickly say goodbye, even at large parties. However, if the host is busy or wrapped up in something, it’s usually acceptable to slip out without saying goodbye. Since there are several other guests and partygoers around, your absence won’t cause a big issue. [3] X Research source You may want to let one other guest know that you’re heading out, so that they can pass along the information to the host."

      "content": "Avoid doing Irish goodbyes at small gatherings or dinner parties. If you’re at an intimate gathering with only a few guests, it’s less acceptable to do an Irish goodbye. [4] X Research source Your absence will be much more noticeable in this situation, and people will likely wonder where you’ve disappeared to. In short, the smaller the gathering is, the more important it is to give a proper goodbye and let people know you’re leaving."

Here are some examples of what to say : “I had to head out, but I didn’t want to interrupt you in the middle of your conversation. Thank you for throwing such a great party—I had an awesome time!” “Just wanted to say thank you so much for having me! I wasn’t feeling too well so I had to head home, but I had a great time.

If the party you left was a celebration for a special occasion, such as a birthday or anniversary, consider sending your host a handwritten thank you note . [6] X Research source They’ll be sure to appreciate such a thoughtful, personal gesture. Here are some tips for sending the perfect thank you note: “First, you want to start off with nice stationery,” says etiquette coach Tami Claytor. She recommends thinking of a thank you card as a little present, meaning it should be aesthetically pleasing and exciting to open up. Next, Claytor recommends being very specific about what you’re thanking them for. For example, thank your host for all the effort they put into the party, and compliment something you really enjoyed about it (the food, the decor, etc). Finally, send your thank you note in a timely manner. Claytor recommends mailing it within 24-48 hours of the party."

If you think your host may be a little upset that you left the gathering without saying goodbye, consider sending a small gift along with your thank you note. A nice candle, floral arrangement, gift card, or your host’s favorite candy can go a long way to smooth over any unintended tensions!"

      "title": "The term “Irish goodbye” may come from stereotypes of Irish-Americans.",
      "content": "The term “Irish goodbye” may come from stereotypes of Irish-Americans. The exact origins of the term are unclear, but some believe that it comes from the stereotype that Irish Americans are more likely to have several drinks at parties, potentially leaving them too intoxicated to say goodbye at the end of the night. Others believe that the term dates all the way back to the Potato Famine, when Irish people emigrated from Ireland to other countries in large numbers. [7] X Research source Although the term “Irish goodbye” may have some origins in stereotypes, it usually isn’t considered rude or offensive in modern conversation. [8] X Research source According to Rice University’s database of neologisms, the term “Irish goodbye” may have originated in Boston, Massachusetts, a city with a very large Irish-American population. [9] X Research source Throughout history, the act of leaving without saying goodbye has been given different names. For example, the term “French leave” has been used in England since the 18th century. In response, the French came up with their own phrase, “filer à l’anglaise,” or “to leave the English way.” [10] X Research source"
