      "content": "Drill two holes in a washer. Using a 5/32 inch drill bit, drill two holes in a flat washer. Lay the washer flat and drill one hole at the top and the other hole at the bottom of the washer. For example, the two holes should be located at 12 and 6 o’clock. [3] X Research source Position the holes between the pre-existing center hole of the washer and the outer rim."

      "content": "Thread the aircraft cable through a nut. Take one end of the cable and thread it through a ¼ inch nut. Then, thread it back through the nut creating a loop. Continue to pull the cable back through the nut until you have a loop with a ¾ inch (2 cm) diameter. [5] X Research source Leave an extra inch of cable at the end."

Pull the cable about a foot through the washer. Then, loop the cable through the bottom hole of the washer from the inside of the bend to the outside. [6] X Research source This should create a loop."

      "content": "Set the snare trap. In order to set a snare trap, you want to place it on a trail or path that is frequented by coyotes. Then, attach the small looped end of the snare to a solid object, such as a fence post or small sapling. This will anchor the snare in place. Hang the larger loop from a nearby branch so that the bottom of the loop is approximately 12 inches (30 cm) off the ground. [9] X Research source When a coyote walks past it will mistake the hanging wire for a branch and walk into the snare. The loop will tighten, trapping the coyote as it continues walking and the bent washer will prevent the loop from loosening."

      "content": "Create a trap bed. When setting a trap, you need to dig a trap bed. The trap bed should be large enough so that it can fit the trap when opened and laying flat. It should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep so that it can be covered with dirt and hidden."

      "content": "Cover the trap with dirt. Set the trap and then place dirt over top of the trap. Pour the dirt through a sifter so that it gently sprinkles over the trap. Try and make the area look as natural as possible. You can also lay larger sticks or mounds of grass and dirt along the sides of the trap. These can be used as guides to make sure the coyote steps on the trap. [10] X Research source When placing guides, be sure to make it look as natural as possible. Do not put the sticks in a straight line. They need to look like they fell there naturally."

      "content": "Dig a tunnel near the trap bed. Once the trap is covered by dirt, dig a hole about 8-10 inches away from the trap bed. The opening of the hole should be facing towards the trap bed and the hole should be two inches in diameter and dug on a 45 degree angle. The hole is supposed to look like it was dug by a small rodent, such as a mouse or mole and the small dirt pile that is covering the trap will look like the dirt that was removed from digging the hole."

      "content": "Position the trap on a natural coyote trail. The best traps are located in areas where coyotes naturally walk on a regular basis. Typically, these paths are located along fences or other field boundaries. Before setting your trap look for coyote tracks or traces of hair. This will help you determine where the coyotes travel.

Coyotes will also be attracted to dog food, which can act as a cheap substitute to raw meat. [12] X Research source This meat could also attract domestic animals, such as dogs. As a result, you should place the trap far away from homes. You can also purchase lures and scents from a hunting store."

As a result, you should always wear gloves when setting traps so that your scent is not left near the trap. You can also spray the area surrounding the trap with commercial coyote lures to cover up the smell. [13] X Research source"

Read the local laws in your jurisdiction concerning coyote trapping. In some states coyotes that are trapped must be euthanized. Other locations may have specific handling legislation. Always wear gloves when removing a coyote from the trap. This will help prevent the transmission of diseases, such as rabies. [14] X Research source If the animal is still alive, you may want to contact a wildlife control expert."
