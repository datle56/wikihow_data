If you're planning to dress up as the classic version of Robin, leave the red shirt untucked."

To be classic Robin, you should wear a short length completely yellow cape. To be modern Robin, you should wear a long length black cape or a black cape with a yellow underside. [4] X Research source Get a rectangle of fabric that is about a foot wider than your body and long enough to drape on your shoulders and extend down to your calves. If you want a black and yellow cape, sew together the black and yellow fabric on all four sides. Cut the fabric into a cape shape. You can use a cape template or freehand cut the cape. Fold the fabric rectangle in half. Cut one end of the rectangle so that the folded side has a semi circle cut out about 1 ½ inches from the top and the non folded side has a rounded corner. The semi circle should be wide enough for your neck. Cut the folded side above the semi circle apart to create the neck hole. Glue or sew a ribbon onto either side of the neck hole to use for tying the cape. Classic Robin's cape has an oxford collar while the modern version has a kung-fu collar. You can also make a collar for the cape separately from the cape."

Wrap the center of the broom stick with a thin strip of fabric or thin rope to create a grip in the middle of the staff. Classic Robin should skip this step, since he doesn't carry this weapon."
