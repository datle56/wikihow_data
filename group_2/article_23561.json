Since Jupiter is the planet of learning, save your studying or educational projects for Thursdays for maximum good luck."

      "title": "A planet that’s too strong is just as bad as one that’s too weak.",
      "content": "A planet that’s too strong is just as bad as one that’s too weak. Jupiter is naturally very strong in most people’s horoscopes, so only perform strengthening acts now and then to keep up the relationship. Take a break from Jupiter-related activities (especially on Thursdays) to downplay its effects if you feel the giant planet’s influence in your life is too strong. An overbalanced Jupiter can cause spiritual unrest and health problems like inflammation, dry skin, or indigestion. If Jupiter is overwhelming and causing bad side effects, try strengthening its enemy planet, Mercury, to fix the balance in your horoscope."
