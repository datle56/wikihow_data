To melt it, follow the instructions on the package and either warm it up on the stovetop or in a wax warmer. It should be warm, but not so hot that it burns your skin. [2] X Research source To test the wax, apply a little bit to the inside of your wrist. If it burns or hurts, let the wax cool before applying it."

Typically, you can pour the product into a pot and then warm it up on medium heat for about 5 minutes. Test the wax on the inside of your wrist to make sure it’s warm (about body temperature), not hot. [10] X Research source If your sugar wax is a roll-on, there’s no need to heat it up. Instead, you can simply apply it directly to your body. You can also make your own sugar wax out of sugar, water, and lemon juice."

Stand with one leg up on the toilet for better reach, and slowly swipe the wax onto your skin in an upward motion (against the direction of hair growth). Press the wax into your skin 2 to 3 times, spreading it into a thin layer. [12] X Research source Work in an area that’s about 4 in (10 cm) long and 2 in (5.1 cm) wide. The key to sugar waxing is to press the sugar into your pores. This will help reduce the risk of ingrown hairs, and many people say that it helps with pain management as well."

Use your free hand to hold your skin taut, then quickly rip the wax in a downward motion (in the direction of hair growth). Keep going until you’ve removed the entire piece of wax from your skin. [13] X Research source You may have to pull your wax strip 2 or 3 times before it comes off completely. Go quickly to make it hurt less! Sugaring is also exfoliating, so you may notice some dead skin cells coming off as well. If your skin is stinging, gently press down on it with your free hand to apply mild pressure. This can help relieve some of the pain."

Work your way over your bikini area, your vulva, and your rectum to remove all the hair, using a mirror to see what you’re doing.
