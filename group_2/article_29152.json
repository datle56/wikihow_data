He may start to miss you , and if he knows what he did wrong, he may start to feel sorry that he ever did so. On the other hand, if the guy asks you what is wrong or what he did, use this opportunity to tell him . He may not realize that he did something wrong, and he may genuinely feel sorry when he finds out."

      "content": "Make him feel your detachment when you have to interact. Sometimes, it is not possible to avoid the guy, especially if you work together, are taking classes together, or are living together. What you can do, however, is make him miss the person you used to be, as well as the warmth, love, and cheerfulness you reserved for him. When he talks to you, stay neutral and give him polite but short answers. Don’t respond the way you used to; instead, act like you would with an acquaintance. This may make him sorry that you two aren’t talking the way you used to."

If you share the same group of friends and often hang out together (such as at the lunch table at school), then talk only to your other friends. Keep in mind, however, that this might also alert your other friends that something is wrong, and they may or may not support you."

      "content": "Consider dating other people. If you have broke up with the guy, consider going out on dates with other people. This does not mean that you have to enter another relationship, especially if you are not ready for one. If the guy sees you enjoying yourself with other men, he might start to feel jealous. If he knows what he did wrong, he might start to regret it. [1] X Research source Do not date other people if you are still in a relationship or if you are not ready to date other people. If you are not ready to date other people, try flirting with other guys instead, especially where your ex can see."

      "content": "Consider getting rid of some of the items he gave to you. If he gave you some flowers the week before the offense, consider giving them away or tossing them out. If you have a picture he gave you that you usually keep in your locker, get rid of that picture—especially if there is a chance that he might see it. This might send the guy the message that he hurt you, and he might start to feel guilty for what he did. Getting rid of the things your guy gave you might also help you feel better, especially if this is after a breakup . [2] X Research source"

He might even realize that he messed up somewhere. He may not apologize, but he may at least try to make things up to you."

Go to a concert , a club, or a theme park. Let him see you having fun and enjoying yourself without him. If he sees how happy you can be without him, he may feel sorry for doing what he did to lose you. Don't sulk when you are not around him. He might take that as a sign that you are missing him. Instead, act cheerful. Laugh, smile , and be social. If you are in a relationship with the guy, do this with caution. He might suspect that you are cheating on him, which can make things worse. If you recently broke up with the guy, going out and doing something that you enjoy might help you feel better ."

If you never dressed up in the past, consider doing so when you go out by yourself. Only do this if you feel comfortable doing so."

      "content": "Do not take revenge lightly. Seeking revenge and finding ways to make him suffer might be tempting, especially if his offense was serious (such as cheating). Unfortunately, revenge usually ends poorly for both parties. Sometimes, revenge can go too far and land you in trouble. Instead of physical revenge, try emotional revenge, such as spending time with other people (especially males), or having fun without him. Ignore him, and keep your attitude cold and reserved when you must speak with him."

For example, if you or the guy are in a bad mood, the conversation is less likely to go smoothly.

Some guys may also find it more difficult to apologize when they are being accused of too many things at once.

If he feels overly-accused by you, he might be more likely to feel defensive. This does not mean that you should accept or forgive his offenses; some things, such as cheating , are always wrong. At the same time, it might be worth listening to him. He might be feeling just as hurt as you are. If the guy mentions that you hurt him too, try not to take offense, or your conversation might turn into an argument instead with both parties feeling angry instead of sorry. Some guys might be hesitant to apologize if they feel like they have to take sole responsibility for the offense. Even if it really is all his fault, try hard not to make it seem that way.

Instead, just explain to the guy that what he did hurt you. Most guys do not like to see those that they care for hurt. He may apologize in his own way.
