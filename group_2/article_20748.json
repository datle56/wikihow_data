How he performs in competition will show how he approaches the world, whether he is aggressive and a leader, or whether he is more laid back. Watch how he treats others. Someone may ask a stupid question and he may laugh, showing him to be something of a cad. Or, someone might need help and he will lend a hand.

What's your favorite film/video game/book? If you could travel anywhere in the world right now, where would you go and why? What sports do you like? What was your proudest moment? What do you look for in a girl? What is the most insane thing you have ever done? What do you like eating? Remember, this isn't an audition.
