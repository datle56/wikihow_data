      "content": "To lose weight, eat 0.73 to 1 gram of protein daily per pound of body weight. If you're an athlete or perform intense exercise daily, increase that to 1 to 1.5 grams of protein per pound. [1] X Research source You can determine the right amount of protein (in grams) for you by multiplying your weight in pounds by 0.36. Factors like age, sex, and health conditions play a part in necessary protein levels. Older adults often require more protein, while women need less than men. A high-protein diet isn’t suitable for those with chronic kidney or heart disease, who require a much lower amount of protein. [2] X Research source No matter your activity level or weight loss goals, it’s a good idea to visit a registered dietician who can assist you in finding the right protein amount to fit your body’s needs and encourage healthy weight loss.

      "content": "Drinks Drink your protein for an added boost. When you need a quick meal replacement or a satisfying snack, enjoy a smoothie using a few of your favorite high-protein ingredients. [9] X Research source Smoothies and shakes shouldn’t be your only source of protein, though, especially because too much can lead to bloating, nausea, or other digestion issues. [10] X Research source Even if you use protein powder as a base for your smoothie, other great add-ons include Greek yogurt, chia or flax seeds, nut butter, low-fat or non-dairy milk, nuts, and even tofu. Most protein powders contain between 20 and 30 grams in each serving. Greek yogurt has 13 grams of protein per half cup, while peanut butter has 8 grams per 2 tablespoons and cashews have 6 grams per quarter cup. It’s even quite possible to make a protein shake without protein powder. Smoothie idea: Whip up a delicious peanut butter banana shake using Greek yogurt, cashews, and protein powder. The protein in this powerhouse of a smoothie can add up to nearly 50 grams in a single smoothie! [11] X Research source"
