But I send you a cream-white rosebud With a flush on its petal tips; For the love that is purest and sweetest Has a kiss of desire on the lips."

      "content": "“Sonnets from the Portuguese 43” – Elizabeth Barrett Browning How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day’s Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right; I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death."

But love is like the shower That waters gardens dry, And brings to earth a flower That blooms, but cannot die."

The sea lies violet, deep, and wide, My heart beats high with the rushing tide; Was it fancy, beloved, the seagulls cried: “Sing loud for love, for I love him so”? Oh, little boat for tossing wave, Sing loud for love, for I love him so! Oh, y’all pine tree in the shadows grave, Sing loud for love, for I love him so! The little waves kiss the gleaming sand, I laugh in the sun on the joyful land; Beloved, one clasp of your strong young hand; The world is fair, for I love you so!"

Which owes the other most? my love was long, And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong; I loved and guessed at you, you construed me And loved me for what might or might not be – Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong. For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’ With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done, For one is both and both are one in love: Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’ Both have the strength and both the length thereof, Both of us, of the love which makes us one."

If ever wife was happy in a man, Compare with me, ye women, if you can. I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold, Or all the riches that the East doth hold. My love is such that rivers cannot quench, Nor ought but love from thee give recompense. Thy love is such I can no way repay; The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray. Then while we live, in love let’s so persevere, That when we live no more, we may live ever."

Now it may be Calm like the brow of some sweet child asleep; Again its seething billows surge and leap And break in fulness of their ecstasy. Each wave so like the wave which came before, Yet never two the same! Imperative And then persuasive as the cooing dove, Encroaching ever on the yielding shore— Ready to take; yet readier still to give— How like the myriad-minded sea, is love."

But only still, benumbed indifference Unwaked at thy soft whisper of my name. Come now, I tire of waiting to know love; Teach me to scorn indifference white and dim For I would drain fate’s cup of joy or strife; Would play to the lost chord the vibrant hymn That passion sings; my heart lifted above Dull apathy; pulsating; knowing Life."

Her violet eyes were sweet with mystery. You looked in mine, the music rose and fell Like little, lisping laughter of the sea; Our souls were barks, wind-wafted from the shore— Gold cup, a rose, a ruby, who can tell? Soft—music ceases—I recall no more."
