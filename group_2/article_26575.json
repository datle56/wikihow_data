      "content": "Embrace your Libra's social side and join them when they go out. Libras tend to be social butterflies. They’re often very popular and they revel in social situations. Accompany them to parties and events whenever you’re invited, and try not to get frustrated if their calendar fills up quickly. If you can't keep up with their rigorous social schedule, that's okay. Remember, Libras tend to be fair if you’re honest and present all of the facts. [6] X Research source Don't freak out if your Libra is a little flirty with other people. Libras often try to treat everyone fairly, so you may feel like the apple of their eye until you notice they’re giving someone else their attention. This is just a part of their personality, so if you can't be secure about your relationship, you may want to pursue someone else."

      "content": "Be fair and consider all perspectives before handing down judgement. It is said that Libras are extremely concerned with fairness and justice, and there's no bigger turnoff to a Libra than someone who jumps to conclusions and rushes to judgement. Before making a decision, take a moment to consider all the different sides of the issue at hand. Your Libra will likely appreciate that you are trying to be fair and balanced in your judgement. [7] X Research source If you selfishly try to get more than your fair share of something, or you dismiss someone without giving them a chance to present their case, a Libra may quickly lose interest in you as a potential mate."

      "content": "Give a Libra plenty of time to make big decisions. Libras supposedly like to see things from every angle, so let them take their time while they’re working through a question. Try not to get frustrated if they take a long time when they’re trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, which movie they want to see, or which pair of shoes is right for them. This applies to relationship decisions too, so don’t get down if a Libra doesn’t commit right away. Once you’re in, you’re in it for the long haul! [10] X Research source Don't poke fun at your Libra for being indecisive. They often need patience and understanding while they make up their minds. [11] X Research source If you pressure a Libra to make a decision and they end up feeling like it was a bad choice, they may blame and resent you for rushing them. When it comes to smaller decisions, like where to get dinner, it's okay to take charge if they’re having trouble deciding. They may even feel relieved you took that issue off of their plate.

      "content": "Cuddle, give gifts, and share your feelings to increase the romance. Libras are usually very romantic and your partner will probably respond well to romantic gestures. You could give them flowers, chocolates, or take them out to a nice candle-lit dinner. The bigger the gesture, the more likely they are to fall deeply in love with you. [13] X Research source Put love notes in their coat pocket or inside a book they’re reading to surprise them later.

Try booking a room at a fancy hotel, taking them to a nice restaurant, or traveling to an exotic location to share a picnic under the stars. Make sure gifts and experiences are elegant and refined. Libras love comfort and extravagance, so taking them somewhere nice will help you build your relationship with one another.

      "title": "Encourage your Libra to be open and honest, even if you may get hurt.",
      "content": "Encourage your Libra to be open and honest, even if you may get hurt. Honest communication can be difficult for some Libras. When trying to keep things harmonious, they can bury or ignore messy feelings. If they’re angry or full of doubt about the relationship, they won’t jump up to volunteer their feelings. Unfortunately, it’s usually more damaging for people to repress their feelings than share them, so you’re better off encouraging them to express themselves. [17] X Research source Tell your Libra you value their opinion, and emphasize that the best thing they can do is be honest with you, even if you think the truth will hurt. Libras may seem detached from emotional situations. As an air sign, they tend to watch things from above, and try to remove themselves from messy entanglements. This doesn't mean they don’t have feelings, just that they’re trying to be impartial and fair by taking a step back."

      "content": "Get ready for a passionate, lasting connection if you are a Gemini. You will likely both love travel, shopping, socializing, and adventure. You and your Libra may eventually get so in sync with one another that you make other people jealous! Though you can both be very flirtatious, the romance and spontaneity in your relationship will keep the both of you invested in the relationship. Share ideas, debate, and be careful not to wear each other out! [18] X Research source Keep in mind both Geminis and Libras can be indecisive. If your partner isn't stepping up with the decision making, you'll have to make the calls to keep things from going stagnant. Pay attention to your finances. Since both of you will likely love luxury and spending money on the finer things, you may be in danger of over-spending. Indulge each other, but take care that you are being responsible with your money."

Choose date activities that will stimulate conversation and allow you and your Libra to really dig into issues. Check out thought-provoking films, outsider art, or read the same book and get into a deep discussion. [19] X Research source Try to keep your rebellious streak in check. You may not care much what other people think, but this is very important to Libras. Don't mock them for caring about manners or their desire to be popular. A Libra will likely require more romance than you’re normally into. Try to hold their hand and cuddle a little more often than you normally might in another relationship."

      "content": "Watch out for conflicts and try to be patient if you’re a Cancer. While you're both seeking a connection, Libras are often looking for mental compatibility and can appear detached to someone seeking a primarily emotional connection. Cancers can be moody, while many Libras try to avoid rocking the boat. You will have to work hard to understand one another’s points of view to make this difficult match work. [20] X Research source Being very social and flirtatious is part of dating some Libras. Try not to get angry or see it as a sign of disloyalty if your Libra wants to go out and spends lots of time with friends. They’re deeply loyal, even if it doesn’t seem like it all the time. Cancers tend to get overly emotional, while Libras tend to withhold emotions. Work on being open with one another and you’ll be able to work it out no problem."

Capricorns are often very serious and career-minded, while many Libras are social butterflies and think more about relationships than work. Libras usually appreciate compliments, while Capricorns tend to struggle giving praise. As a Capricorn, try to open yourself up more often and say “yes” to things when you’d normally say “no.” In many ways, you’re likely to be compatible, but the friction in personalities can lead to conflict if you aren’t careful. [21] X Research source Try letting your Libra's friendliness and sociability work for your career. They’ll be a great date for work functions. Your boss, coworkers, and clients will all love your charismatic partner. A traditional role of breadwinner and homemaker can work for you two, but it may also cause things to become stagnant and dull. Make sure you're breaking up work with vacations and avoid spending every weekend away from your partner. [22] X Research source"

Libras tend to be very calculated and social, while you’re likely very impulsive and social. The key thing here is that you’re both interested in adventure. Get ready for some late-night chats, fun parties, and a fulfilling social life. Just don’t forget to take the trash out before garbage day and remember to set your alarm clocks—you’ll both be in danger of glossing over the boring, essential stuff. [24] X Research source You’re unlikely to encounter any conflict with one another, but you may come into disagreement over practical things. When you should go file your taxes, start apartment hunting, or mail a check may become points of friction if you aren’t organized."

This can lead to some ridiculous misunderstandings early on and it may take the two of you time to figure out how to communicate. Once you do get your footing, enjoy your time together! Scorpios and Libras tend to have very intense, loving relationships once they sort through the initial phase of the relationship. [25] X Research source Try not to overthink things.

This can lead to some clashes if the two of you aren’t willing to compromise and see the see the other person’s perspective. The good news is that if you can solve these problems early and build your relationship on mutual respect and compromise, you and your Libra can make a phenomenal pair. [26] X Research source Your love of being number one is a respectable sign of your drive, but a Libra may interpret this as self-absorption or narcissism. Try to keep any boastful bragging to yourself—especially at the beginning of the relationship. If you can establish understanding early on in your relationship, a Libra is a great partner for you. Their balanced nature will really help you out if you tend to lose your patience or temper."

They’ll open your mind to the finer things in life and help you see the beauty in ugly situations. At the same time, your grit and impulsiveness will help shake Libra into action and keep their head out of the clouds. This is a great pair, but be careful with that joyful grit of yours. Too much cursing, shouting, or late-night partying may turn your partner off if you overdo it. [27] X Research source One of the best upsides of this pairing is that your main issue is fairly easy to solve. You probably just need to throw a nice shirt or dress on more often than you normally would, while your Libra just needs to put up with a cheap dinner every once in a while."

Just remember that you aren’t competing with your partner! If you can compartmentalize your feelings, you’re sure to find a supporting and loving partner in a Libra. [28] X Research source Leos tend to say “yes” to everything, while Libras often say “let me think about it.” This is a good thing when it comes to minor decisions, but it can cause friction if you’re discussing an important decision."

Since Libras aren’t known for being open books that say what they’re feeling, this match can lead to some difficult interactions. While your first impulse may be to try and please your partner, try to do things that you find fulfilling and interesting. Don’t focus on over-analyzing the relationship and gamble a little bit when it comes to sharing your feelings. This pairing can work, but you may need to step outside of your comfort zone more often.
