      "content": "Eat a proper, largely vegan diet. [1] X Research source Before moving onto the more obvious steps like cosmetics and fashion, it's important to have a strong foundation in health; to look like someone, you have to act like her! Megan has stated that she adheres to a strictly raw, vegan diet. This means eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, and staying mostly away from meat and animal by-products, like eggs and dairy. Megan will still eat some meat and non-vegan ingredients, but she eats them in strict moderation. Her health-conscious eating habits are a large part of why she's able to maintain such a good figure. Most raw food diets include fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, sprouts, root vegetables and squashes, fresh herbs and spices. Try working these foods into your diet as much as possible. If you're used to a meat-heavy diet, you may have to eat larger dishes than you're used to, but you should notice a major difference in the way you're feeling within a week. Megan stays away from processed foods, like potato chips and white bread. These 'empty snack' foods are notoriously low on proper nutrition, so it's recommended to replace these common snacks with healthier substitutes like almonds. Not only will this make you more like Megan, you'll most likely find you have far more energy than you used to!"

For breakfast, Megan eats eggs. Usually she eats two egg whites with avocado. [2] X Research source She also may have a smoothie for breakfast. If you follow this routine, make sure your smoothie has a variety of high-nutrient vegetables. As eggs are animal by-products, it is recommended you keep them as a secondary part of your breakfasts; this will keep your cholesterol low, and have you feeling your best for the day! For lunch and dinner, Megan is big on salads, with a minor helping of meat, like grilled chicken. Her bigger meals revolve around sources of protein, fibre and healthy fat.

      "content": "Adhere to a strict exercise routine. In order to look like Megan, you'll need to follow a pretty intense exercise schedule. She does one circuit 3 times a week for 60 minutes a day. She also has days where she works out for 2 hours. [5] X Research source While Megan enjoys the help of an exercise trainer, you won't need professional help to approximate her regimen. Making stretching, and cardio-intensive exercises like running and dancing a regular part of your routine is an necessary step towards getting a toned, athletic physique.

Megan does interval training, and this particular method has been shown to be most effective with weight loss and maintenance. Try alternating between a minute of intense exercise and a minute of rest. This will jumpstart your metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories throughout your day. Applying this to your subsequent exercise routines will make a significant difference in the visible results."

      "title": "Follow a consistent skincare routine.",
      "content": "Follow a consistent skincare routine. One of the most glamorous things about Megan Fox is the pristine glow of her skin and hair. While some of this can be attributed to Hollywood makeup magic, there's no denying that Megan adheres to a very savvy health routine. Getting a healthy shimmer to your skin requires patience and devotion to a regular cleansing routine. While getting better-looking skin will undoubtedly have you looking more like Megan Fox, regular care routines should be based around the characteristics and issues of your own skin. Washing your face regularly is a must for most beauty programs, especially if you are prone to oily skin. Use a good chapstick or lip balm to avoid dry lips. Use a face wash that matches your skin type. If you have dry skin, try using a moisturizing face wash. On the other hand, i your skin is oily, you might want to try an astringent cleanser. Exfoliating your skin on a regular basis will ensure your skin is silky smooth. A build-up of dead skin flakes is one of the most common reasons why your skin may not be as radiant as it should be."

      "title": "Use the right foundation.",
      "content": "Use the right foundation. Get the base of your face ready by using the correct foundation. Use a foundation brush to apply it to your skin. Make sure to match the color to your skin tone so your makeup looks fresh and natural. While Megan Fox has preferred foundations that work for her, it's likely that other pigments will work for your own skin tone. It is important to note that following Megan's cosmetic routines closely may result in a less successful look if your skin is any different from hers. The best thing is to use her style as an aesthetic inspiration whilst trying to formulate your own. Megan's makeup artist has used Cle de Peau Silk Cream Foundation on her face. She uses NARS Radian Creamy Concealer in Custard for her under eye circles. Megan has also stated she likes Giorgio Armani's Luminous Silk Foundation."

      "content": "Emphasize your eyes and eyelashes. One of Megan's most famous features is her long, luscious eyelashes. Because she naturally boasts such strong lashes, she doesn't need to use a lot of eye makeup. If you also have big eyelashes, applying some shimmer and a thin line of liner along your top eyelid will get you close to Megan's look. On the other hand, if you lashes don't stand out naturally, it may be worth it to try out an eyelash curler or false lashes. Megan has said she uses Giorgio Armani's Eyes to Kill mascara. If you want to look as close to Megan as possible, it may be worth it to pick up some blue coloured contact lenses from your local pharmacy, if your eyes aren't naturally that hue. You can personalize a false eyelash by placing it onto your lash line and measuring the width of the false eyelash to the width of your lash line. Then carefully cut off any excess lash that extends outside the width of your lash line. You can get another pair of lashes and fuse them with a little lash glue before applying them. It gives them some extra dimension."

      "content": "Apply a bold red lipstick. Megan tends to use a classy red lipstick. Although the particular shade of red varies based on her outfit, using a bolder shade of red than you normally would is a great place to start. Adding some lip liner around your lips will give you a fuller-looking pout. Again, Megan's choice of lipsticks may suit her perfectly, but it is recommended you make an effort to find shades that work best for your own body and skin tone. Megan uses Giorgio Armani Rouge d’Armani Lipstick in 400 contrasts often. Makeup artists have also used Stila Lip Liner #25 on her, paired with Hourglass Femme Rouge Velvet Crème Lipstick in Icon. Also try M.A.C. Lipstick in Morange for an orange-red, Dior Addict Lipcolor in Decadent Plum for a darker red, and Lancôme L'Absolut Rouge Lipcolor in Absolute Rouge for a bright red."

      "content": "Keep your hairstyle simple, but stylish. Megan Fox retains an approachable aura. This is because she prefers to do without overly elaborate hairstyles. Mostly, she goes for loose beach waves, straight styles, or ponytails. You may want to see which of these hairstyles overlap with styles that have personally worked for you. The important thing is to keep your hair unfrilled and personable. As you'll be sporting a lot of glamour in other parts of your style, having a casual hairdo will go a long way towards making yourself look friendly and relatable. If you're going for a straight style, use a dab of shine serum on damp strands. Following that, dry your hair and use a straightener. If you decide to go curly, apply styling spray, like a sea salt spray, and use a medium-sized iron to curl varying widths of hair. Undo slightly with your fingers. Megan doesn't have bangs, so make sure your hair is long in the front. She also has layers in her hair. Megan has long brown hair, so you may want to dye or grow your hair to make it more similar to hers."

Try using Chanel Precision Brow Definer in Soft Brown and L'Oréal Paris Brow Stylist Custom Brow Shaping Pencil to help you get Megan's nicely-defined brows.

      "content": "Be a little outspoken. If you've read any interviews with Megan Fox, you'll know she speaks her mind. Where many more conventional celebrities are prone to censoring themselves, Megan's blunt, no-filter attitude is part of what makes her so alluring. She's garnered a reputation as being someone who says what she's really thinking, even if it might land her into trouble. Try making a habit of saying what's one your mind in social situations, even if it runs the risk of sounding abrupt. The sort of honesty it takes to speak your mind regularly may feel awkward at first, but greater confidence comes with experience and exposure. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Show your eccentric side.",
      "content": "Show your eccentric side. As well as being outspoken, Megan Fox's personality and behaviour is notably stranger than most of her glamourous contemporaries. Coming across as eccentric ties into honesty; all of us have a strange side to our personality, but most of us have learned to bury that part of ourselves in regular company. Learning to bring that side back out again may take some time, but the striking uniqueness you'll gain from such a development will be will worth the effort. Part of Megan Fox's star-material aura results from her innate oddball character, so don't be afraid to meld some idiosyncrasies in with your own glamorous persona!"

      "content": "Learn to pose seductively. While certain aspects of personality, like eccentricity, are largely inherent, facets of stardom like learning how to pose can be learned. While the cameras are on her, Megan keeps her smiles mild and seductive. She positions herself to look over the shoulder when photos are being taken of her; this way, her curves are more visible in the photo. Megan also poses with one hand on her hip, with her hip cocked to the side. She also poses with both hands on her hips, or in pant pockets. This further instills a sense of confidence in front of the camera. If you want to look like Megan Fox, you should take time to be comfortable with the way you look and flaunt your best physical characteristics. Even if there aren't paparazzi around to photograph you, the people you meet in day-to-day life will surely pick up on your confidence."

      "title": "Wear bold colours.",
      "content": "Wear bold colours. Megan usually attends red carpet events wearing dresses in solid, bold colours. Whether she chooses a red, a purple, an orange or a burgundy depends on her mood and the event itself. Choosing a monochromatic dress will make a bold statement, and make a strong eye-catcher for any around you. If it's a more relaxed event you're attending, you may want to follow Megan's suit and try out a white or light pink dress. This will convey a similar degree of glamour, but won't carry the same weight of assertiveness inherent in bolder colours."

      "title": "Wear dresses that accentuate your body.",
      "content": "Wear dresses that accentuate your body. Megan Fox likes to choose dresses that show off her natural looks without being too revealing. She loves to wear strapless dresses to show off her back, or sleeveless dresses when she wants to showcase her toned arms. Megan is also a fan of high slits in dresses. These slits allow her to show off her legs. Though she wears a lot of knee or floor length dresses, she commonly wears short dresses. Ultimately, you should choose a dress that manages to be elegant while staying simple, and one that opts to emphasize parts of your body as opposed to making a fresh statement of its own. Megan pairs her dresses with super high stiletto heels. The added height from heels has a slimming effect on the wearer."

      "content": "Keep most of your wardrobe casual. Although you might think to get glamorous if you're trying to look like a movie star, Megan Fox is arguably even better known for how casually she tends to dress away from the red carpet. She wears leggings and skinny jeans paired with plain or printed t-shirts. On her feet, she'll often wear sandals or flat boots. She's also a fan of wearing sweatshirts. Ultimately, if you're trying to be fashionable like Megan Fox, you should generally aim for comfort over flair. This has the effect of showing people you're naturally confident even while casual, and that can leave just as much of an impression as any red carpet model. Megan wears baseball caps sometimes while out shopping or running errands. That way, she's hopefully able to maintain some anonymity while she's out and about. [7] X Research source"
