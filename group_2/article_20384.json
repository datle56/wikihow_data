      "content": "Strike up a friendship with him. There’s nothing wrong with being a good friend to someone you like. Focus on being a positive force in his life, all while exploring a new friendship. This way, you’re creating an opportunity for a spark to form, but you’re not crossing any lines, and you’re not forcing anything to happen. If a connection blooms, then it might've just been meant to be! [1] X Research source There’s no reason to overthink how you’ll approach him—just go up and talk to him! It’s always nice to build rapport and make a new buddy. Some guys like to come to the rescue and help out. To give him that opportunity, ask for some support that’s not a major inconvenience: “Can you help me practice these vocab words? I want to make sure I’m ready for my skit in French class!”"

      "content": "Lend an ear whenever he wants to talk. When you get to know a guy , let him do most of the talking, especially if he’s naturally chatty. He might be used to having a girlfriend who dominates the conversation—you never know, and if that’s the case, then you score a really big advantage just by using active listening skills . Show him how much you enjoy listening to him: lock eyes with him, lean in, smile, and nod. He may get addicted to all the attention. [2] X Research source Ask him lots of follow-up questions to prove you’re invested in the convo: “That’s so cool that you’re trying to make it to the League of Legends World Championship. Is there a cash prize if you win?” Watch for what lights him up and sparks his excitement. If he brags about himself a bit, make sure to compliment him and give him tons of praise. He’ll love how you stroke his ego and want to keep you around."

      "content": "Be a shoulder to cry on. If you want a guy to see you as a potential love interest, make sure you’re there for him through the thick and the thin. As your friendship develops, remain emotionally supportive . Listen and sympathize whenever he’s going through a hard time. Whether he gets a bad grade on a paper or a negative remark at work, reassure him that you like him unconditionally. He’ll know he doesn’t need to pretend to be fine, and he’ll grow to crave your kindness and sensitivity. [3] X Research source Let him know you’re always available for him, including in person, over the phone, or via text. He’ll realize you’re super reliable and dependable. Check in about whether he just wants to vent or if he’d like you to brainstorm solutions to any of his problems. He’ll dig how flexible and understanding you are."

      "content": "Have deep conversations with him. As you build your connection, move from small talk to more serious topics. Discuss subjects that show off your smarts —your intelligence and substance will give you an extra edge. If he feels he can cover any territory with you, from philosophy to childhood experiences, he might dream of having you as a partner. After all, you’ll show off that you’re enchanting and mentally stimulating.

Brush up on the news and current events—you can be his go-to source for any recent developments, and he’ll be impressed on how you stay on top of everything. Dive into subjects you’re passionate about. For example, if you're into history, share what you recently read about the Middle Ages. If you're into science, talk about the documentary on sharks you watched the night before."

      "content": "Send “innocently” flirty texts. If you’re on a texting basis with him, then you can create some really fun tension and anticipation. Start off slow—send funny memes, commiserate over tough assignments or work, or chat about a new movie you just watched. Open up about yourself so he can see how interesting your life is and imagine being part of it. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Texts are also a great way to gauge his interest level in you. If he responds to all your messages, it’s a sign you're on really good terms with him. If you notice that he ignores your texts, don’t take it personally. He might just have certain boundaries on account of having a girlfriend. Be patient and stay friendly—over time, you may have a better chance of dating him. When he lightly flirts with you by making cheeky comments or using fun emojis (like “😉” or “😇”) roll with it and seize the moment—fire back with an equally saucy message (such as '' I knew you’d like that. 😈🤘\")."

Show off your wittiness, funniness, and spontaneity to get on their good side. Keep it light and fun and they’ll probably tell him how much they like you. His thoughts might drift to how compatible you are and how well you fit into his life.

Go to source Avoid outright flirting with his friends—it can really backfire, and he might try to be nice and set you up with one of them. Just keep it chill so he sees you as someone he’d want to date. If you think that your guy might vie to be the “Alpha” of his friend group, it’s totally fine if his buddies get crushes on you. This could just add to your appeal, and your love interest might fight to steal your attention from them."

Play video games, watch a movie, catch up over coffee, or have lunch with each other. If you want to play it safe, suggest a study date at the library. If you can get him alone, you’re much more likely to build some amazing chemistry with him. [7] X Research source"

These harmless tactics keep you on his good side, so if he ever breaks up with his girlfriend, you’re in a great position to land him as your boyfriend.

You won’t win any points pining for him, so just let loose and enjoy yourself!"

[9] X Research source It’s okay to put in a little more effort to give him something to comment on or quietly admire. Get a haircut or try a new hairstyle.

      "content": "Briefly catch his eye. One of the most low-key but powerful ways to acknowledge a mutual attraction is to lock eyes with each other. When you like someone, it can be so hard to avert your eyes—so if they end up on him every once in a while, that’s hardly your fault! Let him know you caught him staring at you and act coy by giving him a little smile. Then, glance away quickly—you two will spark up a “forbidden fruit” dynamic worthy of a rom-com, and he’ll definitely keep thinking of you.

For example, if he thinks she’s too nit-picky, point out all of his strengths and talents. While you shouldn’t mold yourself into someone you’re not, you’ll build a tight connection if you play up the parts of yourself that he’s most attracted to. [12] X Research source Remember, if he’s going to leave his girlfriend for you, it should be to date the real you. Only shine a spotlight on the qualities you actually have rather than adopting a fake personality."

Just stick to what’s totally cool between friends with a slight flirtatious edge. For example, if he tells a killer joke, giggle and touch his shoulder or playfully pat his chest. [13] X Research source Try to put him in a protective role when you touch him. For example, hold onto his arm while you bend over to adjust the strap of your shoe. Be a warm, nurturing presence, too. If he’s had a bad day, you can wrap your arms around him. Alternatively, if you’ve had a tough time, let him come to the rescue—when you’re sitting down and chatting, lean your head on his shoulder and sigh."

To spice up the dynamic, date around to show that you’re attractive and desirable to other people. When he sees that new love interests are pursuing you, your crush might get totally jealous. He may even start to chase you to feel like he still has a chance. [14] X Research source Casually mention the new guy you’re dating and bring him to group outings. When your crush sees the two of you together, he may wish you were with him, instead. Don’t go overboard with the PDA. If you dote on the dude who’s just the “placeholder,” you might give the guy you really like the wrong message. Dating other guys also gives you the opportunity to meet new guys. One of these guys might be better than the guy you're trying to win. And here's the best part: these guys are already single (and into you!)."

Breaking up with his girlfriend is a huge decision, so allow him to navigate it in a way that’s best for him. Be patient and you’ll truly earn his trust. Once he’s called things off, he’s likely to run into your arms because you’ve always been there for him. [15] X Research source Avoid bringing up the idea of dating until he's broken things off with his girlfriend. If he keeps telling you he'll do it soon but never does, he probably isn't actually ready to move on."
