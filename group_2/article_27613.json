Minecraft stresses both your CPU and GPU, so both may need to be upgraded to see significant gains. Installing more RAM will likely not make much of a difference unless Minecraft is using 100% of your RAM. You are unlikely going to be able to upgrade a laptop beyond potentially adding some extra RAM. See Install RAM for details on replacing and upgrading laptop memory. On top of adding more memory, consider getting faster memory with lower timings. Also consider having two sticks in dual-channel, rather than the usual one. Also bear in mind that windows 10 (any edition) is quite capable of using 4Gb or so of ram just for basic tasks. If you're getting a new CPU, you'll likely need a new motherboard as well. See Install a New Processor for details. Installing a graphics card is one of the easier upgrades, as long as you ensure you have enough space in your computer case for it. See Install a Graphics Card for details."
