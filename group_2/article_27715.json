      "content": "Run a full wash cycle with 1 c (240 mL) of vinegar. Instead of adding any laundry detergent, use just white vinegar for this load, pouring it into the slot where your detergent would usually go. [1] X Research source If you’re washing lighter towels, stick with a warm-water cycle; if you’re washing darker towels; opt for a hot-water cycle. Your towels will probably smell of vinegar once the cycle’s done, but that's okay! [2] X Research source Make sure that your washer is no more than 75% full, as you don’t want to overload the machine. Don't wash anything else with the new towels, or else the colors may bleed. Alternative: Wait until you’ve started a warm- or -hot-water cycle and pause the load once the washer fills completely. Then, pour in the vinegar."

(Don’t worry—the vinegar has washed out, so you don’t need to worry about creating a mess.) Leave them in the washer and let it fill up with hot water again. Use the same settings that you used the first time."

Warning: Do not mix the vinegar and baking soda in the same wash cycle! This will cause a large chemical reaction that will probably lead to a big, foamy mess and could cause damage to your laundry machine."

Take the amount of laundry you planned to do in one load and divide it into two equal piles so that you have two loads. Consider doing loads of only towels instead of throwing them in with other laundry. [8] X Research source Your towels won't be washed as thoroughly if you're using large loads, which you definitely don’t want."

Towels feel pretty fluffy when you’re checking them out at the store—but this is typically because of the silicone that’s on the fibers, which prevents the cloth from being as absorbent. By washing your towels ahead of time, they’ll soak up a lot more water whenever you use them next. [10] X Research source"
