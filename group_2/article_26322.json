      "content": "Play up your upper body if you're pear-shaped. Wear loose blouses and form-fitting skirts and pants to help your smaller half look more proportionate to your fuller bottom half. Avoid wearing baggy pants and peasant skirts, as these can make your hips and thighs look larger than they actually are. [1] X Research source You have a pear-shaped body if your bust measurement is smaller than your hip measurement. You carry more weight around your butt, hips, and thighs."

      "content": "Accentuate your bottom half if you're cone-shaped. Avoid a lot of detailing and design on the top half, and have more fun with the lower half to even out your appearance. Try skirts that flare out, pants with big pockets, and other fun bottoms. [3] X Research source If you're cone-shaped, you'll have larger shoulders and bust. Your hips will be smaller.

      "content": "Enhance your curves if you have a straight body type. Get creative with layers and accessories. Try shirts with ruffles along the shoulders or bust, or skirts that flare out.

If this describes you, it’s a great idea to accentuate that waist."

      "content": "In general, accentuate your waist no matter your body shape. Your waist can be at your true waist, but it can also be somewhere else, like right under your bust.

      "content": "Pick fabrics with structure. Flimsy, lightweight fabrics may seem breezy and casual, but they can cling to your body and actually become a bit uncomfortable. Fabrics that are a bit more substantial will make you look svelte and smooth. They offer support while also concealing any lines from undergarments. You don’t need to write off fabrics like silk and cotton forever, but be sure to try different fabrics to find what feels best to you."

There is nothing wrong with embracing a flowy, boho style, but try on other options too. The next time you go out clothes shopping, take something you wouldn't normally wear into the fitting room with you. You may like something you never expected to! [8] X Research source You don’t need to buy any of the clothing you try, and you don’t need to show anyone. Just try to be open-minded about other styles of clothing. Remember, you won’t know how something looks on you unless you give it a try. Choose clothes that aren't necessarily tight but that skim your body, are comfortable, and show your shape underneath.

For a sleek look, try creating monochromatic outfits with various textures. If you want to wear stripes, opt for thin, light-colored stripes on a darker background.
