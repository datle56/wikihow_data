      "title": "Take pictures of any damage to your vehicle.",
      "content": "Take pictures of any damage to your vehicle. During the day, walk around your vehicle and inspect it for any scratches or marks that weren’t there before. Be sure to check all of the panels and doors thoroughly. Use your phone to take pictures and document the marks. Pictures are important for keeping a record of the damage and are helpful when you submit the case to law enforcement or your insurance provider."

      "content": "Check any security cameras near where you parked. Look around your parked car for any CCTV or security cameras that could have filmed the person keying your car. Let the camera owners know that your vehicle was keyed, and ask them for a copy of the footage. If you’re lucky, the vandal may be caught on tape."

      "title": "File a report with your local police department.",
      "content": "File a report with your local police department. When you contact the police to file a report , give them all the information you have about the incident. Tell them the make and model for your vehicle, describe the damage, and explain when it happened. If you suspect anyone or have them on film, share it with the authorities as well so they have a better chance at catching the vandal. Even if you don’t have evidence about who keyed your car, filing a police report and having it on record will make filing an insurance report easier. In most areas, keying a car is considered vandalism and is considered illegal. Someone who keys a car may also get charged with defacing or destruction of property. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Contact your car insurance provider to start a claim.",
      "content": "Contact your car insurance provider to start a claim. Most insurance providers only cover damage from keying a car if you have their comprehensive coverage, which covers damage caused off the road. Reach out to your insurance company and let them know what happened. Explain the incident and send them pictures of the damage to see if they’ll cover repairs. [2] X Research source You may still need to pay a deductible, which is a set amount you pay directly before insurance covers the rest of the cost. If you don’t have comprehensive coverage, then insurance will not normally cover the damage. It still doesn’t hurt to contact your provider and ask if there’s anything they can do to help, though."

Wipe the scratch with a lint-free cloth to remove any dirt or dust from the surface. [3] X Research source How can you tell if only the clear coat is scratched? Spray the mark with rubbing alcohol first. If the mark disappears and then reappears a few seconds later, then the scratch is only on the surface. If the mark is still visible, then the paint is scratched . [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Tape off the area around the scratch.",
      "content": "Tape off the area around the scratch. Apply strips of masking tape about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above and below the key mark on your vehicle. Rip the ends of the tape so each strip is the same length as the scratch. [5] X Research source Taping the area helps you remember where the scratch is located once you start working and prevents you from doing more sanding than you need to."

      "content": "Wet-sand the scratch with 3,000-grit sandpaper . Spray the scratched area with soapy water and wet your sandpaper as well. Gently rub the surface with your sandpaper perpendicular to the key mark. Sand for about 15 seconds before wiping the surface dry with a towel. If you still see a mark, keep sanding until you remove the scratch . [6] X Research source Avoid applying too much pressure while you’re sanding because you could eat through the clear coat and start removing paint. Try wrapping your sandpaper around a sponge to help sand the surface more evenly."

Try to remove any sharp or rough edges from the paint so your touch-up applies smoothly. When you’re finished, wipe the scratch with a damp cloth to get rid of dust. [11] X Research source If you notice any rust around the scratch, continue sanding it until it’s completely removed. If you paint over rust, the finish could bubble."

Apply a thin layer of paint over the scratch and let it dry for about 5 minutes. Keep adding coats until you can’t see the scratch and the touch-up paint is higher than the base color. [12] X Research source If you can’t find the paint color code on the door, check on the sticker by the gas cap.

Then, move up to 1,500-grit and 2,000-grit sandpaper to blend the area in even more. Finally, wet-sand the spot one more time with 3,000-grit and 5,000-grit sandpaper . [15] X Research source Wipe off any dust or debris after changing sandpaper grits to check the area you’re working on. If the clear coat feels level with the rest of the surface, then it’s time to move on. Use straight back-and-forth movements following the direction of the scratch. Avoid using circular motions because circular scratches are more difficult to remove later on."

      "content": "Take your vehicle to a body shop for large scratches that expose bare metal. If the scratches penetrate through the clear coat and paint, it makes your vehicle more prone to rust, leading to more expensive repairs later. As soon as you notice the marks, contact local body shops to assess the damage and get price quotes. [17] X Research source How much does repairing a keyed car cost? The cost varies depending on the sizes of the key marks and the extent of the damage. If the mark is small and only on one panel, it may cost less than $100 USD. For long key marks on multiple panels, you may spend over $500 USD. If insurance will cover the damage, they may provide a list of body shops where you can take your vehicle. Avoid taking your vehicle to a detailer because they won’t be able to buff out scratches that go through the paint and clear coat."

They may use a car key, nail, or any other sharp object to leave marks on the doors or panels. While there are multiple motives for why someone may key a vehicle, some of the main reasons are: [18] X Research source Someone is upset or getting revenge against you. Someone is jealous of you. Someone gets a thrill damaging another person’s property. Someone was targeting another person with the same vehicle."

While key marks and scratches can be difficult to distinguish, normal scratches tend to be shorter or more randomly placed. If your vehicle was keyed, the marks tend to run parallel to the ground and extend the length of the panel they’re on. Key marks may also form words or have a zigzag pattern."

Otherwise, try to find a spot on a busy street that’s well-lit. That way, someone is less likely to key your car because they could easily get caught. [19] X Research source Look for parking spots near other vehicles as well. If there are more vehicles around, it could discourage a vandal from targeting you."

      "content": "Install security cameras or a dashcam . Put up outdoor security cameras in your normal parking area, or leave dashcams inside of your vehicle. If a vandal notices they’re being filmed, they’ll avoid keying your vehicle. If they do still vandalize your car, then you at least have evidence against them that you can give to the authorities. [20] X Research source If you can’t afford security cameras, try installing motion-activated lights to scare people away from your vehicle."

      "content": "Start a neighborhood watch program . If there have been multiple cases of keyed vehicles in your area, reach out to your neighbors and discuss the issue. Ask everyone to keep their eyes out for suspicious activity and report it to law enforcement right away so you can keep your community safe. Choose a couple people in your neighborhood to be “block captains.” Block captains help invite new residents to join and are the main points of contact for other members of the community."

Because people usually key cars when they’re angry or upset, try to be nice and personable with the people you interact with each day. Be your best self and avoid pushing someone’s buttons if you’re not sure how they’ll react. If you’re kind and communicative with other people, they’ll have less reason to vandalize your vehicle.
