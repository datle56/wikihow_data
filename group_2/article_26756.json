      "title": "Choose a food-grade plastic or glass container with an airlock.",
      "content": "Choose a food-grade plastic or glass container with an airlock. The size of your container will depend on the size of the batch you’re making. If you want to make 5.5–6 US gal (21–23 l) of alcohol, choose a container that holds at least 8 US gal (30 l). [1] X Research source You can use a large jug or bucket . If you use a bucket, make sure it has a food-grade lid with an airtight seal. You’ll probably need to purchase your airlock separately. This is a transparent gadget that releases CO2 from the container without letting in oxygen. If you’re using a container with a lid, drill a hole into the lid that’s the same diameter as the rubber grommet that comes with your airlock (or purchase a bucket that already has a grommet for an airlock). Push the grommet securely into the hole securely. If you use a jug, choose an airlock with a rubber stopper that will fit into the mouth of the jug."

      "content": "Sterilize the equipment with brewing sanitizer. Use a brew sanitizer to rinse your fermentation vessel (the bucket or jug), along with every accessory you’ll use, including the rubber stopper or container lid and airlock, plus a long-handled spoon and a funnel. [2] X Research source Most sanitizers should not be rinsed after you use them, but follow the instructions on the label."

      "content": "Dissolve 14 lb (6.4 kg) of sugar in 2 US gal (7.6 l) of distilled water. Heat the water in a large pot on the stove, then slowly stir in the sugar until it’s completely dissolved. If the sugar doesn’t dissolve even after the water is at or near boiling, add a little more water to the pot. With these measurements, you should get about 6.6 US gal (25 l) of alcohol. If you’re using regular yeast, you’ll probably get a result of around 10% alcohol by volume (ABV). To get a spirit with higher alcohol content—closer to 15–20%—use a yeast meant for distilling, like Turbo yeast . [3] X Research source If you want to lower the alcohol in the finished spirit, use less sugar. You can also use a sugar wash calculator to determine how much water and sugar to use based on your desired total output or ABV."

      "title": "Add the sugar water and remaining fresh water to the fermenting vessel.",
      "content": "Add the sugar water and remaining fresh water to the fermenting vessel. When all of the sugar has been dissolved, carefully pour the sugar and water solution into the container you're using as a fermentation vessel. Add cool, distilled water to reach your total desired volume—for the recipe we’re using here, add water until you have a total of 6.6 US gal (25 l). Leave about 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) worth of space at the top of the container. This allows room for the foam and gases that form during fermentation. If you don’t leave enough room, the pressure can build and pop the lid on the vessel, leading to contamination."

      "title": "Let the mixture cool to 100 °F (38 °C), then add one packet of yeast.",
      "content": "Let the mixture cool to 100 °F (38 °C), then add one packet of yeast. Use a cooking thermometer to check the sugar water mixture in your container. If it’s higher than 100 °F (38 °C), let the container cool off until it’s the right temperature—if the water is too hot, it will kill the yeast. Then, pour in one packet of yeast and stir until there are no clumps of yeast left floating in the water. [4] X Research source You can use any type of yeast you like for this, as long as it’s active—yeasts intended for champagne , beer , or wine may give you the best flavor, but instant dry yeast will also work. Follow the instructions on the yeast packet—some may direct you to hydrate the yeast in a small amount of water before adding it to the larger batch. Some people like to add yeast nutrients at this stage to help feed the yeast—it’s not strictly necessary, but it may help speed up the fermentation process."

      "title": "Add the lid and airlock.",
      "content": "Add the lid and airlock. If you’re using a plastic bucket, tightly push the lid onto the bucket to form an airtight seal. If you’re using a jug, push the stopper into the neck of the jug securely. Then, push your airlock into the opening in the lid or stopper. [5] X Research source Fermentation is an anaerobic (lacking oxygen) process, so an airtight seal is necessary for proper fermentation."

      "title": "Fill the airlock halfway with water or vodka.",
      "content": "Fill the airlock halfway with water or vodka. Adding clean water or vodka to the inside of the airlock allows carbon dioxide to be released from the fermenting solution while air is kept out. The drop in available oxygen will cause the yeast to stop multiplying and start producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. [6] X Research source If the fermenting bucket is sealed without an airlock to vent the fermentation gases, the bucket will explode and most likely make a huge mess."

      "content": "Let the mixture ferment for about 2–7 days at 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C). If the mixture is fermenting, you’ll start seeing bubbles in the airlock within a few hours. Keep an eye on that bubbling over the next few days—when it stops, the mixture is finished fermenting. The exact time to ferment the mixture will vary depending on the type of yeast used and how much sugar you added. In some cases, this can take as little as 2 days. [7] X Research source However, it’s more likely to take around a week. Keeping the mixture at a temperature of 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) will promote optimum performance from the yeast. Use a refractometer if you want to measure the exact alcohol percentage in your finished spirit. Once the fermentation stops, it is time to purify the alcohol."

      "title": "Add a clearing agent to clarify the fermented alcoholic liquid.",
      "content": "Add a clearing agent to clarify the fermented alcoholic liquid. After fermentation is complete, use a clearing agent (also called a fining agent) to remove suspended yeast and other material that may be present. After you add the finings, reseal the fermenter with the lid or stopper and the airlock and allow the liquid to clarify for two or three days. [8] X Research source If you’re using isinglass, a common clearing agent, add 0.5 to 1.0 gram of isinglass per 5 gallons (19 L) of batch. Try to find isinglass that doesn't contain sulphites, as some people are allergic to sulphites."

Leave the unwanted sediment behind in the fermentation vessel. If you need to, leave a little of the alcohol behind—the solids in the bottom of the container will give the spirits an unpleasant texture. Don't store the alcoholic liquid in the fermenting vessel for more than a month as it can oxidize over time."

If you’d like, you can flavor the sugar wash by adding lemon juice, lime juice, or a liqueur essence like Amaretto. [9] X Research source Some people make sugar washes to distill into a stronger spirit, but this is illegal in the U.S."

Fermenting your own sugar wash is legal in the U.S.— making homebrewed wine and beer is legal on a federal level, and this is a similar fermentation process. You’ll likely achieve an alcohol concentration similar to wine or a strong beer. Every state has its own laws around homebrewing, though, so check your state's statutes to be sure it's legal where you live.

And because the fruit will add flavor to the finished spirit, the result usually tastes a lot better than making alcohol from sugar. [11] X Research source Good options for homemade wine include grape juice , blackberries , watermelon , oranges , or pomegranates ."
