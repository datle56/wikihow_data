Any fabric can be used for a dress, although if it is your first time try working with an easy natural or cotton blend. Look for pretty fabrics that meet your color, pattern, and texture needs. Using silky or heavy fabrics are difficult to sew without a bit of practice. Additionally, choose a fabric that is thick enough that it won’t require two layers or a slip. You will need between 2–3 yards (1.8–2.7 m) of fabric total depending on your size and the length of the dress. [2] X Research source Try using a large over sized t-shirt as the base for your dress. These can be found in thrift stores or even in the back of your own closet. Get creative with your fabric choice and try using a sheet or curtain as the fabric for your dress. You can thrift for pretty vintage versions of these fabrics if you don’t have any at home you’re willing to cut up."

Lay your fabric flat (or folded in half, if the pattern directs you to do so) and place your pattern over the top. Follow your traced lines and the guide to cut out your fabric in the matching shapes. [8] X Research source If you are using a dress for the pattern use your traced outline of half the dress, drawn after being folded in half and placed along the folded edge. Cut along this line, and unfold the fabric to expose a complete front of your dress. Add ½ inch of extra fabric around the edges of the dress for seam allowances. Most patterns already have this included in their measurements, but you will need to keep this in mind if you are tracing a dress for your pattern. If you want to add sleeves to your dress, these will need to be cut as separate pieces from the body of the dress. Cut your dress fabric in a tank-style top and then sew your sleeves on later. Be sure to cut the fabric for the back of this dress as well at this point, using the same method as you did to cut the front."

Typically the sides of the dress will be sewn first. Turn your fabric inside-out and fold ¼ of an inch over on either side, using an iron to flatten it out. Then, use a zigzag stitch to sew the front and back together, and a top stitch to attach your newly formed seam to the body of the dress. The top stitch will help the fabric to lay flat along the seam and add a more professional look to your dress. Follow any specific directions on your pattern for sewing additional sections of your dress. If your pattern directs you to sew something other than the sides first, do so."
