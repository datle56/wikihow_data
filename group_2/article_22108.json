[1] X Research source Rank the activities you need and want to do in order of importance. Then, assign an appropriate amount of time to each one. Consistency is key for creating a healthy morning routine. Life coach Jennifer Butler says, “If we only do something one or two times, it doesn’t come naturally. Once you do something for 30 days or so, it creates a new habit.” [2] X Expert Source Jennifer Butler, MSW Love & Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. Organizational expert Kathi Burns recommends pre-planning your day: “If you find yourself running behind all the time, you haven’t thought about it in advance and you’re in reaction mode as [opposed] to being proactive.

      "content": "Make compromises. If you have a partner, children, and/or friends, you must also consider their needs alongside your own. Sometimes, you’ll have to make compromises for them, and other times, you’ll have to compromise time with them for other things you have to do. This is a sometimes unfortunate but necessary part of having a balanced life. Learn how and when to say no to avoid overcommitting yourself. [4] X Research source For example, spending more time with your family may impact your job opportunities and income. If you spend more time at work, however, you’ll have less time with your loved ones. You must learn to balance these aspects of your life by making compromises. Butler says you must dismantle “that belief that you have to be available for everyone at all times and that people are going to fall apart if you’re not. The more you give yourself what you need, the better you show up as a human being, and then the better the people around you can also show up.” [5] X Expert Source Jennifer Butler, MSW Love & Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 31 July 2020."

If you have a tendency to expect the worst, try to focus things that can go well instead.

However, I know that I can take more exams and bring my grade up later.” Surround yourself with supportive people to help yourself stay positive. Try to limit your time with people who are negative or critical. To avoid negative thoughts , Butler says, “Start listening to them. Bring them to your awareness. You can even write them down and start noticing the pattern. If you think that you’re a failure and you never do anything right, that’s your theme. So flip the script and start writing down every success you’ve had.” [7] X Expert Source Jennifer Butler, MSW Love & Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 31 July 2020."
