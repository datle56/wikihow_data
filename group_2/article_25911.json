      "content": "There are a few things you can do to prepare for the Leviathan fight. This includes having certain equipment, fruits, and even a specific race. The Shark race is recommended because they take less Water damage. [1] X Research source If your character isn't Shark, you can use a Race Reroll that you can buy from the Shop, tort, or some event NPCs. The best weapons to bring are the Shark Anchor (because it can do more damage to the Leviathan) [2] X Research source or an Explosive Gun (a Cannon, Bazooka, or Soul Guitar ). [3] X Research source To get the Shark Anchor , use a Monster Magnet to spawn an \"irregular\" Terrorshark (one that has an anchor sticking out of it). Do at least 10% damage to the Terrorshark and defeat it to get the weapon. You should be at least level 2,300 before fighting the Leviathan, but higher levels are recommended to make the fight easier. The best fruits to bring are Buddha, Magma, Mammoth, or Dragon. Leopard, T-Rex, and Dough V2 fruits can also work. Sound and Phoenix fruits are good for support. The best Fighting Styles to use are Sharkman Karate or Sanguine Art. Dragon Talon can also work. You must have 5 players (including yourself) in your Sea Exploration Group to summon Leviathan, but more players is always better. The person driving the boat should have a Kitsune Mask to help navigate around rocks. To get a Kitsune Mask, you must turn in at least 15 Azure Embers to the Kitsune Shrine on Kitsune Island during the Blue Moon event. The mask has approximately a 10% chance to drop every time you do this. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Bribe the Spy. The Spy is near a tree on the roof of the middle temple. [5] X Research source To drastically improve your chances of finding the Frozen Dimension (which is where the Leviathan spawns), you can bribe the Spy on top of the middle temple. One bribe costs 1,500 Fragments , and you shouldn't need to spend more than 6,000 Fragments total to get the Spy to give you the Leviathan hint. If the Spy says \"The Leviathan is out there! Go find it before it causes more destruction\" your chances of finding the Frozen Dimension have been raised. If the Spy says \"I don't know anything yet\" you're on an invisible Spy cooldown. You must complete 10-20 Sea Events to bribe the Spy again. The bribes can be paid by multiple people. It doesn't have to be paid all by the same player. If you opt to not bribe the Spy or if you're on Spy cooldown, the Frozen Dimension can still spawn. However, the chance is much lower, so bribing the Spy is highly recommended."
