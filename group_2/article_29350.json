      "content": "Decide on a song. Pick a song that you want to use for your YouTube music video. You'll generally want to pick a song that's popular enough to receive attention, but not so popular that several people have already created lyric videos. Avoid using recently released music, as artists often request that their recent songs be unavailable anywhere but on their official pages."

If you're using a Mac, play the song once in order to place it in your iTunes library. Keep in mind that YouTube will often flag music that wasn't purchased as copyright violation."

The easiest way to find accurate, verified lyrics for your song is by going to the Genius website at https://genius.com/ , entering your song name into the search bar in the top-left corner of the screen, and reviewing the results. You can also just type your song's name and the word \"lyrics\" (e.g., three little birds lyrics ) into a search engine. Accurate, grammatically correct lyrics generally fare better on YouTube than do inaccurate, misspelled lyrics."
