      "title": "Place the pike on a landing mat.",
      "content": "Place the pike on a landing mat. This gives you a flat surface to lay the pike on. This is particularly useful if you are on a rocky or muddy surface. For large pike, use a landing mat that is at least 1 metre (3.3 ft) wide and long, as this gives room for the pike to lie flat. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a landing mat, place the pike on the flattest nearby surface."

      "title": "Slip your fingertips between the gills and the plates.",
      "content": "Slip your fingertips between the gills and the plates. When catching many fish, it is common practice to hold them by the gills. However, it is as important not to use this grip on pike fish, as they have teeth in their gills. Instead, pull the gill flap back and place 3 or 4 fingertips into the cavity between the gills and the gill plate. You will be able to see clearly see the space that is free of teeth! Use your free hand to hold down the fish. [2] X Research source | If the pike’s head is pointing toward the left, place your left fingertips between the gills and the plates. Alternatively, if the head pointing toward the right, place your right fingertips between the gills and the plates. The gill flap is located underneath the mouth of the fish. The gill plate is the roof of the gill cavity."

      "content": "Clench your fingertips toward yourself to control the jaw of the pike. Bend the fingertips on your hand that is in the gill flap as close to the palm of your hand as you can. This gives you a firm grip on the jaw of the pike and allows you to carry the bulk of its weight. Use your free hand to stop the fish from moving around too much. [3] X Research source Avoid putting your whole fingers into the gill plates, as this can cause them to sit near the teeth. Instead, simply put your fingertips up to your second knuckle into the fish.

      "content": "Support its belly when taking photos or putting it back in the water. When picking up a pike that is more than about 2.5 kilograms (5.5 lb), it is especially important to place 1 hand underneath its belly. This helps to support its organs and also gives you a more secure grip on the fish. [5] X Research source Avoid holding the fish vertically, as this can put unnecessary pressure on its organs. [6] X Research source Use your spare hand to support the belly."

      "title": "Lay the pike on a landing mat.",
      "content": "Lay the pike on a landing mat. This provides a flat and grippy surface to lay the pike. Place the pike on the middle of the mat to keep it from wriggling back into the water. Purchase a landing mat online or from a fishing store. [7] X Research source Small pike are less than 2 kilograms (4.4 lb). As a result, any regular sized landing mat is appropriate for this sized fish."

      "title": "Grip the neck with a firm hold.",
      "content": "Grip the neck with a firm hold. Wrap your dominant hand right around the neck of the pike, just below the mouth. This grip is the best option for small pike, as the traditional gill hold that is used on larger pike shouldn’t be used on these fish due to their small gill cavities. [8] X Research source If the fish is particularly wriggly, put on a pair of gloves to give yourself a better grip."

      "content": "Hold the pike in the middle of the belly to support its organs. Avoid holding the pike vertically, as this puts a lot of pressure on its organs. Instead, lift up the belly of the fish with your free hand to bring it to a horizontal position. This also helps to stop the pike from moving. [9] X Research source This grip is particularly useful for taking a photo with the pike."
