      "content": "Your sex drive, or libido, refers to how often you desire sex. Your libido is influenced by your hormone levels, medical health, emotional comfort, and other factors. The point is, your body will let you know when it’s interested in getting frisky. Just keep in mind, a high sex drive is no big deal so long as you’re happy. [1] X Research source There is no “normal” libido. Some people want to have sex every day while others are only interested in sex weekly or so. If you’re content with the way you are and you have no other medical symptoms, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a high libido. However, if there’s an underlying issue causing this, it’s best to address it."
