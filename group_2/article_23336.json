Apart from the violin marking behind their heads, these spiders don't have any variation in color on either their bodies or their legs, including their undersides. [2] X Research source If the spider has stripes or other markings on its body or legs, it's not a brown recluse. Spiders with darker abdomens or several different colors on their bodies also aren't brown recluses. For example, huntsman spiders and funnel weavers are often mistaken for brown recluses, but they have different colors on their bodies and legs. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Violin marking This dark brown marking appears on the brown recluse's cephalothorax—typically people will just refer to this as the spider's back, although that's not completely accurate. The neck of the violin points toward the spider's body. The shape isn't always super well-defined, though, so it can be hard to spot. [4] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Other types of spiders have similar markings, so this alone isn't enough to guarantee you're looking at a brown recluse."

      "content": "Six eyes The brown recluse's unique eye configuration is usually an easier way to identify them than other markings. While most spiders have 8 eyes, a brown recluse has only 6, arranged in 3 pairs—one directly in the center of their head with the other 2 pairs on either side. [5] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source The eyes are so small it can be difficult to actually see them without a magnifying glass. If you're going to hold a magnifying glass up to a live spider, be careful! A woodlouse spider also has 6 eyes, but they're in a different configuration. Woodlouse spiders tend to be reddish with a dark-reddish brown front half, pale back half, and gray abdomen. [6] X Research source"

If you've got a big, scary-looking spider, it's probably not a brown recluse. These small spiders can sit comfortably on the head of a US quarter, including their legs.

When you notice a bite, clean it carefully with soap and warm water. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The area around the bite might become red or swollen within 3-8 hours after the bite.
