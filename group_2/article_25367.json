      "content": "Take a tone-deaf test. Tone deafness is a condition wherein some people aren't able to properly perceive the pitch of a given sound. There are several tone-deafness tests available online that can help you figure out if you struggle to perceive and match tones. [2] X Research source Find out if you can distinguish between low and high notes, or if you're part of the 1.5% of the population with \"amusia\" who cannot differentiate pitch, tone, and even rhythm. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Most online tone deafness tests consist of several short clips from well-known songs or tunes. Listen to the clip, then indicate on the test form whether or not it was played correctly. Tone deafness does not mean you have an inherently bad voice, but it can indicate that you struggle to match your voice to the tune of the song you’re singing. Likewise, struggling to control your singing voice does not mean you’re tone deaf. There are a lot of factors that contribute to being a good singer, and it may be that you simply need to work more on honing vocal control."

      "content": "Ask for a second opinion from people you trust. Just like singing for friends or family, playing your recording back for a few trusted people can help you get insight into what others think of your singing. If you have a friend who is a strong singer, ask them for more technical critiques. If your audience doesn’t have a strong singing background, ask them for their initial reactions. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Pick people who you trust to give you honest feedback. Don’t look for someone you know will tell you that you’re great no matter what, and don’t trust someone who is prone to tearing you down even when you’re doing well. Warm up your vocal cords before singing to protect them from damage, just like you’d warm up before exercising. Chapman recommends warming up your whole body first by eating, drinking water, showering, and even exercising. To warm up your voice, she advises stretching your vocal cords—”you're essentially going up in pitch and down in pitch” to do so—until you feel ready to sing."

      "content": "Perform for others to get an outside opinion. If you’re looking for constructive feedback from others, try singing to an audience. Ask your friends or family to sit down for a small concert. Go to an open mic night at a club or lounge, sign up for a talent show, or do karaoke. Just find a venue where you’re comfortable and give it a go. Pick a room that will help you present your voice at its best. A large room with high ceilings will make your voice sound better than a carpeted basement with low ceilings will. When your performance is finished, ask your audience to give you an honest opinion. Remember that some individuals may try to spare your feelings, while others are hyper-critical. Look for an average consensus rather than taking any one opinion too hard. Another way to get feedback from the public is by busking in a train station or in a busy shopping area. If you can, set up a microphone and a small amplifier and see if people will stop to hear you sing. Make sure you have all necessary permissions from whoever owns or regulates the property first. Some areas, such as subway stations, may require city permits."

      "content": "Find your vocal range. To give yourself the best shot possible when evaluating your singing voice, you first need to find your vocal range . There are a number of apps and websites with rangefinder tools that can help you determine your natural range in a matter of minutes, such as the Nail the Pitch app. You can also find your vocal range by recording and listening to yourself as you sing. [5] X Research source If you use an app to find your vocal range, you will be directed to record your voice using your phone's microphone. Depending on the app, you may be able to record anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, generally singing the song of your choice. The app will then take the median frequencies of your voice to give you your general range. Vocal ranges can be broken up into voice types. From highest to lowest, the voice types are soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto, countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. Each voice type also has subcategories, such as lyric and dramatic, to help better characterize individual vocal abilities."

      "content": "Choose a song in your vocal range to record. Once you know your range, look for a song that matches your voice type for you to record. Singing a cappella (without accompaniment) isn't the best way to figure out if you have a good singing voice, so look for a song with a backing track or provide accompaniment for your tune. [6] X Research source It's important to give yourself a guide track, like a blank karaoke track, to find out whether or not you can match tones and stay in tune while you're singing. Blank karaoke tracks are readily available online through sites like YouTube. You can also check out the pre-programmed tracks on Casio keyboards, or the instrumental version of songs from albums you might have. Before you record, play around with songs in a few different keys. Find one that feels comfortable for you."

This means that to get an idea of how well you sing, the best way to hear yourself is through a recording. Use a voice recorder or the recorder app on your smartphone and sing at least 30 seconds of a tune. [7] X Research source While it’s not necessary to invest in fancy recording equipment to listen to yourself, you do want to make sure you’re using a quality recorder. If the recording app on your phone makes others’ voices sound weird, it will probably distort yours, too. If you're nervous about singing in front of others, this is a great way to get around performance anxiety. Nobody needs to hear your recording but you.

During your first listen, pay attention to how well you move through the song and your gut reaction when listening to your voice. Your instincts aren’t perfect critics, but they can tell you a lot. [9] X Research source Listen to the track in a variety of ways. Check it out on your cheap computer speakers, then plug the track in and listen to your car speakers, then check it out on headphones. Different qualities and types of speakers will give you different results. People are often their own worst critics. A gut reaction is important, but it should also be paired with further evaluation to help counter your more critical instincts."

      "content": "Pay attention to how well your voice can match the pitch of the backing track. After your initial listen, play your recording again and look for vocal control. Listen to make sure you are on key. This means that your voice should match the pitch of the backing for the song. [10] X Research source During this listen, you should also be wary of things like your voice cracking or unintentionally wavering. This can be a sign that you’re over-extending your vocals or that you don’t have full control of your range. Confused about finding your range? “Wherever you can hold a note for three seconds, I would call that your vocal range,” Chapman suggests. She advises first dropping your voice as low as you can by humming, and then going all the way up to ascertain the top end of your range."

Even if you’re singing all the right notes, if your tone is off or your timbre mismatches your song, it may still sound bad.

Stancato suggests you ask yourself what your voice is trying to do, and how you can support it while remaining curious, playful, and in love with singing."

Continue working on controlling your breathing, honing your pitch, and finding a musical style that matches your voice’s natural timbre. [14] X Research source Musical talent often develops side-by-side with musical aptitude. Start studying vocal techniques and learning about the voice as an instrument. The more you know about what goes into singing, the more you get out of your practice. You can train your body to help control the tone of your voice. Chapman explains that tone involves “using and anchoring your body, your intercostal, your ribs, your lungs, your pelvis,” as well as strengthening your vocal cords. Focus on strengthening your body and your voice."

      "content": "Correct your stance while singing. The right posture can make a world of difference in terms of your breathing and clarity while singing. Chapman explains that you want your back straight and chin up (but not jutting out). Think of it as if your whole head is being pulled upward. Try to spread your feet shoulder-width apart, too. [15] X Research source Keep some looseness in your stance so your body doesn’t stiffen up, as this can negatively affect your breathing."

[16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have any friends taking vocal lessons, ask them who they train with to get some recommendations. Choir teachers, local bands, and local a cappella groups may also have some good references for vocal coaches. Many vocal coaches will let you take an introductory lesson for free or for a discounted fee. Sign up for intro lessons from a few coaches to get an idea of who will work best with you. Did the coach encourage you to sing? Did they spend most of the lesson talking? Did they focus on just your voice, or on your physical technique as well?"
