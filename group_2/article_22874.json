      "content": "Start with a theme or vision to help simplify the rest of your decisions. Are you hosting a dinner party , or a blow-out with all your friends? Do you want something small and intimate or a big banger that no one forgets? [1] X Research source Consider doing something out of the ordinary—like hosting a murder mystery dinner or a Pi Day feast."

      "title": "Include a manageable amount of guests on your guest list.",
      "content": "Include a manageable amount of guests on your guest list. Consider the type of party you want to have. If you want close conversation, limit your invite list to 8-12 people. If you want a large, raging party, go bigger. You don’t have to invite everyone you know to every party. Consider what type of party it is (e.g., salsa dancing vs. a conversational dinner) and which guests would enjoy that event. Try to include at least one person on your guest list who can be the “life of the party” and fill any awkward silences . Assume everyone will say yes instead of inviting tons of people and hoping only a set amount can make it—you can always add more people later!"

      "content": "Send a paper, email, or text invite, depending on the formality of the event. Include an RSVP section and let people know what to expect at the party. Specify the dress code, like “black tie” for a formal event or “come as you are” for a casual get together. Describe any activities they should be prepared to participate in, like karaoke or a bake-off. [2] X Research source When inviting people to a party , give them at least 2-8 weeks notice. Let people know if they can bring a plus one, and specify whether children are allowed."

      "content": "Write down everything you need to do before the guests begin to arrive. This list will help you on the day of the party so as few things as possible get forgotten. Give yourself 1-2 hours more than you think you need to complete everything on the list, so that you don’t seem harried or stressed when guests arrive. [3] X Research source Let others help you complete the party preparations on your list. Hosting a party is a lot of work, so let others help you. If guests offer to bring side dishes, help prep before the party, or clean up afterward, let them!"

      "content": "Offer enough seating options for everyone on your guest list. If you're throwing a big party, remove anything delicate or breakable in advance to avoid costly and embarrassing mishaps. [4] X Research source Decorate with a few simple items—small touches go a long way with guests! [5] X Research source Try understated decor like: Colorful napkins that match the theme. Bouquets of fresh flowers. Festive balloons. Cute straws for cocktails and other drinks."

      "content": "Play upbeat or more lowkey music, depending on your party’s vibe. Make a playlist ahead of time and connect it to speakers or a computer that’s loud enough for your guests to hear (but not so loud it’s pounding in their ears!). [6] X Research source Use candles, a fireplace, or dim holiday lights to create a warm and inviting environment for guests. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit yourself to 1 or 2 homemade items and buy the rest. Have enough food for the entire party, and make sure you have options for children and different dietary restrictions (if needed). Don't put out all of your food at once—fill up a few bowls, then refill them as the party needs. [8] X Research source Focus on doing one thing well, and then forgetting the rest. For example, if you spend your cooking time baking a delicious layer cake, don’t worry about also making the entree from scratch. Order take-out or buy something you can warm up in the oven! Put the food options wherever you want people to be: living room, kitchen, or wherever you want guests to flock to!"

      "content": "Having a signature cocktail adds a memorable touch to your party. Choose your favorite cocktail or something connected to the theme (e.g., a gin rickey for a Roaring ‘20s party or an Aperol spritz for an Italian Riviera-themed dinner). In addition to your signature cocktail, serve at least one other kind of alcohol as well as non-alcoholic options like juice or soda. [9] X Research source Serve garnishes and complements like ice, cherries, and lemon slices in small bowls beside the drinks."

      "content": "Give your guests a warm welcome right when they enter the party. Offer to take coats or jackets and direct them to the designated room. Let any guests who haven't been over before know where they can get a drink or some food, and point out the guest bathroom. If you can, take some time to talk and converse. If you're cooking or moving around a lot, lead them into the party, hand them a drink, and excuse yourself with a smile."

Help others mingle by making meaningful introductions between people who haven’t met before, prompting their conversation by sharing something they have in common with each other. [10] X Research source A good way to mix up groups is to ask someone for help with something. You can then steer them to a new group when you're done or make space for someone else to move in. Enlist very shy friends as assistants. Ask them to help keep the food filled with you or prepare a dish for dinner. They'll appreciate the attention. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Party games help loosen people up and stimulate conversation. Choose an activity that best matches your party and your group of guests. Try a drinking game like King’s Cup, a classic board game like Monopoly , or a raunchier card game like Cards Against Humanity . Put a sports game on TV or play a slideshow of photos, giving people something to talk about if the conversation lulls or if they aren’t as involved in the game. Use a pool table or dart board if you have one. Host tasting tests or contests with the appetizers. Set up a karaoke machine with a computer playing sing-along videos. Play Truth or Dare , Never Have I Ever, Desert Island, or similar conversational games."

Everyone may have been hitting the dance floor in the first half of the evening, but now they’re all sitting down and engaging in intimate conversations. Maybe you had an activity planned, like a movie marathon, but people seem much more interested in chatting than watching the film. Let guests lead the way. Avoid constantly trying to make people dance, asking, \"Are you having fun,\" or pushing games on people who just want to talk. Remember that people really just like to be together, so relax and enjoy it!"

Wrap up the conversation by mentioning some highlights from the evening: “I’ll never forget the story Aimee shared about her family parakeet” or “I know Flynn’s party trick will go down in Hanukkah party history.” Then, thank everyone and walk each guest to the door. [12] X Research source Give each guest a small keepsake as you say your goodbye at the door, like a fancy chocolate bar or a Polaroid picture from the evening. Bonus points if your party favor somehow relates to your theme! If someone isn't taking the hint that it's time to leave, try making a light-hearted comment like, \"You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here!\" Reader Poll: We asked 690 wikiHow readers who’ve had to kick someone out, and 54% felt that you should evaluate the situation and the person before using humor to ease the tension.

Leave clean towels in their bedroom so they don’t have to ask. Leave a charger next to their bed, as well as a slip of paper with the WiFi password written on it. [13] X Research source"
