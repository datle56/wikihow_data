      "content": "It’s safe to tuck for 4-8 hours. Tucking comes with a bunch of benefits, including improved body confidence and gender affirmation, though it may not be the most comfortable thing for everyone. However, tucking doesn’t pose a serious medical risk unless you tuck for more than 8 hours–at that point, you increase your risk of complications like UTIs and testicular torsion. [1] X Research source The key is to go slow when you’re first learning to tuck and to stop if you feel faint or experience severe pain or nausea. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Immediate side effects of tucking include chafing and a bit of discomfort. Add baby powder or anti-chafing cream (look for creams sold to runners and cyclists) to the creases of your thighs, buttocks, and genitals to reduce chafing. Shave 1-2 days prior to tucking to reduce irritation if you’re planning on using tape to hold the tuck in place. [3] X Research source Don’t tuck on a day when you shave your pubic area, since your skin will be more sensitive. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "More studies are needed to identify the long-term side effects of tucking. If you tuck frequently, apply antifungal powder when you tuck to reduce your risk of an infection. [5] X Research source Tucking for more than 8 hours may increase your risk of testicular torsion and fertility issues. To prevent long-term damage, don’t tuck if you experience pain, and talk to your doctor about your concerns. [6] X Research source Tucking may affect fertility because tucking the testes into the inguinal canal (where they descended from) exposes the testes to increased body temperature. [7] X Research source Testicular torsion is when the cord that supplies blood to the testicles gets twisted so the blood supply is cut off. This requires emergency surgery.

      "title": "Some discomfort is normal during tucking, especially when you start out.",
      "content": "Some discomfort is normal during tucking, especially when you start out. However, tucking shouldn’t be painful. If you experience pain while tucking the testicles into the inguinal canals, don’t attempt to tuck and tape with that method. Everyone’s body is different, and it’s important to stop when you feel pain or take breaks if you’re experiencing discomfort. [9] X Research source Even if the inguinal canal method isn’t quite right for you, don’t worry–you can use tight shapewear and experiment with alternatives to tucking."

      "title": "Go slowly and tuck for short periods of time on your first few attempts.",
      "content": "Go slowly and tuck for short periods of time on your first few attempts. Wrap the penis in toilet paper or thin cotton. Lie down so you don’t lose your balance. [10] X Research source Use your fingers to push each testicle up into the inguinal canal (where the testicle descended from). Cup your hand firmly over the area to keep everything in place. Tuck the penis and scrotum backward between your legs, and if possible, between your buttocks. [11] X Research source You can use a long strip of tape up the penis and towards your buttocks to keep it in place, or put on tight-fitting underwear. Only use medical or athletic tape to tuck. Steer clear of duct tape. Do not tuck with an erection."

      "title": "Using a gaff or tight underwear is the easiest way to tuck without tape.",
      "content": "Using a gaff or tight underwear is the easiest way to tuck without tape. If you're using a gaff or tight underwear, you can choose whether or not to tuck into the inguinal canals. If you find it too uncomfortable to tuck into the inguinal canals, skip it–tucking is all about making you feel at ease in your body! Instead, just put on a gaff or tight underwear/swimsuit bottoms to flatten the bulge. [12] X Research source A gaff is essentially a tight piece of elastic underwear designed to flatten a penis bulge. Go for tight microfiber blend fabrics or spandex. It’s easier for your genitals to shift if you wear natural fibers like silk or cotton. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Carefully use your fingers to move the penis and testicles back. Untucking isn’t complicated, but it does require a bit of patience and a gentle touch. Remove any tape from the scrotum carefully. The testicles may descend on their own, or you might have to guide them out of the inguinal canals. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "You’ll have to untuck to go to the bathroom. However, it’s crucial that you listen to your body and use the restroom when you feel like you have to. Otherwise, you increase your chances of ending up with a UTI from holding in your urine. [15] X Research source Go to the bathroom before you tuck, and use a non-tape method if you’ll be tucked for a long time. Hydrate normally. It can be tempting to avoid drinking water to reduce your bathroom trips, but that may cause you to become dehydrated."

      "content": "You’ll likely find it easier to tuck if you’ve started hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT tends to shrink the size of testicles to less than 50% of their original size. [16] X Research source When the testicles are smaller, it can make it easier for you to tuck them into the inguinal canals. [17] X Research source"
