      "content": "Scrub off dead skin with an exfoliant. Board-certified podiatrist Catherine Cheung suggests \"using a pumice stone, which is great for self-care maintenance at home.\" Near the end of your shower or bath, gently scrape your feet with a foot file or pumice. You can also do it after your bath if you prefer. If you have a medical condition like neuropathy, nerve issues, or diabetes, Cheung advises \"talking to your doctor or seeing a professional for any foot-related care.\" Another option is to use a liquid foot scrub that is designed to exfoliate. Rub it on in the shower and wash it off. Some people have had good luck with a foot soak of 1 part Listerine, 1 part vinegar, and 2 parts warm water. Soak your feet in it for 20 minutes. However, you'll likely still need to use a physical exfoliant."

To deal with an ingrown toenail yourself, bathe your feet in warm water for about 20 minutes, which can help relieve pain and swelling; acetaminophen and ibuprofen can also help with the pain. Place cotton or dental floss under the edge, to help the nail grow properly; put new pieces back in after each time you soak it. To keep it from getting infected, use antibiotic ointment and then cover the area with a bandage. It can also help if your shoes are loose-fitting or open around the toes. Proper toenail maintenance can help keep you from getting ingrown toenails, such as cutting straight across and keeping toenails at the proper length.
