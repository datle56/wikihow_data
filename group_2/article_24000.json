      "content": "Measure the space on top of your cabinets carefully. Use a measuring tape to calculate the size of the countertops that you want for your kitchen or bathroom. Measure each length from corner to corner and draw a corresponding line with the measurement on a piece of grid paper. Once you’ve sketched out each side with the corresponding measurements labeled, re-measure your cabinets 2-3 times to make sure that your measurements are accurate. Measure the opening of your sink by flipping it over and measuring the base from edge to edge on each side. If your sink is still in the box, it will list the required space for the opening. If you’ve installed the cabinets yourself, make sure that you have a level line running along the top by placing a level over each individual cabinet and measuring the distance from the floor to the top. Use shingles to raise a cabinet if you need to adjust its height to make them level. Add 1 in (2.5 cm) to each side that will lead to a rounded corner if you aren’t ordering countertops with 90-degree corners."

      "content": "Order countertops to fit your cabinets. Order your countertop from a manufacturer that produces laminate countertops. Choose a style and color of laminate that you think will look good in your kitchen or bathroom. Keep in mind that lighter colors will be easier to clean. Give the countertop manufacturer your measurements and wait for them to deliver your countertop. [1] X Research source If you really want to make sure that the countertop fits perfectly, have the distributor take measurements for you. It may cost you a little more, but it’ll ensure that you get a perfect fit. The distributor will determine how many pieces your countertop will come in. Most of the time, it will arrive as a single piece."

Unwrap the packaging and carefully lift it over your cabinets. Set it down slowly and evenly so that you don’t damage your cabinets. Slide it by lifting it a little and repositioning it until it’s in place to ensure that it fits. If it doesn’t fit, measure it and double-check your original measurements to ensure that the manufacturer didn’t make a mistake. If they did, contact them directly to get them to replace it."

Measure the distance from the screw opening of a corner bracket to the edge of the cabinet. This will tell you the distance that you need to install your pilot holes from the cabinets. Once you have the measurement from the screw opening to the side of the bracket, measure and mark the locations of your screws under the cabinet. [3] X Research source Custom-sized counters often come with the pilot holes, brackets, and screws to install it. You can skip the corresponding steps if this is the case. Corner brackets are sometimes called L brackets. They’re L-shaped or triangle-shaped brackets with flat sides and they’re used to attach flat surfaces that are perpendicular."

Use the measurement from your corner bracket to determine how far you need to place each pilot hole from the cabinet. Drill pilot holes where you marked your screws with a carpentry pencil. Use a soft drill bit in the countertop to make the screws fit perfectly. [4] X Research source Place your brackets so that they rest squarely in the corner where your counter meets the cabinets. If your cabinet comes with pre-fitted slots for your screws, you do not need to drill pilot holes. If the brackets weren’t provided, you can purchase them from a local hardware store."

Drill the screw into the countertop first to determine if the bracket will be flush against the cabinet. Repeat this process for each bracket. [5] X Research source Before you drill, hold the bottom of a screw flush against the side of your countertop to make sure that you aren’t going to drill through the countertop completely. For a countertop without screw slots and screws, drill #4 wood screws into your 5 ⁄ 64 inch (0.20 cm) pilot holes."

Place the bottom edge carefully in the corner where the counter meets the wall. Slide it up against the wall and press down towards the corner. When you’re done, use a caulk gun and silicone caulk to fill in the gaps around the edges of your countertops and backsplash. Wait 24 hours before using your countertop to give it time to settle.
