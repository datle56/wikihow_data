      "content": "Start the seeds 8 to 10 weeks before your area’s last frost date. Lavender seeds germinate slowly, often taking at least 1 month to fully sprout. So, start germinating them 8 to 10 weeks before you get warm weather, which is often the last day of frost for your area. This lets you plant the lavender as soon as it sprouts, and gives your lavender plenty of time to grow into mature plants during the warm growing season. [1] X Research source Lavender comes in several different varieties, such as English, Spanish, and French lavender. English lavender tends to be the most popular lavender variety to grow. [2] X Research source The last frost date is the last day in spring when your area typically experiences freezing weather. Search for your area’s last frost date online, or check out this interactive map if you live in the US."

      "content": "Place harvested seeds between damp paper towels in the fridge for 3 weeks. Lavender seeds go through a process called cold stratification, where they stay in cold temperatures to promote germination. If you harvested your own seeds, put them through this process yourself! Just dampen 2 paper towels and drop the seeds in between them. Seal the seeds and paper towels in a plastic bag, then store them in your fridge for about 3 weeks. [3] X Research source Most lavender seeds you buy in seed packs have already gone through cold stratification. Only stratify your seeds if you harvested them yourself from another plant.

Just pour the soil into a multi-cell starter tray, or into a wide, shallow container without divisions. [5] X Research source Lavender seeds germinate the best when they’re kept indoors. While you can sow the seeds directly into your garden, creating a controlled environment inside typically produces more successful sprouts in a shorter amount of time. [6] X Research source"

Then, simply sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil. [7] X Research source If you’re planting the seeds in a multi-cell starter tray, plant one seed per cell. If you’re planting in a division-free container, space the seeds ½ to 1 inch (1-2 cm) apart."

Make sure the soil stays moist by pressing your finger into the potting mix. If it feels dry, give the soil a misting of water. [11] X Research source Growing lavender from seeds can be tricky, so don’t be discouraged if only a few lavender seeds sprout, or none germinate at all.

      "content": "Fill a 4-inch (10 cm) pot with well-draining potting mix . Lavender is a drought-tolerant plant, which means that it doesn’t like to stay in wet soil. Choose a well-draining potting mix that is slightly sandy or gravelly or part soil, part peat, and part perlite. Then, pour the soil into 4-inch (10 cm) pots that have drainage holes. [14] X Research source If you mix your own soil, combine regular, well-draining potting mix with a sandy potting mix for succulents or cactuses in a 1:1 ratio. [15] X Research source Alternatively, use a larger pot or division-free tray and space multiple lavender plants in the tray 2 inches (5 cm) apart from one another. Peat moss is a non-renewable resource, so it's best to use coir dust instead, if possible. Do not use vermiculite, which may contain asbestos, even when the label doesn't say so."

So, place your pots outside in partial shade or partial sun for a few hours at a time, increasing their time outdoors a little each day. Do this for about 1 week, which is long enough for the lavender to adapt to outdoor conditions and direct sunlight.

Chop the soil up with a trowel or a digging fork to loosen it. Then, mix in about 1 inch (2 cm) of compost. Compost has uneven particles, creating looser soil and making it easier for the lavender’s roots to stretch out. The loose soil also helps water to drain faster. [22] X Research source Check the soil pH after adding compost with a pH test strip . Lavender grows best in soils between 6.5 and 7.5 pH. If your soil pH is too low, mix in a handful of agricultural lime . If it is too high, add a small amount of plant litter or pine sawdust . [23] X Research source Plant your lavender on mounds if your area has a damp winter or spring. Create dirt mounds that are about 18 to 24 inches (46-61) tall.

Dig another hole about 24 to 36 inches (61-91 cm) away and set the next plant inside. When you’re done planting, water each lavender plant thoroughly.

[27] X Research source If you want to dry out your lavender , cut off several blooming stems and tie them together in a bunch. Then, hang them upside down in a dark, dry place for about 1 to 2 weeks. When they’re dry, use them in your cooking, make soap, or craft DIY potpourri. To store dried lavender, seal the flowers in dark, plastic containers and place them in a cool, dark, and dry area."

Pruning lavender encourages more flowering, so snip off the top ⅓ of its stems after it finishes producing flowers at the end of the summer. [28] X Research source Lavender grows slowly during the first year, as most of the plant's energy goes toward root and vegetative growth. Your plant might flower slightly in its first year, but by its 2nd or 3rd year of growth, it’ll reach its full blooming potential. [29] X Research source Even if your lavender does not bloom in its first year, still prune back ⅓ of its new growth. This encourages more stem growth and flowers when it blooms next year. [30] X Research source Do not cut into stems that are hard and woody. When you cut into lavender’s woody base, those stems typically don’t grow back."
