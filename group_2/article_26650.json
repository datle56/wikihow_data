      "title": "Remove the hinge pin with a hammer and screwdriver.",
      "content": "Remove the hinge pin with a hammer and screwdriver. The hinge pins are rod-shaped pieces that hold the 2 pieces of the hinge together. Close the door you’re working on so it stays supported while you’re working. Home improvement specialist Gino Colucci recommends “using a center punch, old screwdriver, or something of a similar size. Place the tip against the bottom of the hinge pin in the center. Strike the tool with a hammer to push the pin upward until you can grasp it with your hand.” If your hinge pin is rusted or won’t move, check our guide on removing stuck hinge pins . Some older door hinges don’t have removable hinge pins. If you don’t see a separate pin on your hinge, try our method for lubricating non-removable hinge pins ."

      "content": "Apply lubricant to the hinge pin. After removing the hinge pin, wipe off any old grease and grime using a disposable rag or paper towel. Then, put on a pair of disposable gloves and rub a thin coat of lubricant directly onto the hinge pin.​​ [1] X Research source Put some of the lubricant inside the hinge barrels as well. Just be sure to hold a paper towel or rag underneath the hinge so the lubricant doesn’t drip onto the floor. There are a lot of effective lubricants you can use to fix your hinges, including some common household items you may already own. Check our list of the best lubricants to use on your hinges below."

      "title": "Reassemble the hinge.",
      "content": "Reassemble the hinge. Push the hinge pin back into place and ensure that it is secured. You may have to lift the door up slightly so the hinge barrels line up straight. [2] X Research source If you can’t push the hinge pin in by hand, line the pin up with the hinge and place a piece of scrap wood on top of it. Tap the wood with a hammer so you can get more leverage and avoid damaging the pin."

      "title": "Open and close the door to spread the lubricant.",
      "content": "Open and close the door to spread the lubricant. Swing the door open and closed several times so the lubricant evenly coats the insides of the hinge. As the lube spreads out, the hinge will get quieter and easier to open. [3] X Research source If you still hear squeaking coming from the hinge, take it out and apply more lubricant. If multiple hinges are squeaking or difficult to open, remove each of the remaining pins one at a time. Wipe them off with a clean paper towel or cloth before reapplying the lubricant and pushing them back into place. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a rag or paper towel to clean up any excess lubricant. Wipe away any excess grime, oil drips, and dust from the hinge so it looks clean. Leaving the buildup of grime on the hinge could attract extra dirt and dust, and it may cause the hinge to get squeaky again."

    {
      "title": "Apply lubricant to the outside of the hinge.",
      "content": "Apply lubricant to the outside of the hinge. Lubricant oil or lubricant spray with a narrow nozzle works best for non-removable door hinges because it’s easier to get inside of the hinge. Place a few drops or a few sprays of the lube near the top of the hinge and around the cylindrical barrels. [5] X Research source Start with only a little lubricant at first. You can always use more if you didn’t apply enough the first time. Other lubricants can work on non-removable hinges, though greases may not be as effective because they’re less likely to get inside the hinge. Tip: Set the rag or paper towels on the floor underneath the hinge. Alternatively, hold them directly under the hinge with one hand while you work to prevent any spills."

      "title": "Open and close the door to spread the lube.",
      "content": "Open and close the door to spread the lube. Swing the door back and forth so the lubricant can move down the hinge and pin. When the lube coats the inside of the hinge, it will prevent the pieces from rubbing together and squeaking. [6] X Research source If you still hear squeaking from the hinge, apply a little bit more lubricant to the top of the hinge and continue moving the door. If the other hinges are still squeaking when you open and close the door, move on to the next hinge on your door. Lubricate the hinges one at a time so it’s easier to keep your workspace clean."

      "title": "Silicone spray",
      "content": "Silicone spray Silicone oil spray is considered one of the easiest and best lubricants to use because it applies clean and lasts a long time. The silicone coats the pieces of the hinge so they don’t rub together and create friction when you open and close your door. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Graphite spray Graphite spray is a dry powder that helps reduce friction inside of the hinge so it opens and closes smoothly. Simply spray the graphite powder onto the hinge pin and inside the hinge barrels to lubricate them. [9] X Research source Graphite powder can stain or leave black marks on carpeting, so only use it around hard flooring that’s easier to clean"

      "content": "White lithium grease White lithium grease has a thicker consistency than other lubricant oils, so it tends to last longer on door hinges. Spread the grease in a thin layer over the pin and hinge barrels so they open and close silently. [10] X Research source Lithium grease works well on exterior doors because it’s weather-resistant."

Just dab a little bit of the cooking oil onto a paper towel and rub it onto the hinge pins. [13] X Research source Alternatively, put the oil into a syringe and slowly apply it around the top of the hinge. Cooking oils may attract more dirt and dust than other lubricants, so it’s best to use them in a pinch."

      "content": "Tighten loose screws on the hinges. If the hinges are loose on your wall or door, they may hang crooked and scrape against the pins. Use a screwdriver to tighten all of the hinge screws until they feel secure. Then, open and close your door to check if the squeaking sounds have gone away. [18] X Research source If the screws are loose and won’t tighten, fix the screw holes by filling them with wooden dowels or golf tees."

Then, tap the other end of the pin with your hammer to push the barrel into the proper position. [19] X Research source When you’re finished, reinstall the hinge pin and test the door.

      "content": "Switch to ball-bearing hinges . Ryaan Tuttle, a home improvement specialist, mentions “most doors just have kind of cheap hinges on them and they're rubbing,” which creates a squeaking sound. Ball bearing hinges have small metal bearings inside them so they open more smoothly. Tuttle continues, “ball-bearing hinges will eliminate all the squeaking and rubbing.” When you replace the hinges , make sure you get the same size as the old ones so they easily fit onto the door and wall frame."

If you still can’t find the cause of your door squeaking after fixing or replacing the hinges, then reach out to a general contractor or repair service in your area. Let them know your door is still squeaking or sticking and what you’ve already tried. Squeaking or sticking may be signs of uneven flooring or a warped frame."
