Then, divide that signal into smaller time increments, with each increment forcing the display to update the corresponding digit on the clock. Perform the following steps: Connect the 1 Hz time base of the clocking input (In B, pin 14) to the clocking input of the first 7490. This 7490 is the seconds counter. Wire pin 11 of the first 7490 to the clocking input of the second 7490. This 7490 is the tens of seconds counter. Provide the ability to set the minutes section of the counter. Wire the output from pin 8 of the second 7490 to the normally closed contact of a single pole double throw switch. Wire the normally open contact of the switch to the 1 Hz time base. Wire the wiper of the switch to the clock input of the third 7490. This 7490 is the minutes counter. Wire pin 11 of the third 7490 as the clocking input of the fourth 7490. This 7490 is the tens of minutes counter. Provide the ability to set the hours section of the counter. Wire the output from pin 8 of the fourth 7490 to the normally closed contact of a single pole double throw switch. Wire the normally open contact of the switch to the 1 Hz time base. Wire the wiper of the switch to the clock input of the fifth 7490. The fifth 7490 is the hours counter. Connect pin 6 or pin 7 of the fifth 7490 as the clocking input of the sixth 7490. This 7490 is the tens of hours counter. Use pin 6 of the fifth 7490 for the American 12-hour clock. Use pin 7 of the fifth 7490 for the 24-hour European clock. Attach the 12 volt battery to the 7805 regulator using the 12 volt battery socket."
