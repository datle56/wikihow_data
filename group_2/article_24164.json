Locate the circuit breaker box in your home and turn off the power to the room or area your fan will be installed in. [1] X Expert Source Allen Lee Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 10 July 2020. Some homes will have multiple breaker boxes, with one main and several sub-breaker boxes in different places. If you have multiple breaker boxes, turn off power at the sub-breaker box and the main box before beginning work. If you aren’t sure which fuse corresponds to the room where you’re installing the fan, just flip the main breaker to shut power off to the whole home."

Remove any screws or brackets holding the fan in the ceiling (don’t worry, it won’t fall to the ground). Then, twist the fan out of its bracket and hang the fan from the hook in the ceiling. Disconnect all of the wires before taking the fan down. [2] X Research source Take a photo of the wiring setup before undoing it if you’re worried about connecting the right wires to the new fan. If there is no fitting where you want to install your new ceiling fan, call a licensed electrician to install one for you. You will need to run wiring through your walls, which is very difficult to do and can be very dangerous if done wrong. Lee says you shouldn’t use a step-ladder—use an actual ladder with enough structural support to hold your weight. You’ll also want a ladder with a platform at the top to rest the fan on as you work.

      "content": "Inspect the box to see if you’re able to still use it. The ceiling box is a circular metal fitting that other fixtures attach to. Only a ceiling-rated box will be sturdy enough to hold the weight of your fan. Lee explains that you cannot use the existing ceiling box unless you are absolutely certain it is rated for a ceiling fan. [4] X Expert Source Allen Lee Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 10 July 2020. It should say if it’s rated for ceiling fans on the box itself. If you're unsure or you don’t see a ceiling stamp, contact an electrician—you’ll need them to install the new box anyway. If the ceiling box isn’t up to code, contact an electrician to have them install one. This isn’t a DIY job. The box must be installed by a professional who knows how to ground the box and run the wires correctly."

      "content": "The ceiling plate/bracket is what the fan hangs on. Hold the ceiling plate up to the fan box and pull all of the wires through the hole in its center. Use the provided screws to tightly secure the ceiling plate in place. [5] X Research source If your new fan’s ceiling plate looks identical to the old one, you don’t need to replace it. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions when working with specific parts. The method for attaching ceiling plates and brackets may vary, so consult your manual. If you have a ceiling medallion or any molding to go around the fitting, attach it now. This will be a decorative piece that surrounds the fitting and is secured to the roof. Use a small amount of urethane-based adhesive to hold it to the ceiling, before securing it in place with four finishing nails. For a better-finished appearance, cover the nail holes with caulk or spackle."

Follow your manual’s instructions to connect the base plate, downrod, motor, and switches. [6] X Research source Pro-tip: Install half of your fan blades now. The added weight will make it easy to stabilize the fan on the ceiling as you work and you won’t have to do all of the blades after the fan is attached to the ceiling, which can be a pain to do."

Every fan has a hook or loop on the bracket to suspend the fan just below the ceiling while you connect the wiring. Look on the body of the fan for a small opening that matches the hook and hang your fan on it. [7] X Research source In the extremely rare off-chance your fan’s bracket doesn’t have a hook, ask someone else to hold the fan in place while you work."

Hornof explains that while you should check your instruction manual to confirm which wire connects to what, ceiling fans are generally all the same: white (neutral) goes to white, black (hot) goes to black, and the green/copper wire is for the ground (do this one separately). Connect the wires by holding the exposed copper together and twisting a wire nut over each pair you’re connecting. [8] X Expert Source James Hornof Master Electrician Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. If there’s a blue wire, it’s for a dimmer, dual switch, or light. Connect it to the two black wires. Wiring schemes will vary between different ceiling fans. Check the manufacturer’s guide if your wires differ, or call a licensed electrician."

Find the two ground wires, twist them together and secure with a plastic wire connector. Use electrical tape to keep the wires and the connector in place. If there is no ground wire on the fan, look for a screw attached to bare metal. Connect the ground wire to that screw. Safety warning: If you don’t have a ground screw, or you don’t know how to ground a wire, call a licensed electrician."

Add any shades, aesthetic covers, etc. [11] X Research source Make sure the screws are as tight as you can make them.
