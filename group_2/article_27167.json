Be sure to use unfiltered apple cider vinegar to get all of the benefits. Unfortunately, apple cider vinegar is acidic so you will need to dilute it with some water. Once you have diluted the vinegar, you can use it as a cleaner and toner by dampening a cotton ball with it and wiping your face with the cotton ball. Avoid sensitive areas such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Here are the proportions you will need, based on your skin type: If you have oily skin, use 1 part apple cider vinegar and 1 part water. If you have normal skin, use 1 part apple cider vinegar and 2 parts water. If you have sensitive skin, use 1 part apple cider vinegar and 4 parts water. Be sure to do a patch test on the inside of your elbow before using the vinegar-water mixture on your entire face. If you get an allergic reaction, do not use this face wash."
