      "content": "Hold the card with one hand. Pinch it between your thumb on one side (either the face or back) and your middle and ring fingers (your \"inner fingers\") together on the opposite (either the face or back). [2] X Research source This trick will be much easier to perform with your dominant hand. However, with practice, you may be able to use your non-dominant hand instead. This trick will not work if your audience is on all sides. You need to make sure the back of your hand can be obscured."

      "title": "Grip the long sides of the card with your index finger and pinky (your \"outer fingers\").",
      "content": "Grip the long sides of the card with your index finger and pinky (your \"outer fingers\"). Try to grip the card using only the sides of your fingers as tight as you can. Bend the card into a slight arc that is convex in relation to your fingers. Simultaneously, curl your inner fingers by retracting them behind the card. The sections of your inner fingers between your first and second knuckles should be roughly parallel to the card. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Uncurl your inner fingers to make the card \"disappear.\"",
      "content": "Uncurl your inner fingers to make the card \"disappear.\" Straightening your fingers while maintaining your grip will bring the card to the back of your hand. Show your open palm to your audience, but be sure to keep your ring, middle, and index fingers held close together. [4] X Research source It will take some practice to make it so the edges of the card do not show through at all. Try to only let the card get halfway down the crevices of your fingers."

    {
      "title": "Make the card reappear.",
      "content": "Make the card reappear. Now that your card has \"disappeared,\" you can even more easily appear to conjure it from thin air. Simply curl your middle fingers forward again and pinch it between your thumb and index finger. [5] X Research source Run through these steps as quickly as you can. The faster you move, the more convincing your sleight of hand will be. Once you've gotten the hang of doing this basic trick, try adding movements with your wrists. This will work to misdirect your audience and disguise your moves."

    {
      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. In addition to a playing card, you will need a translucent tumbler-style cup, transparent celluloid, and an opaque handkerchief or a bandana. Bend the card in half and make sure it is well-creased. Using a face card will disguise the crease. Unbend the card before you begin the trick. The cup must be wide enough that an unfolded card can be pushed into it while narrow enough that the card must be forced. The glass must also taper towards the bottom. A tumbler that is highly decorated, such as with designs or ridges, will make the trick easier to pull off but is not absolutely necessary. Cut the celluloid into the exact dimensions of the playing card you are using."

Grip the card with your thumb on the bottom and your index finger at its top, bending it slightly to keep the celluloid in place. Make absolutely sure the celluloid is not visible to your audience."

      "content": "Ask for a volunteer from the audience. Tell your new assistant to call out the name of the card. Request that the volunteer hold the tumbler under the card. You may also ask your assistant to borrow the handkerchief you need. However, this may backfire if the volunteer offers you a translucent one. If the handkerchief is too clear, your audience may see how the trick is performed."

Appear to take hold of the card through the handkerchief with the hand you used to cover the card. In reality, quickly fold the card in half and palm it using the hand that originally held it. Place the card into an easy-to-reach pocket for later. Leave the celluloid in its place under the handkerchief."

Being the exact size of the card, the celluloid will create an outline giving the impression that the card is still there. The cloth barrier will make the celluloid feel indistinguishable from a playing card to your assistant. Ask your assistant to tell the audience if he or she is holding the playing card seen earlier."

      "content": "Produce the card from your pocket. This may be as simple as simply turning out your pockets, as the audience will wonder how it was able to get there. You may also choose to add some dramatic flourishes, misdirecting the audience away from your pocket. While they are focused on one of your hands, use the other to grab the card. Discreetly introduce your card into the \"action\" to make it seem to appear from nowhere."
