      "content": "Build up a repertoire of funny stories. While you don’t want your hilarious anecdotes to feel too staged, it’s a good idea to have a stock collection of amusing stories that you can reference in a pinch. Stick with general topics that are light and fun and try to avoid stories that are gross or intimate unless you know the girl well. Remember -- just because your friends think it’s hilarious doesn’t mean she will! [1] X Research source Think about some amusing stuff that’s happened to you in the past, like the time you wore your shirt inside out for school pictures. If you have a pet, you’ve probably got some hilarious pet stories to share! To keep things fresh, frequent a few funny websites like The Onion and draw from those when you need inspiration."

      "content": "Memorize some quality one-liners. One-liners are not the tools to reach for when you want to show off your sharp wit, but they can be great when you want to be silly . The cornier, the better! You can make them about her or go with something more general. Avoid awkward one-liners that are sexual in nature though. Contrary to popular belief, girls don’t find those very funny -- you might even make her uncomfortable. A few examples of fun one-liners you can try: [2] X Research source “Did you tie my shoelaces together? Because you got me trippin’ over you, girl!” “You have something beautiful on your face. Oh wait, that’s just you.” “A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing!” Reader Poll: We asked 158 wikiHow readers if they think humor is effective for starting a conversation with a girl, and 81% of them said yes.

If you’re great at physical humor, go with that. If you're a master of mimicry and impersonations, give those a try. If sassy comebacks are your thing, try a few of those in her presence.

      "content": "Learn to laugh at yourself. Don’t go off the deep end with self-deprecation, but targeting some silly things about yourself may crack her up. Draw from your personal experiences or learn to poke fun at yourself in the moment. For example, if you trip over something when you’re walking with her, you could say, “Well, there goes my dream of becoming a runway model!” This lightens the mood and also shows her that you’re laidback and comfortable with yourself. [4] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Try not to rely on this tactic too heavily, since it can get awkward or just plain unfunny after a while. However, an occasional, well-placed joke at your own expense can be priceless. Expect your humor to fall flat on occasion. In these cases, use the bad joke to make another and get the conversation going again."

      "content": "Make funny comments based on past conversations or situations with her. This can be something as simple as, “Remember that time in history class when…” and then filling in the blank with a good anecdote. Or try to make a funny comment based on something she’s told you before – not only will she laugh, but she’ll probably be flattered that you remembered that detail. [5] X Research source For example, if she told you she loves fashion, ask for her professional fashion advice and describe a terrible or ridiculous outfit you’re planning to wear to an upcoming event."

When you do, save the image and send it to her via text. You won’t be able to hear her laugh, but you’ll probably get an all-caps “LOL” out of it! If you know she likes something in particular, look for memes on that specific topic. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

Or you can go with something simpler, like a collection of animal bloopers or a scene from her favorite comedy television show. [7] X Research source For example, if you know she loves the TV show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , you can definitely find some amusing clips to send to make her smile. Try to avoid sending these to her constantly, but every once in a while a funny video will no doubt crack her up."

      "content": "Take a silly picture of yourself and slap a funny Snapchat filter over it. This isn’t exactly a fresh tactic, but it can still be pretty hilarious! There are tons of filters to choose from, so go through and experiment with a couple. If you find yourself doubled over in laughter after creating one, it’s highly likely that she’ll also think it’s funny. [8] X Research source She may even reciprocate with one of her own to keep the joke going! You could also send her funny photos of yourself, like baby photos."

For example, if one of you knocks over a drink at a restaurant, that’s a great time to make a silly joke – it’ll lighten the mood. If she’s upset about something going on in her life, though, tread carefully. [9] X Research source If her pet just died or she failed a math test, trying to cheer her up with witty one-liners may fall flat or possibly upset her more. If you're going through something or just not feeling particularly funny that day, don't try to force it."

      "content": "Try to get a feel for what she finds funny and work with that. Every girl is different, so try to adapt to her personality to make her laugh . Ask her simple questions to gather the intel you need. For example, you could say something like, “Did you watch Stephen Colbert last night?” If she says yes, she probably likes political satire! If she brings up a certain movie or television show, work with that type of humor. For example, if she mentions Portlandia or an episode of SNL, that gives you an idea of what she likes."

      "content": "Keep the tone light. Some girls love dark humor and sarcastic comebacks, so if you are certain she’s into that, go for it! In general, though, it’s better for everyone if you keep things light and fun. Being sarcastic or cynical right off the bat might come off as aggressive or weird. If you’re dropping gallows humor nonstop, she might eventually get tired of that vibe or feel that it’s just a bummer in general. [10] X Research source Definitely avoid making sarcastic remarks aimed at her, especially if you don’t know her well."

      "content": "Laugh with her and not at her. Laughter is infectious and enjoying a humorous situation together can help cement your bond or make her more attracted to you. However, make sure you're not laughing at her expense. If you're laughing and having a good time, you want her to be doing the same. Mimicking her sense of humor is one way to laugh with her. If it's risqué, for example, use off-color humor, too. Keep it natural if you can: if your humor is naturally sunny and gentle, adopting a dark, sarcastic style could come across as forced. Only follow her lead once you're sure of her style of humor. Forgive nervous silliness on her behalf if she seems unsure of how to react. Ask about her favorite comedians , funny movies, or sitcoms. Watch or reference them when you are together to help stimulate a relaxed and funny atmosphere."

Everyone likes to laugh and have fun, but sometimes people want to have a serious conversation or share something intimate with you. If you’re cracking jokes 100% of the time, she may not take you seriously, or feel that she can’t share anything intimate with you because you’ll use it as joke fodder. Be sure to switch things up occasionally so she sees you as a multi-dimensional person. [11] X Research source"
