      "content": "Give a toast that grabs everyone’s attention. If you aren’t used to giving toasts, the idea of speaking in front of a group of people might seem a little scary. One way to overcome your stage fright is to take a deep breath and know what you’re going to say. “If you're not someone that speaks off the cuff…don't go that route. Have something…planned out,” recommends Summer. Or, try memorizing a toast—like the ones below—you can use the next time you’re ready to raise a glass: We drink to your coffin. May it be built from the wood of a hundred-year-old oak tree that I shall plant tomorrow. Cheerfulness, content, and competency. Cheerfulness in our cups, Content in our minds, Competency in our pockets. Here’s to the fire in our hearts and the sparks in our eyes. May you live to be a hundred years old with one extra year to repent. Here’s to those who inspire us and don’t even know it. I wish thee health, I wish thee wealth, I wish thee gold in store, I wish thee heaven upon earth—What could I wish thee more? Here’s to the future, for it is bright. May we live to learn well and learn to live well. Here’s to doing what we love and loving what we do. May the works of our nights never fear the daylight. May your pockets be heavy and your heart be light. Here’s hoping you live forever. And mine is the last voice you hear. May our faults be written on the seashore, and every good action becomes a wave to wash them out. May your heart be light and happy. May your smile be big and wide. And may your pockets always have a coin or two inside."

[1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source So, if you feel confident being funny in front of a crowd, go for it! It also helps to have some funny material to work with. Here are a few chuckle-worthy toasts to get you started: May we all be the people our dogs think we are. To the holidays—all 365 of them. May you never forget what is worth remembering or remember what is best forgotten. Another day, another bender. No retreat, no surrender. Champagne for my real friends and real pain for my sham friends. Here's to the man who is wisest and best. Here's to the man who, with judgment, is blessed. Here's to the man who's as smart as can be. I drink to the man who agrees with me! Here’s to alcohol, which often makes one see double and feel single. May our children be blessed with rich parents! Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter. Sermons and soda water the day after. To your very good health. May you live to be as old as your jokes. May we get what we want, but never what we deserve. May we all have the chance to prove that money can’t make us happy. Here’s to alcohol, the rose-colored glasses of life.

      "content": "Get a little risqué with an off-color toast. If you’re making a toast in a group of adults, you may want to try a little blue humor, or humor that is lewd or sexually suggestive. [2] X Research source Just make sure you know the sense of humor of the people in the gathering, so you don’t risk offending someone…especially the person you’re toasting. If you’re ready to add a little ribaldry to your toast, try one of these: Here’s to those who wish us well. All the rest can go to hell. Here’s to the women who have used and abused us…may they never stop! May we never go to hell but always be on our way. Here’s to being single, drinking doubles, and seeing triple. May all your ups and downs be under the covers! Here’s to women, beer, and song. May none of them be flat. Here’s to you. You may not be as wise as an owl, but you’re always a hoot! Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker. May we never sleep with anyone crazier than ourselves. Here’s to it, and from it, and to it again, and if you don’t do it when you get to it, you may never get to it to do it again! Here’s to dancing—a vertical expression of horizontal intention. To Hell. May the stay there be as enjoyable as the way there. Here’s to staying positive and testing negative!"

[3] X Research source People at a gathering want to chat, have a drink, and relax, not listen to a never-ending toast. But they’re probably not going to be upset with a short toast like the ones below: May poverty always be a day’s march away. To the good times! May we live respected and die regretted. Cheers to the memories! Live long enough to be a problem to your children. May we never regret this. While we live, let us live. To the best in life! Love, life, and liberty. Love pure, Life long, Liberty boundless. To good times and great friends! May we be happy, and our enemies know it. Cheers to happiness! Take everything in moderation, including moderation. May our glasses be ever full. To the road that lies ahead. May the most you wish for be the least you get."

Still, that’s no excuse to give up on toasting entirely! Try one of these brief yet effective one-word toasts in a variety of languages to pay tribute in a simple way: Cheers! – English toast. ¡Salud! – Spanish for “to your health.” Prost! – German for “cheers.” 乾杯!

May the warmth of our affections survive the frosts of age. May you be poor in misfortune, rich in blessings, slow to make enemies, and quick to make friends! May the friends of our youth be the companions of our old age. May the roof above us never fall in. And may we friends gathered below never fall out. Friendship: May differences of opinion cement it. Here’s to the nights we’ll never remember with our friends, we’ll never forget. To friends: as long as we are able to lift our glasses from the table. Some ships are wooden ships, but those ships may sink. The best ships are friendships, and to those ships, we drink. Here's to those who've seen us at our best and seen us at our worst and can't tell the difference. May your home always be too small to hold all your friends."

If you’re responsible for giving a toast at the wedding reception or asked to speak at their engagement party, it might be tempting to surprise the couple with your comments.

      "content": "Stand up and raise your glass to get everyone’s attention. People often give toasts at parties or events that might be loud. When you want to give a toast , you have to get everyone’s attention. The best way to signal you’re about to toast, stand up and raise your glass to about shoulder height. This usually gets at least a few people’s attention, and they will start alerting others. [5] X Research source Do not clang silverware against your glass. Not only is it a little rude, but it’s also possible you’ll break the glass. If standing doesn’t get their attention, say something like, “Can I please have your attention?” in a loud voice."

It’s possible there are people in the room who don’t know who you are, especially at larger events like weddings. Introduce yourself with your name and how you’re connected to the host. Then, tell a short story that is connected to the event in some way. Don’t worry about being funny. It’s better to be sincere. [6] X Research source For example, you might say something like: “I’m Sara Gilliam, and I’m the maid of honor and the bride’s sister. When Mom was pregnant with Emily, I used to practice holding my baby dolls so I would be ready to hold her when she was finally born. I was just so excited to have a sister. I’m still just as excited to have a sister today…and with a bonus brother-in-law!” “My name is Gerald Smith, and I’ve worked alongside Russ for over 10 years. On my first day at Arlington, Inc., I was just a wide-eyed kid who had no idea what I was doing. Russ noticed right away and took me under his wing, showing me how to do my job with kindness and patience. He’s shown me, and everyone else on the team, that same patience and kindness to this day, his retirement day…when he showed me how to work the new copier.”"

If they choose not to, you can propose a toast to them for hosting. Only the person making the toast stands unless they ask everyone to stand in their toast. At the end of the toast, everyone except the person being toasted raises their glass and drinks. Don’t clink your glasses together. The person being toasted should acknowledge the toast with a smile or nod. Alcoholic drinks aren’t required, and you only need to take a sip of your drink."
