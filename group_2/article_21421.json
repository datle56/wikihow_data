      "content": "Grow your facial hair for at least 4 weeks. Your facial hair will need to be about an inch long to sport full sideburns. If you want bushier sideburns, then you may need to grow your hair even longer. Everyone's facial hair grows at a different pace, so it may take longer for yours to grow to the right length for sideburns. Try growing your hair into a beard first to get the length and then you can shave the facial hair into sideburns later. If you just want short, stubble length sideburns, then you might be able to get these within a few days to a week. Grow your facial hair until it reaches the length that you desire. Keep in mind that if you are young, such as in your teens or twenties, then it might take even longer to grow your facial hair. Try to be patient while you wait."

      "content": "Shave the hair into sideburns when you have enough hair. Sideburns are distinct strips of facial hair at the sides of your facial hair that connect to the hair on your head. When your facial hair has reached the length that you desire, you can shave off the hair on your chin and off most of your cheeks to create the sideburns. To get sideburns, shave the hair off of your chin and off of the lower part of your cheek. Then, shave around the hair that extends from the area just about your ear to create a strip. You can make this strip as thin or as thick as you like. Some people even create designs with their sideburns, but this is more advanced, so you might need to see a barber if you're interested. When you are finished, you should just have strips on both sides of your face that extend from the hair above your ear to about the middle of your cheek."

Are you looking for bushy sideburns, or something modern and trimmed? Are you looking for a straight, or tapered bottom? If you have a model in mind, take a precision trimmer and cut it around in the likeness of your example. You can even cater the look of your sideburns to the shape of your own face. For long and thinner faces, bushier, jawline sideburns will help soften the angles of your face shape. Rounder faces may benefit more from shorter sideburns."
