      "title": "Find a picture of the famous person.",
      "content": "Find a picture of the famous person. You'll need an image into which you can insert your own picture, so find and download a picture of the person with whom you want to make a photo. Ideally, you'll find a photo that leaves plenty of room for you to insert your own photo. Try to find an obscure, lesser-known photo of the famous person, as using a common photo will make it easier for people to identify the photo as fake. Using a photo in which the person is on level ground with natural lighting will help make your final result more convincing."

      "title": "Find or take a picture of yourself.",
      "content": "Find or take a picture of yourself. Once you've found your celebrity photo, you'll need to find a decent photo of yourself to use. You can also take a photo of yourself if you'd prefer not to use an existing photo. Take into account the conditions of the celebrity's photo when finding a picture of yourself. For example, if it's raining in the celebrity's photo, you probably shouldn't use an image of yourself in sunbathing attire. You'll want to make sure the photo of yourself comes close to matching the overall lighting conditions and resolution of the celebrity's photo. Nothing can flag your photo as fake faster than using a high-quality photo of the celebrity and a low-quality video of yourself."
