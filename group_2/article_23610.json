      "content": "Know the parts of speech. These are the types of words that make up the language, and they are nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections, and sometimes articles. [1] X Research source To put sentences together properly, you must understand what the parts of speech are and how they function in sentences. Nouns are the elements that usually perform the action in a sentence, such as a person, place, thing, idea, emotion, animal, or event. Nouns include Sally , Paris , sand , philosophy , happiness , dog , and birthday . Adjectives modify nouns and describe aspects or characteristics of nouns. Adjectives include red , funny , lazy , large , and short . Pronouns take the place of nouns. There are personal subject pronouns (such as I , she , and they ), personal object pronouns (such as us , you , it , and them ), personal possessive pronouns (such as mine , yours , his , hers , and theirs ), and relative pronouns (such as who , which , that , and whose ). Verbs indicate actions or states of being and tell what the noun is doing. Verbs include run , sing , type , be , and walk . Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, prepositions, and other adverbs. They are words like quickly , well , and slowly . These words often end in –ly. Prepositions indicate relationships in time, space, or direction. Prepositions include to , in , on , over , of , and across . Conjunctions join nouns, clauses, phrases, and sentences. Coordinating conjunctions link independent clauses, and they are for , and , nor , but , or , yet , and so (remember FANBOYS). Subordinating conjunctions link dependent clauses, and they include because , if , since , while , and although . Interjections are words that indicate emotions. These include oh , hey , ouch , and wow . They are often followed by exclamation points. Articles are used to modify and define nouns. The is a definite article, and a and an are the indefinite articles."

      "content": "Use proper word order. English sentences are structured following the subject–verb–object order (such as “Andrea ran to the door,” not “Run to the door Andrea”). In general, articles come before adjectives, and adjectives come before the nouns they modify. Modifiers should always be placed as close to their nouns as possible. For instance: [3] X Research source Frank (subject) quickly (adverb) mailed (verb) the (article) long (adjective) letter (object)."

      "title": "Conjugate verbs properly.",
      "content": "Conjugate verbs properly. English technically only conjugates the present (“I like”) and past tenses (“I liked”), meaning that English verbs are only inflected (have different forms or endings) for these tenses. However, other verb tenses, such as the future (“I will like”), are created with the help of mood, words that denote time (such as “tomorrow”), and auxiliary (helping) words and verbs. Using the verb “to go” as an example, some of the main tenses in English are: [4] X Research source Simple present (uninflected verb, or verb + s/es in third person): I go, you go, he/she/it goes, we go, you go, they go. Present continuous (aka progressive) (am/is/are + present participle): I am going, you are going, he/she/it is going, we/you/they are going. Present perfect (has/have + past participle): I have gone, you have gone, he/she/it has gone, we/you/they have gone. Simple past (verb + –ed for regular verbs): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they went (“to go” is an irregular verb). Past continuous (was/were + present participle): I was going, you were going, he/she/it was going, we/you/they were going. Past Perfect (had + past participle): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they had gone. Simple future (will + uninflected verb): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they will go. Future continuous (will be + present participle): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they will be going. Future Perfect (will have + past participle): I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they will have gone."

      "title": "Punctuate sentences properly.",
      "content": "Punctuate sentences properly. Punctuation is an important part of language because it indicates starts, stops, pauses, and relationships. Capitalize the first letter of every sentence, and the first letter of all proper nouns (the names of people and places). The main punctuation marks in English—and their basic uses—are: [5] X Research source Commas separate thoughts, ideas, elements, and independent clauses. Periods indicate the end of a sentence. Semicolons join independent clauses in a single sentence or separate elements in a list. Colons introduce items in a list, explanations, or definitions. Question marks indicate that a question was posed. Exclamation points show emphasis, imperatives, or declarations. Apostrophes demonstrate possession or create contractions. Quotation marks indicate that you are directly quoting someone else’s words. Hyphens join separate words into compound words, modifiers, and numbers. Dashes create a pause, interrupt a sentence, or add parenthetical information. Parenthesis add additional information, references, or citations."

      "content": "Learn the difference between confusing words. English has a lot of words that look, sound, and/or are spelled the same, even if they have very different meanings. These homographs (words that are spelled the same), homophones (words that are pronounced the same), heteronyms (words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently), and homonyms (words that are spelled and pronounced the same) cause a great deal of confusion, and result in common errors. Remembering these common errors will help you avoid frequently made mistakes. [10] X Research source Common mistakes include: Confusing it’s (a contraction of it is ) and its (a possessive pronoun). Mixing up they’re (a contraction of they are ), their (a possessive pronoun), and there (an adverb indicating place). Using you’re (a contraction of you are ) and your (a possessive pronoun) incorrectly. Confusing too (which means in addition), to (a preposition) and two (the cardinal number that comes after one). Not using then (meaning at that time ) and than (used to compare) correctly. Improperly using lie (meaning to be in a horizontal position) and lay (which means to place something in a horizontal position). Confusing farther (used with physical distance) and further (used with figurative or metaphorical distance)."

      "title": "Use punctuation properly.",
      "content": "Use punctuation properly. Improper punctuation can mean that the meaning you’re trying to convey can be confused or lost. There are many punctuation-related errors that can occur in English, including: Run-on sentences, where there is no punctuation separating independent clauses in the same sentence. This can be remedied by either placing a semicolon or period between the independent clauses. Comma splices, where independent clauses in a sentence are joined with a comma but without a proper coordinating conjunction. Instead of using just a comma, use a comma followed by the word “and” or “but.” Using apostrophes to create plurals (they are used to create contractions or show possession, not create plurals). Improper use of quotation marks, which should only be used to indicate that you are directly quoting something someone said."

      "title": "Use the active voice.",
      "content": "Use the active voice. In an active construction, the subject is the thing that performs the action; in a passive construction, the subject is acted upon by an outside force. While there’s nothing wrong with the passive voice, it’s less forceful and can make sentences unclear. Therefore, you should use the active voice more often, but it’s acceptable to use the passive voice from time to time, especially to emphasize something. For example, consider how these active and passive sentences place emphasis on different elements of the sentence: [11] X Research source The active “I paid the bill” places the emphasis on what the subject did. The passive “The bill was paid by me” places the emphasis on who paid the bill."

      "content": "Use reflexive pronouns properly. The reflexive pronouns are myself, yourself, himself/herself/itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves. These pronouns can be used reflexively or intensively. Reflexive pronouns are only used as the object in a sentence, and only when that object is the same as the subject. Intensive pronouns are used to add emphasis to a sentence and reinforces that the subject performed the action. To tell the difference, remember that if the pronoun can be removed from the sentence and it still makes sense, the pronoun is being used intensively. However, if the pronoun cannot be removed without altering the meaning of the sentence, it’s being used reflexively. [12] X Research source Reflexive: “I pinched myself to see if I was dreaming.” Intensive: “She individually picked each gift herself.” Reflexive: “He asked himself how he’d feel in that situation.” Intensive: “I myself don’t know how I’d react.”"

      "content": "Read style guides and grammar books. Grammar and style guides come in two forms: descriptive guides that describe how people do speak, and prescriptive guides that tell people how they should speak. But language changes and evolves, and the rules of English aren’t always set in stone. There are many style guides that recommend different ways of approaching grammar, and it’s a good idea to read several of them. This will provide an idea of the different ways to approach spelling (such as American versus British), syntax, and style, give you a better idea of the fundamentals of grammar, and show you where the language is adaptable and where it’s inflexible. Some of the most widely used style guides are: The Chicago Manual of Style, which is often used for social science and historical journals. The Modern Language Association (MLA) style, which is often used in the humanities, in language studies, and in cultural studies. The Associated Press (AP) style, which is used by most news and media outlets. The American Psychological Association (APA) style, which is often used for natural and life sciences, academic journals, and social sciences."
