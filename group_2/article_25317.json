      "content": "YouTube allows creators to \"hide\" other users. Currently, there's no block feature that fully stops another person from following or interacting with another channel. Similarly, there is no feature that blocks a specific channel from appearing on a user's feed. When someone chooses to hide a user from their channel, this means that all previous comments left on the channel's video will be hidden within 48 hours. This essentially means the user is shadowbanned, and all interactions with the channel and videos won't be visible. Hidden users also cannot create clips from your videos or live streams. [1] X Research source If you're hidden by a channel user, you can still do everything normally, such as watch videos and subscribe, but all of your interactions will be hidden until the channel user chooses to \"show\" you again."
