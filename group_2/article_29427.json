    {
      "title": "Decide on the size of your igloo.",
      "content": "Decide on the size of your igloo. You’ll want to determine the final size of your igloo before you start building. If this is for a class project, make sure to read your instructions carefully in case your teacher wants a certain size igloo. Otherwise, consider how much time or how many materials you are willing to use to build."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a building platform.",
      "content": "Find a building platform. It is important that you build your igloo on a firm foundation, otherwise it may shift around and break, especially if you’ll need to move it. Make sure to consider the weight of the final igloo as well. For a lighter igloo, such as one built from marshmallows, a foam board may be sufficient. For a heavier igloo, you may need a light wooden board. If you want to change the color of your platform, it is easier to do so before you start building. Go ahead and use markers or paint to create a snowy, white setting to build upon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline your foundation.",
      "content": "Outline your foundation. Take a marker or pen and lightly outline the base of your igloo. You will want it to be roughly circular. To get that perfect circle, it might help to trace around the base of a large bowl or perhaps a half-circle of Styrofoam. Make sure that you are happy with the size of your foundation as it will also set the final size of your igloo. [1] X Research source You can also cut a Styrofoam ball in half and then hot glue it onto your base. This will allow you to then build on top of the Styrofoam, guaranteeing an even, circular-shaped igloo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Re-adjust as you build.",
      "content": "Re-adjust as you build. Plans can always go a bit awry. If you start to build your igloo and it is not turning out as you’d like, then stop and reassess the situation. You may need to place an entire extra layer of building materials on top of your partially constructed dome. You may need to tear it down to the foundation and start over."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t expect perfection.",
      "content": "Don’t expect perfection. As you add layers onto your igloo, you will notice that more cracks and spaces will become visible. This is perfectly normal. You can try to fill these gaps with mortar, but you may end up creating a messy look. Instead, it is better to keep tightening your structure with each layer, realizing that it won’t be absolutely gap-free."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add any extra decorations.",
      "content": "Add any extra decorations. Sprinkle powdered sugar or white glitter over the entire finished product. Add battery-powered lights on top of, around, or even inside your igloo. Place small figures inside or around your igloo. [2] X Research source You can even build a series of smaller igloos around your main one, creating an igloo village."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create your mortar.",
      "content": "Create your mortar. Mix two egg whites and three cups of powder sugar together in a medium bowl. Keep stirring until the mixture takes on a glue-like consistency. Make sure that you’ve stirred away all of the major lumps. Set your mortar aside. While a sugar cube igloo might sound tasty, avoid eating it. The raw egg whites could make you sick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay out your cube base.",
      "content": "Lay out your cube base. Place a single row of sugar cubes on top of the circle you’ve drawn for your foundation. Try to make it so that the cubes are angled in the same direction slightly inward. Once you are happy with the placement of the cubes, secure each of them to the platform with mortar. [3] X Research source Be aware that you can also use a hot glue gun to connect the cubes to the platform and to one another. However, you’ll want to be very careful or you could accidentally melt the cubes in the process. If you are building on top of a Styrofoam ball, it is possible to reverse this process and build from the top down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep adding layers.",
      "content": "Keep adding layers. Add another layer of sugar cubes on top of the first one and continue on. You will also want to gradually decrease the circumference of the layer circles. For a smaller igloo, five or so layers may be sufficient. Keep going until the igloo is closed at the top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let it dry completely.",
      "content": "Let it dry completely. Since you used a liquid mixture to attach the cubes, you’ll want to leave your igloo alone for a number of hours in order to let it fully dry out. Then, if you move it, be careful not to jolt it too much or pieces might break away. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Build a Lego igloo.",
      "content": "Build a Lego igloo. Get a bunch of white, rectangular Lego blocks. They can be whatever size you choose. Build your igloo on top of a corresponding white Lego mat. Create a circle base and then gradually move the cubes inward until you have a dome. No adhesive is necessary unless you are worried about stability."

      "title": "Build an ice cube igloo.",
      "content": "Build an ice cube igloo. Freeze an assortment of ice cubes from full-size to quarter-size in an ice tray. Remove the cubes and position them in a circle on your platform. Use a combination of salt and water to make the cubes adhere to one another as you build upwards. Periodically freeze the entire structure for added stability. When the structure is completed, coat it with a thin layer of a salt-water mixture. Re-freeze. [5] X Research source Salt will bring the freezing point of the down below 32 °F (0 °C). Thus, it partially melts the cubes together. Then, by placing them in the freezer, they will freeze together again as the temperature drops below the new freezing point."

      "content": "Build a milk jug igloo. Collect a number of clean, plastic milk jugs. Using a hot glue gun, attach the jugs by the handles on top of the circle that you’ve drawn as your foundation. Then, continue to stagger the jugs as you make your way towards the top of your dome. You can also cut the jugs and place them together like puzzle-pieces for added stability. [6] X Research source It isn’t necessary to throw the milk caps away. You can use them as decorations either on top of your dome or around it."

      "title": "Build a marshmallow igloo.",
      "content": "Build a marshmallow igloo. Get a bag of mini, regular, or jumbo-sized marshmallows. Start building up from the base by creating a marshmallow ring. Connect the marshmallows using frosting or cold glue. If you use frosting, it is a good idea to freeze your final creation for added stability. You can also insert toothpicks at various points in the structure to serve as an added framework. [7] X Research source If you want your igloo to be edible, stick with marshmallows, icing, and straight pretzel sticks for support."

      "title": "Build a large foam or cardboard igloo.",
      "content": "Build a large foam or cardboard igloo. To create this type of igloo, you will want to cut out rectangular “blocks” beforehand. Make sure that the blocks are relatively uniform in shape and size. You may want a number of smaller blocks to use around the door area. Build up the igloo by layering the blocks on top of one another and connecting them using hot glue or heavy tape. [8] X Research source"
