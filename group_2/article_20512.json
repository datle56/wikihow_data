      "content": "Sagittariuses tend to feel stifled when people are too clingy. Although it might be the last thing you want to do right now, give your Sag some time to herself to make her miss you. “Sagittariuses want somebody who gives them space,” explains Eyedealism, so if you show that you can respect her boundaries, this may actually make her feel safe enough to come closer again when she’s ready. [1] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. She needs to know that you can make it on your own, so go out and live your own life full of adventure, and don’t go crawling back to her right away—this might make her stick with her initial decision. Hang out with friends, dive into your career, or go on a solo road trip. You don’t have to give her space forever, but it’s a good idea to wait until she reaches out to you first, if you can. “If you trust your Sagittarius enough to give her space, she will come closer. If you try to control or micromanage her in any way, she won't be able to tolerate it,” Eyedealism says.

      "content": "This optimistic sign gets uncomfortable with super negative emotions. Sagittariuses are known for their endless positivity, and they prefer to stick to the bright side of life. So, although it might feel like your world is ending, try to avoid showing up on her doorstep crying, or making a long post on social media begging for her back. Even though your feelings may be sincere, this show of intense emotion may make her feel overwhelmed, which could cause her to keep her distance. If you feel the need to talk through your emotions about the break-up, approach a trusted friend or family member for support, instead. The more you act like you’re okay and show that you’re still living a fun, exciting life, the more likely she is to be intrigued and reach out again."

      "content": "Sagittarius women are quick to give people second chances. Since this sign is so optimistic, they naturally see the best in people, and they forgive pretty easily. [3] X Research source If you know you hurt her feelings or made her angry, a sincere, direct apology can go a long way! She might hold onto her anger for a little while longer, but eventually, she’ll probably be eager to move on and see you in a positive light again. You might say something like, “I’m so sorry that I didn’t make enough time for you in our relationship. It wasn’t right, and I can understand why it made you upset.” The key here is only to apologize if you truly mean it. Sagittariuses are like lie detectors: if you’re not telling the truth, they’re going to know. Reader Poll: We asked 546 wikiHow readers about the best way to apologize to a girl who’s really mad at you, and only 5% of them recommended taking her out to her favorite restaurant or activity . [Take Poll] Offering a genuine apology might be a better tactic."

      "content": "She can spot a lie from a mile away. If you’re trying to win her back, don’t sugarcoat your words, make promises you can’t keep, or make up untrue excuses about things you did wrong in the relationship. According to Eyedealism, Sagittariuses are “seeking truth and justice throughout the world,” so lying is one of the worst things you can do in their eyes. [4] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Approach her with directness and honesty, and she’s more likely to forgive you and give you another chance. Even if it’s something that might not be super easy for her to hear, she’ll still appreciate your honesty more than anything. For example, say something like, “I know I messed up by missing your big performance. I’m so sorry, and I completely understand why it upset you.” This would land much better with a Sagittarius than a lie or excuse, like, “I did miss your show, but it was because my car broke down while I was on my way there. I would have made it if it wasn’t for that.”"

      "content": "Your fiery Sag woman might have a few choice words for you. If your breakup was a little messy, you may have to endure a few insulting words. Sagittariuses care deeply about justice and they aren’t afraid to stand up for themselves, so she’ll probably want to say her piece if you betrayed her or wronged her in some way. And, as their symbol of The Archer suggests, a Sagittarius’s words can definitely shoot to kill sometimes. [5] X Research source Try to power through, and remember that this is her way of processing her emotions and working through what happened. The nice thing about Sagittariuses, though, is that once they work through things, they usually don’t hold a grudge. They have quick tempers, but they forgive just as quickly. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Sprinkle in a few comments here and there about how amazing she is. Sagittarius women tend to be pretty bold and confident, so she won’t need to hear things like this all the time. [7] X Research source It’s important to remember, however, that even Sagittarius women aren’t immune to a little flattery every now and then. Try telling her how much she means to you or how happy you are that she’s in your life. If you’re honest and genuine with your compliments , she’ll likely really appreciate them! Try things like: “I’m really glad we reconnected. I would’ve been really sad if I never got to see you again.” “I’m so happy that you’re in my life. You’re an amazing person to be around.” “I love how you live your life with so much passion and optimism. It’s so cool to see.” Just be careful not to overdo it—Sag women aren’t the mushiest people, so they won’t like anything too emotional. If you try to write her “a card about how much you love her,” or something like that, you run the risk of “totally grossing her out,” says Eyedealism.

      "content": "This sign deeply values friendship. In fact, Sagittariuses often start out as friends with their romantic partners, so chances are this is how the two of you connected in the first place. [9] X Research source When you start hanging out again, don’t try to immediately jump back into a relationship. Instead, treat her like you’d treat a really good friend: be there for her, listen to her, and spend a lot of time with her. She’ll appreciate that you aren't trying to rush anything, and romance can blossom again from there. There’s no set timeline for how long you might just have to focus on friendship, but expect to spend a few weeks (or even months) being her friend before she considers a relationship with you again."

      "content": "Sagittariuses can be a little hesitant to talk about deep feelings. They prefer to stay in the philosophical, intellectual realm in conversations, and they like to stick to optimistic topics, rather than heavy or negative emotions. If you try to rope a Sag woman into a conversation about her inner feelings, you might just send her running for the hills. Instead, talk about casual, fun things, like what you’re doing that weekend, or how your job is going. She’ll appreciate that you aren’t trying to trap her into a heavy conversation, and that you’re letting her take the lead when it comes to the more serious topics. When she’s ready to open up about the break-up, she’ll likely let you know. For instance, you might text her something like, “Just went frisbee golfing for the first time! It was really fun, I think you’d like it.” Or, “Did you get into anything fun this weekend?” These lighthearted texts will likely land better than something like, “Please just talk to me about what went wrong. I can’t handle losing you,” or other intense messages like that. She’ll probably want to keep things casual, at least at first."

If you’re reconnecting with a Sag woman, the typical coffee meet-up or dinner date might not be the best ideas. “Sagittarius women love adventure and excitement…They love movement, they love action” Eyedealism explains. She suggests planning outdoor activities or taking her to a concert for a band she loves. “Sagittariuses are the rock stars of the zodiac. They’re very fiery and dynamic, so they want that in a partner,” she says. [10] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. For example, invite her on a day trip to explore a cool town, or suggest an exciting activity , like a silent disco or an evening at a theme park. When in doubt, anything outdoorsy and active is sure to appeal to a Sagittarius, too. Picnicking on the beach , hiking, roller-skating, biking, or skiing are all good ideas! If the breakup is still a little too fresh, she might need more time until she’s ready to hang out with you casually again. Give her some space, then try asking again."

      "content": "Sagittariuses don’t like to live in the past. This fire sign is all about expansion, optimism, and forward momentum, and they hate stagnant energy. Instead of bringing up things about your previous relationship, focus on what you’re doing right now and how much fun you’re having. If you’re constantly wallowing in what went wrong or bringing up all your old memories together, this might turn her off. For example, you might say something like, “I’m so happy we’re spending time together again. I’m having a lot of fun with you.” Or, “Isn’t this nice? I love taking adventures with you, and I’m so excite to explore our new relationship even more”"

      "content": "Show her that you’ve changed, and that you two can make things work. Sagittarius women aren’t ones for focusing on the past, but they do think about the future a lot. If you can show her that you’ve learned from your mistakes and that things will be different from now on, she’ll be more likely to see a future with you again and take you back. For instance, you might say, “I really think that we could work out now. I’ve grown a lot, and I’m sure you have too, so why don’t we give this another shot?” Or, “Are you open to trying this again? I’ve learned a lot from our time together, and I think I could be a better partner to you.” Be patient! It may take a while for the two of you to get to this point, but if you’re consistent, honest, and committed, you might just win her over again in time!"
