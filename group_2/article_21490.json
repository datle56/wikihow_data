      "content": "Gather your supplies. First, choose a wax for your hair. There are many kinds of mustache wax available. If your mustache hair is thick and wiry you should buy a stiff wax. Inversely, if your mustache hair is thin, you can buy a softer wax. [1] X Research source You will also need a fine-tooth comb to help you brush out your mustache and a small pair of hair-trimming scissors. These can be found at most beauty supply stores. When in doubt, buy two containers of wax, one with a medium stiffness and one with a strong stiffness. Experiment with comb types. Some people prefer fine tooth combs, others use unconventional combs such as head lice combs. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop shaving your upper lip.",
      "content": "Stop shaving your upper lip. Most handlebar mustaches use hair from the entire upper lip. If you're just starting out it's best to play it safe. Don't shave any part of your face that may help your mustache look fuller. This can include the areas next to the corners of your mouth. [3] X Research source It may take up to three months for your mustache to become thick and glorious. Don't give up! Don't trim your mustache, even the parts right above your lip."

      "title": "Train the new hairs.",
      "content": "Train the new hairs. Once your mustache is long enough to comb, start training your hairs to keep the shape you like. Part your mustache down the middle of your lip and gently comb each half away from your nose. Add a small amount of mustache wax or hair putty before combing to help your hairs stay in place. If you use a tub of wax, warm a small amount between your fingers before applying it. Evenly coat all of your hairs by combing the wax through your mustache. If you use a stick of wax, apply it directly to your mustache before combing."

      "title": "Experiment as you wait.",
      "content": "Experiment as you wait. It takes time to grow a decent handlebar mustache. While you wait, start shaping the new hair by twisting the ends. Your mustache won't be long enough to get a good curl but you'll be able to get an idea of how it might look. In this stage you can start trimming the sides to create different shapes. Never trim the hairs directly above your lip. If they stay short, you won't be able to brush them into your mustache. Give uncooperative hairs time to grow out. Once they're longer they'll be easier to manipulate."

      "title": "Find your style.",
      "content": "Find your style. Once the tips of your mustache have gotten long enough to curl you can start planning the way you want it to eventually look. Consider how long you want your moustache to grow. If you want a large curl or a bigger mustache you need to let the hairs grow. If you like the look of a smaller mustache you can begin trimming the ends when they get too long. Never trim the bottom of the mustache near the lip. These hairs need to be long so that they can be combed away from your mouth. Handlebar mustaches look good on both clean-shaven and bearded faces. They pair well with well-groomed, classic barbershop hairstyles or bald heads."

      "title": "Use a blow dryer to shape your mustache.",
      "content": "Use a blow dryer to shape your mustache. This helps train your mustache into the shape you like. Once you've had your mustache for a few months, you can skip this step. After you shower towel dry your mustache. Use a comb to part your mustache down the middle of your lip. Mold your damp mustache into the shape you like by curling the ends around your fingers. Next, carefully dry the curled edges to set the curls. Keep the hair wrapped around your finger as you dry it. This will help control the curl and let you know if the air is too hot. Use a low setting on your blow dryer. If the air is too hot it can damage your mustache."

      "title": "Apply the mustache wax.",
      "content": "Apply the mustache wax. If your wax comes in a stick, apply the wax directly to your mustache and brush through it with a fine-tooth comb. If the wax comes in a tub, warm a small amount of wax between your fingers before applying. Carefully spread the warmed wax into your mustache. Make sure that all of the hairs are evenly coated and comb the mustache into place. [4] X Research source The wax should be almost invisible against your hair. If it isn't, you may need to buy tinted wax. If you add too much wax simply brush some of it out with the comb."

    {
      "title": "Shape your mustache.",
      "content": "Shape your mustache. After combing, re-shape the curls of your mustache by twisting the edges around your fingers into a curl you like. Once the wax dries your mustache will keep its form. If your mustache is still having trouble keeping its curl, heat a curling iron to medium heat and wrap the hair around it for ten to fifteen seconds. Make sure not to burn your face. Some people prefer large, looping curls, while others like to wax their mustache ends into straight lines. Experiment to find what works for you. Some people use a stronger wax on the curled tips of their mustache to help them keep their shape."

      "title": "Wash your mustache daily.",
      "content": "Wash your mustache daily. Check your mustache for flakes of dead skin or waxy residue. Brush your mustache with a stiff, dry toothbrush to remove the debris and exfoliate your skin. Next, wash your mustache with shampoo. This will remove the wax and skin oils from your mustache. Some people choose to wash their mustache in the mornings. If you sleep with wax in your mustache, it may leave a colorful residue on your pillowcase. If shampoo isn't powerful enough to remove the wax from your mustache use dish soap instead."

      "content": "Be careful when eating or drinking. Your mustache can pick up all sorts of things throughout the day. Right before you have a meal, spread a small amount of mustache wax on the bottom strands of hair. This will help them stay clear of your mouth and insulate them from liquids. When eating crumbly foods, wipe your mouth often to keep your mustache free of crumbs. Avoid eating soups and other messy food in public until you get the hang of eating with a large mustache."

Many experts believe that if you eat these foods your body will be able to grow your hair and fingernails more quickly. Foods such as salmon, yellow peppers, avocados, and egg yolks are thought to speed hair growth. If your mustache hair is growing quickly then the hair on your scalp will grow quickly as well. It can take one or two months to see results."
