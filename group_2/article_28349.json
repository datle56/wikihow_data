      "content": "Apply a neutral shadow to your lid and a darker shade to your crease. For your base color, it's important to avoid super light shades and choose something closer to your skin shade. Use a shadow brush to apply the base color all over your lid, from inner to outer corner. Blend the darker shade that you've selected into the crease using a tapered brush. Again, go from corner to corner. Because you want your eyes to appear closer together, avoid blending it outwards from the eye. Stop it at the outer corner. Additionally, make sure you are bringing product all the way to the inner corner.

      "content": "Contour the bridge of your nose. People with wide set eyes sometimes have a wider or flatter nose bridge, which accentuates the distance between the eyes. If you want to make your eyes appear closer together, you can add dimension and depth to your nose with contouring. All you need for this is a small blending brush and a dark contour powder, which you can purchase at a pharmacy or a beauty supply store. Dip your brush into the powder and tap off any excess powder. You want your nose contour to look natural, so avoid packing on too much product. Apply the powder in two lines down your nose, going from the eyes down to the nostrils. The closer together the lines are, the skinner and smaller your nose will look. [3] X Research source Blend your contouring lines thoroughly so they don't look dark and unnatural. Soften the contour by running over it with a fluffy brush and your favorite face powder."

      "content": "Line your entire lash line. In many makeup tutorials, you'll be advised to line your entire top lash line, while only lining the outer half of your bottom lash line. If you have wide set eyes, however, lining the entire lash line on both the top and bottom can actually draw your eyes together. Begin in the inner corner and carefully line outwards. As you move outwards, decrease the thickness of the line. By putting a thicker amount to the inside corners, the eyes will look closer together. [4] X Research source"

Some makeup gurus will advise those with wide set eyes to avoid winged eyeliner or cat eyes all together. By adding product on the outside of your eyes, it can make your eyes appear farther apart. If you want to wear winged eyeliner, though, you can rock it just like anyone else. If you are trying to make your eyes appear closer together, simply keep your wings shorter. If you're someone who loves to rock the winged eyeliner but wants to minimize the distance between your eyes, try out the reverse-wing on your bottom lash line. [6] X Research source Grab a flat eyeliner brush and your favorite gel eyeliner. Start at your outer corner, running the eyeliner along your lash line like normal. However, instead of curving into the very inner corner, run the line straight out. In other words, the bottom liner should extend in a straight line towards your nose, rather than curving upwards into your inner corner.

However, instead of pressing your curler straight down on your lashes as you normally would do, hold your curler at a slight angle towards your nose. This may feel a bit funny at first, but it can make a big difference. By angling the lashes inwards, it will make your eyes appear closer together. [8] X Research source Once you've curled your lashes, apply your mascara. Start at the base of the lashes and wiggle your wand to the ends, pulling your eyelashes at the same angle you curled them."

Try pulling your hair into a loose bun or a braid on one side, leaving small pieces around your face to frame it. [12] X Research source"
