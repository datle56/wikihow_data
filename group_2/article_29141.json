      "title": "Measure your guitar.",
      "content": "Measure your guitar. Using a tape measure or tailor's tape, measure the approximate length and width of your guitar. Use these dimensions to buy your fabric. Choose exterior fabric in a color or pattern you like. Interior fabric is optional for lining the case and could be in a complementary or contrasting shade to your exterior fabric. Duck cloth is a plain, heavy cotton fabric used for padding; its color won't show."

      "title": "Trace your guitar on paper.",
      "content": "Trace your guitar on paper. Lay the guitar on a piece of paper and trace around it's edge with a pencil. Then make a second, darker line that is ¾ inch larger on all sides to make sure the case is not too tight on your guitar. Cut the shape out along the darker line. Measure all the way around the outside edge of the pattern once you cut it out. About half this number is a good length for a zipper and about double this number is a good length for piping, if you choose to use it."

      "title": "Cut fabric to size for front and back panels.",
      "content": "Cut fabric to size for front and back panels. Using the pattern you created on paper, cut out 2 pieces of your exterior fabric, 2 pieces of the duck cloth, and 2 pieces of fleece/batting. Then cut the 2 pieces of fleece/batting to be ½ inch smaller all around to reduce bulk when sewing."

      "title": "Sew the pieces together.",
      "content": "Sew the pieces together. Place 1 piece of your fleece/batting on top of 1 piece of duck cloth, and then place 1 piece of your exterior fabric on top of that. Do the same with the second set of pieces. One set will be the front panel of your case and the other set will be the back panel. Then, use a sewing machine to quilt the pieces together, using straight lines across the length of the fabric. Do this on both panels. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach piping (optional). If you want to add piping to the edging of your case for a finished look, you can do so by pinning it around the edge of your front and back panels and then sewing it on with a basting stitch on your machine (straight stitch at the longest length).

    {
      "title": "Measure your guitar for the zipper panel.",
      "content": "Measure your guitar for the zipper panel. Measure the thickness or depth of your guitar from front to back to find the width of the zipper panel (The side section of your case that will have a zipper). Add an extra 1 ¼ inch to your measurement for seam allowance, and another ½ inch or so if you want your case to be roomier. Then divide this measurement in half, because you will need two pieces to place the zipper in between. The length of these pieces is the length of the zipper you bought (approximately half the perimeter of your guitar). Width of zipper panel pieces = (guitar depth + 1 ¼ inch + ~½ inch) ÷ 2 Length of zipper panel pieces = length of zipper"

Then press your zipper panel open and top stitch on either side of the zipper, about ⅛ inch away from it for a finished look that will hold your zipper open on the back side."

The width is the same as your completed zipper panel. Width of side panel = width of zipper panel with zipper Length of side panel = perimeter of front panel - length of zipper panel + ½ inch"

Take the loop panel you created from connecting the zipper and side panels and sew an edge of it to one of the two panels you made for the front and back of the case. The right sides (exterior fabric) of the panels should be facing in. Decide where you want the zipper to be at this stage. Sew the zipper section of the loop panel to the back panel wherever you want the case to open: it could be along one full side of the case, or slightly more curved around the base or neck, depending on how you would want to pull your guitar out. Use a heavy needle in your sewing machine if you're having trouble getting through all the layers of fabric and duck cloth. If you decided to use piping, make sure it is sandwiched between the two panels and that your stitch comes as close to the piping as possible. Use a zipper foot on your sewing machine for this."

Add and inch to either side of the length for where you will sew it to the case. Add about ¼ inch on every side, and fold those in to hide the raw edges. Sew a straight stitch ⅛ inch from each side to make it look finished. Double or triple the fabric or add fleece/batting inside two layers of it if you want to make the handle sturdier. You can even roll up a section of material to make a rounder handle."
