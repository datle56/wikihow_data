Different sized longboards have different advantages and disadvantages. Shorter longboards are more agile (meaning you can turn more) but less stable (meaning it's easier to fall over). Longer boards are more stable but less agile. Beginners should stick with longer boards. [1] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview. 5 June 2020."

If you're doing more extreme versions of longboarding, getting padded up is essential. [2] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview. 5 June 2020.

That's called regular. [3] X Research source To find out whether you ride regular or goofy, have someone shove you from behind with no warning. Whichever foot you put out to catch yourself is the one you want to lead with on the skateboard. If it feels wrong, try switching to the other foot. Another way to find out is to slide on a smooth surface in socks or lay on the ground; whichever foot you use to get up with will be the foot you want to lead with on your longboard."

      "content": "Get the basic stance down. Stand with your feet between the trucks (the bearings that hold the wheels), a little longer than shoulder-width apart. Angle your front foot slightly forward, at about a 45 degree angle. Have your back foot be pretty much sideways, perpendicular to the direction the board is traveling in. [5] X Research source This is just one stance that you can use. After getting comfortable with your longboard for a little bit, you very well could find that other stances work better for you. Go with what feels comfortable."

      "content": "Practice moving yourself forward. Take your back foot off the board and use the ground as something to push off of. You can go for one big push, or several smaller pushes. Try to keep your body loose as you push off; the stiffer your body is, the harder it will be to keep your balance. If you want to use your front foot to push off, give it a try. Most boarders don't do this — it's called \"mongo\" — but it's more important do ride comfortably than do what other people do. [8] X Research source After you get the hang of it, practice generating more speed by doing harder kicks. You'll find that, after you've gotten to a certain speed, one good push will keep you going for quite a while."

Heel edge carving: you move your heels downward and you turn to your inside . Heel edge turns for people who ride regular give you left turns. Toe edge carving: you move your toes downward and you turn to your outside . Toe edge turns for people who ride regular give you right turns."

      "content": "Find a way to stop your skateboard or to slow down. Foot-braking, where you drag one foot on the ground, is probably the most reliable way to stop or slow down: you're creating a lot of friction with your foot, thereby slowing the momentum of the board down. Other ways that you can break include: Carving: snaking down the hill by leaning from side to side pushes on your wheels and will help keep speed down. Air braking: at high speeds, simply standing up and putting your arms out can slow you considerably."

In order to slide, you should either buy slide gloves, or attach squares of cutting board (find it in the supermarket) to work gloves. Once you have your gloves, you're ready to go learn to slide! In order to slide: [10] X Research source Point your front foot forward while bending your knees; shift your weight to the front. Slide your back foot off your board, flexing your front knee to make contact with the ground. Apply gradual pressure to stop Try not to use your toes or heel to touch the ground; instead, opt for the middle of your sole. It is also very important you don't put weight on your back foot. Doing that will almost ensure you will slip backwards. Try to keep more weight on the foot you have in front, leaning forwards is much safer than leaning back."
