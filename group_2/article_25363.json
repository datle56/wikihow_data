Even if you decide you’re ready to start a family , your partner may have a different outlook on their life. Sit down with your partner and ask them if and when they picture a family in their future, and let them know how you’re feeling about the subject. You might say, “I feel that we’re at a point in our relationship where we might start thinking about children, and want to know how you feel about it.” Respect your partner’s choice if they’re not ready yet. They may warm up to the idea the more they think about it. Ask yourselves: How many kids do we want? Do we want them now, or is it better to wait? There’s no right or wrong answer, but it’s helpful to explore these questions."

While you can raise a family as a single parent, it’ll be a lot easier knowing that you can rely on your partner to handle some of the responsibilities, too.

There’s going to be some ups and downs of raising a family, but the important part is that you still look forward to the time you get to spend together.

Am I hoping a family will make me happy? Do I only want them because I think it’s something I should want, or other people want for me?"
