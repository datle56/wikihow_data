This includes, but not limited to, moral, spiritual, social, sexual, political, and economic issues, which are subject to a set of laws and penalties derived from the Qur'an and the practices of the Prophet Muhammad. A good Muslim aims to be mindful of God throughout each day and will spend time each day contemplating and preparing for the afterlife. Muslims make efforts to strengthen their faith (emaan) as this provides protection from Allah's punishment in this world and the afterlife. Each day is organized around the five daily mandatory prayer times, with worship prioritized over other all activities. Seeking and spreading religious knowledge is an important, lifelong obligation on every Muslim, in order that they can improve their worship and learn how God wishes them to live their lives. Islam includes a mandatory dress code for men, women and children, which helps to identify the wearer as a Muslim."

      "title": "Understand the Islamic concept of God.",
      "content": "Understand the Islamic concept of God. In Arabic, the word God is \"Allah\" (الله), which is derived from \"the God\" (الْإِلٰه, transliteration: al-ilāh ). [7] X Research source . Allah is not a formal name of God (there are 99 names of God in Islam, and Allah is not one of them); it is a title used heavily in Islamic scripture. Allah is the one and only creator of the creation, is beyond anything we can conceive (transcendent and incomprehensible), knows everything (omniscient), is beyond time and physical space, can do whatever He wishes (omnipotent), is uncreated, has no gender or sex, and has no children or parents. Allah is forgiving, merciful, and compassionate, but also just and can be severe in punishment for those that disobey Him if they do not repent of their sins. [8] X Research source Muslims should have an understanding of Allah's perfect attributes, also known as the 99 names of Allah. Allah is referred to as \"He\" because in the Arabic language, \"He\" is masculine inclusive (the word is not merely limited to refer to males). As Allah is transcendent (does not resemble the creation), Allah has no gender or sex because gender and sex are attributes of the creation. Allah is not only God over the Muslims, but is the God of all people and all creation. Just because people choose to call God by different names does not mean that there are different Gods. Interestingly, most Arab Jews and Arab Christians also refer to God as \"Allah\". Muslims often simply don't translate the word in order to refer to the Islamic understanding and worship of God (a few qualities being omnipotent, transcendent, incomprehensible, merciful, and beneficent). Muslims, Christians, and Jews worship the same Abrahamic God, despite some differences as to God's attributes. In Christianity, this is the \"Father\" as Islam views the individuals of the Trinity as separate. However, Muslims and Jews deem it impossible and sinful to depict God. Allah was never represented by an idol by the Meccan polytheists. He was still worshipped as the high God over all other false gods and idols. Muslims believe that Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) preached Islamic monotheism in ancient Arabia, but the teachings were later corrupted. Idolatry was introduced by a man named Amr Ibn Luhay.

Muslims solely worship the unseen and omniscient Creator, Allah. Muslims ask God to bless Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) many times each day, including every time his name is mentioned. Muslims must seek to follow the practices and example of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), in all aspects of life, especially worship. This is known as the Sunnah. Many Islamic laws and penalties were first applied by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). These helped to uphold the moral standards of Islam and establish a safe and secure society."

However, none of those original scriptures are in existence today in their entirety, or at all. Therefore, Muslims follow the subsequent, final, and preserved revelation of God – the Qur'an. The previous scriptures are: Torah (Tawrat) given to Moses (Musa) Psalms (Zabur) given to David (Dawud). Injil (Gospel of Jesus) given to Jesus (Isa) The New Testament may contain fragments of the Injil and Jesus' sayings, but it was not revealed by God. Rather, it was written down later (according to Christians as well). Other scriptures include: the Scrolls of Abraham (Ṣuḥuf Ibrāhīm), Book of John the Baptist (Kitāb Yaḥyā), and the Scrolls of Moses (Ṣuḥuf Mūsā)."

      "title": "Learn about the Qur’an (Arabic:",
      "content": "Learn about the Qur’an (Arabic: القرآن‎). It was not authored by Muhammad. It was authored by God, revealed to Muhammad, and written into physical form by Muhammad’s companions and memorized. The true Qur'an is the in the oral Arabic form. The non-Arabic versions are translations, which is why they differ. The Qur’an has no flaws or contradictions. The original Arabic scriptures have never been changed or tampered with. Muslims welcome all the laws and punishments set out in the Qur'an as a gift from Allah to help ensure a safe and peaceful society. Some may quote verses out of context to claim that there are contradictions, however, these lies are refuted online (e.g. call-to-monotheism.com and answering-christianity.com ). Actual seventh century Qur’ans, complete and intact, are on display in museums in Turkey and many other places around the world. [11] X Research source Muslims believe that the teachings of the Qur'an are as valid today as they have ever been and the way God is worshiped must never be changed or modernized because while the laws of humans are always changing, God's final laws and punishments are perfect and cannot be improved upon by mankind. You can read an online copy of the Qur'an at Quran.com . Millions of Muslims (called Hafiz or “preservers”) have memorized the text letter for letter from beginning to end – every word and syllable. Chapters from the Qur’an are precisely recited by memory by every Muslim in each of the five daily prayers. Muslim parents encourage their children to memorize the Qur'an from an early age, as this is when the brain is at its most receptive. It helps develop a love of the Qur'an in the child's heart and encourages them to be enthusiastic about praying."

      "title": "Understand the law of personal responsibility.",
      "content": "Understand the law of personal responsibility. Muslims do not believe in the concept of 'vicarious atonement' but rather believe in the law of personal responsibility. Islam teaches that each person is responsible for his or her own actions. On the Day of Judgment, Muslims believe that every person (Muslim and non-Muslim) will have to answer to God for their every word, thought, belief and deed, whether committed openly or in private. Consequently, a practicing Muslim is always striving to be righteous. Killing innocent people is not allowed in Islam. Islam is a religion of peace. The extreme actions of those who claim to be Muslim may be a result of their ignorance or uncontrolled anger . One may only use violence in self-defense as a last resort. Muslims believe that Heaven ( Jannah ) and Hellfire ( Jahannam ) are real places that God has prepared for mankind, and that God will decide each person's destiny based on the weight of their good and bad deeds. This life is simply a transitional period to our eternal abode. Muslims believe that persons that reject the message of Islam while being aware of it will be sent to Jahannam for eternity. However, Muslims still must treat non-Muslims with respect and set a positive example, for individuals' fates are God's responsibility and every non-Muslim is a potential future convert to Islam. Muslims become accountable before God for each and every action when they reach puberty. Only those adults sleeping or with mental illnesses cannot be held accountable for their actions. Sincerely praying for forgiveness for any wrongdoings is an important part of every Muslim's daily routine. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) typically used to ask Allah for forgiveness 70 to 100 times every day."

      "title": "Understand the misconceptions of Islam",
      "content": "Understand the misconceptions of Islam . Understand what Islamic fundamentalism entails. \"Islamic fundamentalism\" does not mean \"Islamic terrorism\". Since Islam means \"peace\", such a term would be an oxymoron. How is it possible to have \"peaceful terrorism\"? Actually, Islamic fundamentalism is adherence to Islam’s fundamental beliefs and practices. Another misconception is jihad; the word \"jihad\" does not mean \"holy war\". Instead, it means the struggle that one endures in trying to practice Islam. Some Muslims may say they are going for \" jihad \" when fighting in a war to defend their faith, but they only say this because they are conceding that it will be a tremendous struggle. There are many forms of jihad (struggle) such as the struggle against self-desire, against the temptations of Satan, etc. Be aware of the historical truths. Islam was not spread by the sword. It was spread by the word of truth and the example of its followers. Islam teaches that there is no compulsion in religion. (Qur’an 2:256 and 10:99) One's belief must be sincere. Learn about the role of women and marriage in Islam. Women are not oppressed in Islam, but unfortunately, some ignorant Muslims may oppress them. Any Muslim man that oppresses a woman is not following true Islam. Prophet Muhammad said, \"...the best among you are those who treat their wives well.\" [12] X Research source and \"Treat women kindly...\" [13] X Research source Islam forbids unnecessary mixing between unrelated men and women outside the bounds of marriage, especially in private. Arranged marriages are allowed in Islam but are not obligatory. The marriage decision is left to the individual. Forced marriages are cultural practices and are not Islamic. Islam sets out the rights and responsibilities of women and men within marriage, respecting the different strengths and needs of each gender. Women are encouraged to get educated, and are not forbidden from working, even though the burden of financial responsibility falls to the husband. Divorce is permissible in Islam; however, reconciliation is what is most encouraged. Indeed, if there are irreconcilable differences, a fair and just annulment usually is best."

      "content": "Know the difference between Islam and Nation of Islam. Islam and so-called “Nation of Islam” are two different religions. Islam is a religion that was revealed to Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century A.D. It is a religion for all races of people and enjoins the worship of the One unseen God who has no sons, daughters, or partners and who never took human form. The “Nation of Islam”, on the other hand, is a movement geared towards nonwhites for the upliftment of minorities on a social scale. It teaches that God appeared in the form of Fard Muhammad in Detroit in 1930 A.D. and that Elijah Muhammad was a prophet of God. These beliefs clearly contradict the fundamental beliefs and teachings of true Islam and the Qur'an. The followers of the Nation adhere to some Islamic principles that are mixed up with many other teachings. Moreover, it teaches that whites are devils, which is racist and violates Islamic teachings. [14] X Research source To understand the difference between the two more clearly, read the story about Malcolm X, his pilgrimage to Mecca, and his subsequent comments to the media. Islam teaches unity and equality amongst the races. (Qur’an 49:13) [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn about Mecca. Muslims always face the Kaaba in Mecca, Arabia when praying. It is a cube-shaped stone structure that was originally built by Prophet Abraham (or according to some, Adam, and then later rebuilt by Abraham). [16] X Research source Muslims believe that the Kaaba was the first house of worship on Earth dedicated to the worship of one God. It serves as a central focal point for Muslims around the world, unifying them in worship and symbolising their common belief, spiritual focus and direction. Muslims do not worship the Kaaba or any other physical object. Interestingly, the inside of the Kaaba is empty, has been rebuilt several times (last rebuilt in the 1990's), and people stand on its roof and enter it (which would be considered disrespectful if it was an idol). They also pray on the second and third levels of the Grand Mosque, in addition to skyscrapers, which are all higher than the Kaaba . If the Kaaba was to be destroyed, Muslims would still pray in that direction as Muslims do not worship the building. [17] X Research source If a Muslim needed to pray but didn't know the direction of the Kaaba, they may pray in the most likely direction, as their prayers are spiritually to God, not the Kaaba. Furthermore, the Qur’an states to worship God, not his (symbolic) house (the Kaaba ): \"Let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear.\" [106:3–4] [18] X Research source The Hajj is a simultaneous pilgrimage to Mecca made by able-bodied Muslims each year. It is performed namely to commemorate the struggles of Abraham, his son Ismail, and his wife Hagar in submitting their wills to God."
