You can also purchase a pair of overalls at a thrift store or regular clothing store. [1] X Research source It may be a good idea to undo one strap of your overalls to look messy, much like a hillbilly. Consider going for old overalls that are somewhat worn down.

Pick a shirt with holes in it or a shirt with stains. Consider adding patches to the sleeves of a shirt you don't wear much anymore."
