      "content": "Choose a consequence that’s slightly embarrassing but mostly harmless.

Here are a few other guidelines for coming up with a lost bet game: Always choose a punishment you’d be willing to take if you lost. Pick a punishment that’s not permanent. Choose safe consequences that won’t cause physical harm or serious discomfort. Avoid lost bet games that would affect someone’s job or school career. Don’t choose anything illegal or dangerous."

      "content": "Clearly set acceptable terms, stakes, and timeline. The best way to make a friendly wager is to make sure the terms are clear, specific, and agreeable to everyone taking part. That way, you can iron out all the details and make sure the punishment fits the bet from the very start. Set a clear timeline for the bet and the consequences of losing so it’s easier for everyone to see who lost. It also helps the person who lost the bet know when they should perform the lost bet game. It’s especially important to respect boundaries if you’re flirting with a crush . Dating coach Laura Bilotta recommends keeping the focus on being fun and playful instead of embarrassing or risky. When you’re setting the terms of the bet, try to keep it light and fun so everyone—even the person who loses—has fun."

When you don’t follow through on that promise, it can make you seem less trustworthy, even if it’s lighthearted. [4] X Research source A lack of trust can prevent you from getting close to someone or damage a healthy relationship. [5] X Research source When you make a bet, don’t agree to anything you don’t think you’ll be willing to follow through on, even if you’re sure you’ll win the bet. If you do lose, have a good sense of humor about your lost bet game, and try not to take yourself too seriously."
