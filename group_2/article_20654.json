To stand out among everyone else, know your pitch idea well and show how much it means to you. Bring along a good prototype or other presentation material.

[10] X Research source If you have a product prototype to show off, bring it with you. You can also bring in computers, props, and other equipment. Give the crew as much of a hands-on preview of your business as possible. Facts and figures are okay to include if they are relevant. However, keep your pitch short and to the point.

Expect the phone call to happen several weeks or months after your confirmation letter. It depends on the casting team’s schedule. They have to get through a lot of applicants. The interview covers questions about your business background, your noteworthy experiences, and your motivation. The casting crew member will also ask you about how you developed your idea and the steps you have taken to make it a success. Treat the call like a second interview.

[12] X Research source Video submissions are usually done online after the second round of applications. The video producer you talk with instructs you on how to submit the video. Usually it is through email, but they may also let you submit it on a CD through the mail if needed. Film as professionally as you can. Get a good video recorder, work in a well-lit room, and dress appropriately. Set up your product or business, if you have them, in a good light. Explain why your project is worthy of funding.

      "content": "Show a bold, authentic personality for a better chance of success. At the end of the day, Shark Tank is entertainment. Soft-spoken, agreeable entrepreneurs don’t often make for an interesting show. The show’s producers expect you to be outspoken, enthusiastic, and passionate. Be bold, be dramatic, but also be willing to hear what the sharks have to say. [14] X Research source Think from a producer’s perspective. Ask yourself if you would want to cast yourself or watch yourself on TV. Producers generally like entrepreneurs that offer drama, surprises, or tension."

      "content": "Research past episodes to find out what good pitches are like. Whether you’re applying or preparing for a show appearance, one of the best things you can do is watch past episodes. Take notes on some of your favorite entrepreneurs. Study how they deliver a pitch and present their projects. Then, use your notes to improve your own pitch. [15] X Research source Also, study entrepreneurs who failed to get a deal. Try to figure out what went wrong during the pitch. Doing this is especially helpful for products that look interesting but don’t get funded. Listen to the remarks from each shark. All of the judges respond differently to ideas and approaches. Figure out how to appeal to as many of them as possible."

      "content": "Seek advice about the quality of your project and pitch. When you get on the show, you get to work with one of the show’s producers. That helps, but get feedback from outside sources throughout the entire application process. Ask for honest feedback on what you have to offer. Make sure your pitch is simple, clear, and easy for any potential customer to understand. [16] X Research source For example, start giving your pitch to family and friends. Then, work with business associates and other people within your network. If you can, test it on strangers to get honest feedback. When you get approved for the show, you get put through rehearsals. The producer will make sure you’re ready for the show and give you some practical advice to succeed."

Consider how you feel about it and how you think the judges will respond. Edit your pitch as needed to improve it. Make sure the pitch feels exciting and energetic before you need to use it for the show. [17] X Research source If you get accepted on the show, you will likely have a few months to practice. Give your pitch in front of the mirror as well as people you know. Practice until you get comfortable saying what you need to say. Edit your pitch selectively. If it doesn’t sound right to you, chances are you can improve it."

Go through the entire application process as needed until you get a yes from the producers. You may have better luck on the second try. [18] X Research source You can apply again as long as you haven’t filmed a show episode for your idea. If you think the producers rejected your application at any point during the casting process, consider applying again. If you were lucky enough to get to the filming stages, the producers may have chosen not to air your episode. Your best bet is to reapply with a new camera-ready idea. Remember that many people apply for the show. Even if you have a good pitch, the show’s producers may not get back to you. Your second application may end up in the hands of a different producer."
