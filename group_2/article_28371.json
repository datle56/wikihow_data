Offer to help cook, clean, or take care of something on her to-do list without waiting for her to ask. [1] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source For example, you might say, “Hey, you’ve been working hard all day. Why don’t you let me cook dinner tonight?” When you help out with things, try not to act like you expect something in return or complain about the work. That can annoy your girlfriend or make the gesture seem less special. Dating coach Connell Barrett recommends asking yourself, “How can I make my partner feel significant, appreciated, and loved today?” He says that if “You do that every day, you're going to have a great chance for a long lasting, mutually connected, passionate relationship.”"

      "content": "Give her gifts from time to time. Brighten your girlfriend’s day and show her you’re thinking of her by giving her a gift now and then. It can be for a special occasion, when she’s feeling down, or “just because.” Try not to worry about blowing money on anything fancy—she may appreciate the thought you put into it or the time you spent making it. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source The gifts you get will feel more meaningful if they connect to who she is as a person or what makes your relationship special. For example, you might print out and frame a nice picture of the two of you or buy her a mug with her favorite quote on it. Dating coach John Keegan says you can also “show up with small things they like” such as “small little chocolates, if they love chocolate.” When you give her the gift, say something like, “I saw this and thought of you!”"

      "content": "Schedule quality time with her regularly. Spending one-on-one time with your girlfriend is one of the best ways to deepen your bond with her and help her feel loved. Try to schedule a date night or a time where you give her your undivided attention at least once a week. [3] X Research source For example, you might have dinner and a movie, go for a walk together, or just hang out at home together and play video games. Take turns choosing what you do during your time together. Letting her call the shots sometimes can show that you value her wants and needs. When spending time with your partner, Keegan says to try to “not be distracted by your phone or extraneous things going on, and really be focused on them.”"

      "content": "Show her physical affection. Physical touch is an important part of a romantic relationship for most people. Show affection for your girlfriend by holding hands, hugging, kissing, or giving her a backrub. [4] X Research source Just make sure you ask her what she’s comfortable with and respect her wishes if she doesn’t want to be touched! Sex can be an important part of a healthy relationship for many couples, but try to incorporate physical touch that isn’t sexual. Your girlfriend may feel more comfortable—and enjoy your intimate moments more—if your kisses and hugs don’t feel like they come with strings attached. [5] X Research source If you do venture into more physically intimate acts, make sure to ask your girlfriend about her needs and desires during sex. That way, she doesn’t feel any need to fake her pleasure to protect your feelings.

Saying positive things to your girlfriend will help her feel loved and appreciated, which can improve your relationship overall. [6] X Research source So, if you’re thinking something nice about her, don’t keep it to yourself—say it out loud! Try a classic “I love you,” or say other things to let her know how you feel about her like, “You brighten my whole day,” or “I’m so happy when we’re together.” You can also try giving her compliments like, “You were awesome in class today!” or “Your eyes are just so gorgeous.” Use words to express gratitude or appreciation, too. You might say things like, “Thanks so much for coming to my recital. You’re the best!”"

[7] X Research source Show your girlfriend she can count on you by being truthful— try not to lie to her or hide things from her. Additionally, show her she can trust you by keeping your promises to her. One study shows that it’s best to set up some ground rules about what you can and can’t lie about. [8] X Research source For example, you both might decide white lies that save your feelings may be okay, but lies about something that affects both of you (like quitting your job or getting flirty texts from someone else) is not. [9] X Research source If she asks you to keep something in confidence, try not to tell anyone else without her permission! Being honest doesn’t mean being rude or unkind. Try not to say things that are unnecessarily harsh or mean and try to write it off as “brutal honesty” or “tough love.” [10] X Research source"

You can also be respectful by: [11] X Research source Not yelling at your girlfriend, calling her names, or talking down to her. Treating her as an equal.

[13] X Research source If your girlfriend has something to say to you, give her your full attention and listen without interrupting. Let her know that what she has to say is important to you and that you really want to hear and understand her. Put your phone away when she talks to you. Make eye contact , nod, and use verbal cues (like “Uh huh,” or “I see” ) to let her know you are listening. Ask questions or rephrase what she says to make sure you understand. Resist the urge to offer advice unless she asks for it. Likewise, don’t be afraid to open up to her and talk about your own feelings.

If this happens, try to resist the urge to point fingers or get defensive. Simply acknowledge that you messed up and offer a sincere apology . [14] X Research source When you apologize, take full responsibility for your own feelings and actions. Don’t use language that puts the blame on your girlfriend. For example, try not to say things like, “I’m sorry you’re so upset, but I wouldn’t have yelled if you weren’t always late.” Instead, try something like, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have yelled at you like that. I was frustrated, but that wasn’t a good way for me to react.” If you do want to address your girlfriend’s behavior, use “I” language that focuses on how you feel instead of sounding accusatory. You might say, “When you’re late, I feel like my time isn’t that important to you.”"

Checking in with your girlfriend can not only let her know you care about her, but can also make it easier for you to be supportive. Encourage her to speak up if she needs something, and ask her questions like: [16] X Research source “Have you felt supported or appreciated enough in the past month?” “Are we doing okay?” “Are there any challenges or conflicts we haven’t resolved?” “Is there anything you’d like more or less of in our relationship?” “Is there anything in our relationship you’d like us to work on?”"

[17] X Research source Try not to assume that you know what your girlfriend feels, thinks, or wants. When in doubt, always ask! Try not to assume your girlfriend knows what you’re thinking or feeling, either. If something’s on your mind, open up to her in a loving and respectful way. For example, try not to assume she enjoys watching romance movies just because it’s “a girl thing.” You might find out that her ideal date is going to the zoo or doing a game night at the pub, instead. Additionally, try not to assume she’s happy in the relationship. Check in with her regularly and ask for feedback. For example, you might say, “Hey, would you like it if we went out for dinner more often?”"
