You can also get an email that claims to be from Instagram that links to a site, which happens to look a lot like Instagram. When you log in, however, you'll be giving out your information to hackers instead of logging in with the platform. Instead, check that Instagram sent you emails within the IG app by going to Settings > Security > Emails from Instagram . Any emails that Instagram has sent you in the last 14 days will appear in this section of settings. Most influencers and celebrities are the targets of hackers since they have far-reaching audiences, but ordinary Instagram accounts can also get hacked."
