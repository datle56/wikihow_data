      "content": "Freshen your breath beforehand. If you have the time, brush your teeth and tongue so your breath smells nice and fresh. If you need to get fresh breath even quicker, use mouthwash, a mint, or a piece of gum instead. Pick something with a spearmint or peppermint flavor since the fresh smell will last longer.

      "content": "Apply lip balm so your lips are soft and kissable. Dry and cracked lips may make kissing uncomfortable for you and your girlfriend. Find a moisturizing lip balm or gloss and rub it on your lips thoroughly. Choose one with a refreshing flavor, like mint or citrus, to help your breath smell better as well. Whenever your lips dry out or get chapped, apply the balm so they don’t get damaged. [2] X Research source Use lip balm for a few days beforehand since it will take a little while for it to be effective on your lips. Avoid putting on lip balm right before you kiss since it could make your lips slippery and the kiss messier."

      "content": "Wait for a quiet time where you’re alone with your girlfriend. While public places are fine for a quick peck, you probably don’t want everyone to see you during your first kiss.

Some good times to try are at the end of a fun date or just while you’re relaxing and enjoying each other’s company. [3] X Research source Public displays of affection may make your girlfriend uncomfortable as well as the other people around you."

Even if you’re ready for a kiss, always see if your girlfriend is ready to take that next step in your relationship. Look if she’s leaning in closer toward you, casually touching you on the arm or leg, making deep eye contact with you, or looking directly at your lips. If she’s doing any of these, she may be signaling that she wants you to kiss her. [5] X Research source If you aren’t able to tell from her body language, come right out and ask her for her consent. For example, you can ask something like, “Is it okay if I kiss you?” or “Would you like a kiss?” If you want to kiss and your girlfriend doesn’t feel comfortable with it, respect her decision."

You can even reach out and hold her hand if you want to make the moment feel more romantic.
