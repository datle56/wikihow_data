      "content": "Measure the width and depth of the garment’s upper shoulder area. If you’re making shoulder pads to fit inside a specific piece of clothing, turn the sleeve inside-out and make sure you have access to the armhole and shoulder seams. Use a tape measure to determine how wide and deep the shoulder pad will need to be to fit within this area. If you’re not working with a specific garment, measure over the curve of the top of your shoulder. You’ll also want to measure the width of your shoulder, starting from where you want the shoulder pad to sit inside a garment and reaching out as far as you’d like the shoulder pad to extend. For example, a your measurements could be 5 1 ⁄ 2 in (14 cm) wide by 4 in (10 cm) deep. You want to make sure that the width from your neck to your shoulder or your armhole area is the same as what your shoulder pad is."

      "title": "Draw out a rectangle on paper using the width and depth measurements.",
      "content": "Draw out a rectangle on paper using the width and depth measurements. This will form the basis for your shoulder pad pattern. Since you’ll be reusing it a few times, choose a stiff cardstock or butcher’s paper to draw your pattern on. Sketch out a rectangle using the shoulder area measurements you just took and make note of which lines indicate width and depth. For example, if the measurements you took were 5 1 ⁄ 2 in (14 cm) wide by 4 in (10 cm) deep, your rectangle will be 5 1 ⁄ 2 in (14 cm) by 4 in (10 cm)."

    {
      "title": "Sketch a “D” shape within this rectangle to create the shoulder pad pattern.",
      "content": "Sketch a “D” shape within this rectangle to create the shoulder pad pattern. For a standard shoulder pad, your pattern will be an arch or “D” shape, with a little more volume towards one side. Turn your rectangle so that the edge drawn to the depth measurement sits parallel to you. Sketch in a curved line that extends from the top left corner, skims across the center of the right side of the rectangle and connects back to the bottom left corner. This will be the finished edge of your shoulder pad pattern. The side with a little more volume will be positioned towards the back of your shoulder area. If you’re drawing a true “D” shape, the fullness should be on the bottom half. This will be worn on your right shoulder. Use a French curve to get the smoothest possible line. The “D” shape is standard, but you might want a slight variation of this to achieve different results. If you want the shoulder pad to add more volume directly above your shoulder and extend a little beyond, sketch more of a circular shape. If you would rather have less volume directly above your shoulder, carve out the vertical line in your “D” shape so it’s more of an arch or moon shape."

      "title": "Label both sides of the pattern piece to indicate the right and left shoulder pads.",
      "content": "Label both sides of the pattern piece to indicate the right and left shoulder pads. Write “R” on one side and “L” on the reverse so that you’ll know which shapes are intended for the right and left shoulders. If you’ve drawn a true “D” shaped pattern, the top side will be “R” and the reverse will be “L.” If you prefer, you can draw out 2 separate patterns instead of using 1 piece of paper for both right and left shoulder pads. To do this, flip over the original pattern piece onto another sheet of paper and trace around the edges. Both pieces should be mirror images of each other. You can also make your shoulder pads symmetrical, in which case you won’t need to mark the right and left sides."

      "content": "Trace the pattern onto fabric, adding 1 in (2.5 cm) seam allowance. Pin your paper pattern onto the wrong side of a piece of lining fabric. Then, trace around the pattern piece. Use a ruler to mark 1 in (2.5 cm) of seam allowance around the entire piece. Do this once for the “R” side and once for the “L” side. The lining fabric you choose should match the fabric on the inside of your garment. If you’re working with a red blazer that’s lined in black fabric, you should select a similar black fabric to use for covering the shoulder pads."

This will create a thicker shoulder pad that has 1 layer of batting. If you want your shoulder pads to have graduated thickness, cut out a series of progressively smaller pieces. Use fabric spray adhesive to secure the pieces together in a stack. You’ll place another full-sized piece of batting over the top to smooth over the levels. [1] X Research source"
