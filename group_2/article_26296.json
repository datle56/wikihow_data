It’s easy to start looking for fancy clothes or new haircuts if you want to stand out, but just taking care of the basics goes a long way. [1] X Research source Brush your teeth twice per day. Don't brush more than that because the enamel on your teeth will start to wear. Try to floss every night, as well. Shower once a day. That doesn't mean you have to wash your hair every day (and sometimes you shouldn't — keep reading for more on that), but your body should be cleaned daily. Take care of your nails. Nails should be trimmed at least once a week; if you want, you can even try a manicure or pedicure. Remove unwanted body hair regularly. You don’t have to remove any body hair if you don’t want to, but if you do, stay on top of it!"

If you have a great pucker and wear red lipstick to make it look amazing, skip the heavy eyeliner and eyeshadow, and do one coat of mascara. If you want to highlight your eyes, skip the bold lipstick. [8] X Research source Investing in a good blusher can go a long way. If you don’t wear makeup, that’s totally fine! Remember, the goal here is to be the most drop-dead gorgeous of you , not some alternative version of yourself who wears makeup when that’s not something you would normally do. Even if you aren’t a big fan of lipstick, a good lip gloss will keep you looking slick. Lip balm is a great option if you want to keep your lips moisturized and looking smooth.
