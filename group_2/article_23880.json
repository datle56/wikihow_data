Link & Keep Source Formatting : Keeps the formatting as it was in the Excel document, however, the data in the pasted table will update any time you edit it in Excel. Link & Use Destination Style : Removes the original formatting and replaces it with that of your Word document. This also links the data to the original spreadsheet so that updating the spreadsheet will also update your Word document. Picture : Inserts the data as an image instead of a table and cannot be updated. Keep Text Only : Pastes only the text from the table and ignores all formatting (such as the lines in the table). However, each row of data in the chart/table is separated by a new paragraph and each column is separated by tabs. [1] X Research source"
