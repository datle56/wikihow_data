If you tend to feel stressed during these breaks, or if they suck you in and end up taking much longer than they should, find a different activity. Here are some suggestions: Light exercise, such as walking or jogging, can refresh and energize. A fun activity with a clear end time makes it harder to overextend your break. For instance, find a 15-minute podcast episode, or read one chapter of a book. If you're exhausted, lie down with your eyes closed or meditate to regain your strength. Set an alarm clock if an urgent task is coming up."
