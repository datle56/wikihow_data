      "content": "Review local laws to find out what services are legal in your area. Prostitution and escorting are often intertwined, but they’re not necessarily the same thing. While prostitution is the act of engaging in sexual activities for money, escorting is paying someone for platonic companionship or attention. Basically, escorting becomes illegal if sex is paid for. Before you make a date with an escort, research your country, state, and county laws on prostitution to make sure you’re not engaging in illegal activity. [1] X Research source Prostitution is illegal in all of the United States except for 10 Nevada counties. [2] X Research source Learn about state and county laws by searching “prostitution” in the FindLaw.com database. Talking with an escort or agency is not usually illegal unless it involve offers to exchange money for sexual or illicit activities."

      "content": "Look up escorting agencies or ads online to verify their authenticity. Escorts often advertise on websites where classified ads are permitted. Depending on where you live, you may see some ads in public or in the back of small, alternative magazines. Take the time to read the ad, do your own online research on the individual, and read customer reviews before choosing an agency or escort. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that high-end escorts might not be on review sites for privacy reasons. Instead, look for a consistent online presence in ads and on social media. A reliable escort should have several authentic photos available. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Read the escort's ad for prices and other terms of service.",
      "content": "Read the escort's ad for prices and other terms of service. Most escorts post the details of their services and contact information in their ads. If the escort doesn’t have all their rates, rules, and instructions listed directly in their ad, they may include a link to their agency’s website with everything you need to know. Look for information about the times you can contact them, how much their services cost, and the escort’s personality traits."

      "title": "Be friendly no matter who you’re talking to.",
      "content": "Be friendly no matter who you’re talking to. Whether you're texting or calling an escort or agency, it’s always best to have a positive attitude. Be respectful of their time and answer their questions with a friendly tone. Kindness can go a long way, especially when you’re trying to book a companion. Escorts and agencies have the right to turn down services. Being kind and respectful of their time can help you gain their trust. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Introduce yourself and inquire about the escort’s services.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself and inquire about the escort’s services. Start the conversation like any other with a friendly greeting, but tell them why you’re contacting them. If you’re calling an agency, you’ll need to specify which escort you’d like to make a date with. If you’re contacting the escort directly through text or phone call, try having small talk before asking about their services. The important thing is to treat them with respect—they’re giving you a service, after all! [6] X Research source Try something simple like, “Hi, my name is John. I was wondering if Sandra would be available this weekend,” or “Hello! I’m Bobby, and I’m curious about what your services entail.” Booking agents help monitor calls for escort services and help set up schedules. If you have any questions about escorts or the agency, take the time to ask them."

      "title": "Tell the escort or agency you would like to make an appointment.",
      "content": "Tell the escort or agency you would like to make an appointment. Saying something like “What’s up?” isn’t appropriate. Talk to the escort or agent like you would any other professional service. If you remember where you saw the escort’s ad, mention that as well. Be straightforward about what you want, so the escort or agency can know how to meet your needs. Try saying or texting something like, “Hi! I’m Billy, and I saw your ad online. I’d love to get in touch with you to make an appointment, or “I’m looking for someone to attend a wedding with this weekend. Is that something your services could provide?”"

      "title": "Avoid using code words or asking about possible illicit activities.",
      "content": "Avoid using code words or asking about possible illicit activities. Read between the lines of the ad. Smart escorts will not answer questions about explicit or sexual acts or payment for them. Most people will hang up on you as soon as you stray into that territory because it’s illegal. Use the ad as guidance for what the escort is willing to do. Trying to argue or bribe an escort or their agency won’t work. They don’t necessarily want to engage in illegal or promiscuous activity."

      "title": "Give the escort your name and phone number.",
      "content": "Give the escort your name and phone number. Use your real name! Most escorts or agencies will research you online to verify that you’re not a threat. Also, give them a working phone number so the escort can contact you. You don’t need to give them any other personal information—your name and phone number is enough. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Set a time and place for the escort to meet you.",
      "content": "Set a time and place for the escort to meet you. Avoid making the escort or agency choose when and where you should meet. You’re paying for their companionship, so they’ll accommodate for your schedule. Pick a time and place you feel the most comfortable. For example, ask, “Can you meet me in the lobby of The Overlook at 8:00 PM tonight?” Time frames may need to be negotiated as an escort might not be available at your preferred time. A safe meeting location could be a hotel lobby, park, or restaurant."

    {
      "title": "Explain where you plan on going during the date.",
      "content": "Explain where you plan on going during the date. Be clear on your plans if the escort or agency asks for them. Most escorts rely on having a specific schedule. This schedule can be as elaborate as you want, as long as the escort agrees and you pay for enough time. You might say something like, “We will be going to the restaurant at 8:30 PM,” or “I’m hoping to watch the sunset on the beach with you.” Escorts need to know the time and place of a date for their own safety, so try to be as detailed as possible."

    {
      "title": "Settle on a payment for the date.",
      "content": "Settle on a payment for the date. Since this is a business transaction, come to a pricing agreement before finalizing the arrangement. Ask the escort or agency for the price of a date if they don’t tell you themselves. Most will charge by the hour. Be clear about the date’s schedule, so the price is accurate. You may have to pay more if the date goes longer than expected."

      "content": "Look your best for your date. Treat this date like you would any other. Take a shower, put on deodorant, and pick out your best outfit. You don’t have to dress fancy, but try to look presentable. [8] X Research source For example, a clean pair of jeans and a T-shirt are appropriate for most casual dates, and a button-down shirt or tie is great for fancier restaurants."

      "title": "Leave the money in a white envelope on the table.",
      "content": "Leave the money in a white envelope on the table. Most escorts cannot accept a bank or credit card. Go to an ATM ahead of time to withdraw the payment you and the escort agreed on. Put it in an accessible location, such as on a table, when you meet up. The escort may take time to count the money before starting the date. Don’t be offended by this—they’re just doing their job."

    {
      "title": "Cancel the date if you change your mind.",
      "content": "Cancel the date if you change your mind. Call the escort or the agency if you’re having second thoughts or something’s come up. Be polite and apologize for any inconvenience you may have caused, and consider leaving a tip for the time they took to schedule and prepare for the meeting. If you cancel at the last minute, consider paying for at least the travel expenses and the first half hour of the date."

    {
      "title": "Avoid going on the date if it isn’t what you agreed to.",
      "content": "Avoid going on the date if it isn’t what you agreed to. If an agency sends the wrong escort or the escort isn’t what their ad promised, don’t feel obligated to go on the date. You paid for a specific service and have a right to refuse service. When you first meet the escort, notice if they appear to be as old as they say they are. If they don’t, ask to see their escorting license or ID to confirm their age. Interacting with someone under the age of 18 could be a felony. If you decide to go through with the date, keep in mind that you’ll have to pay for it even if it wasn’t what you originally wanted."
