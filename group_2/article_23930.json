Check the installation directions for any files you download from the internet. Depending on the file, you may need to install it in a certain wayâ€”for example, some BIN installers must be run by specifying an installation directory. If you downloaded a compressed file (such as a .tgz, .zip, or .tar.gz file ), look for a \"README\" or \"INSTALL\" file after decompressing the file. Use the more command to open the file (e.g., more README ) to look for specific instructions or dependencies."
