You want to look like you care about your job and that you want to make an effort to get there when you need to be there. [1] X Research source Better yet, aim to get to work at least 15 minutes early each day, so if you get delayed by traffic or another unforeseen circumstance, you’ll be more likely to at least get there on time. [2] X Research source If you do come to work late one day, make an effort to apologize or to show it won’t happen again. If you roll in with a smug look on your face or act like it’s no big deal, then that will show that you don’t really care about your job all that much."

[3] X Research source You want to have an organized desk, organized computer, and to generally know where your important files, papers, phone numbers, and other work materials are at all times. You don’t want to have the reputation of being that guy who lost an important file or for taking an hour to dig an old piece of important information out of your email. Not only will being neat and organized make you a better employee, but it will make your job easier! If you spend just 10 minutes a day making sure your workspace is organized, you’ll be in great shape. You should also be organized in the way you do work. Keep an active appointment calendar, a to-do list, and track all of the work you’ve done and the work you have to do. Giving yourself time to think and plan your next steps will make you more productive overall. [4] X Research source"

This will give you a zest and zeal for your work that you will be excited about going to work to try out your ideas. If you’ve been at your company for a long time or even a few months, you may see that many changes are being implemented to suit the company; make sure you’re willing to change and grow along with the company and that you’re ready with fresh ideas for how you can do your work better. [6] X Research source You don’t want your boss to think that you’re not receptive to new ideas or that you’re not able to roll with the punches.

If you want to know how to innovate, work a new system, or how to do what you do even better, don’t be afraid to talk to your boss about ways that you can do your job better. You want your boss to think of you as a person who is inquisitive, curious, and always ready to learn. [7] X Research source Of course, there’s a time and a place for everything.

[8] X Research source If you act defensive or even angry when your boss critiques your work, then you’ll have a reputation of being stubborn and difficult to work with. You don’t want your boss to dread having to give you feedback or to struggle to have a constructive conversation with you; instead, you should thank your boss for the feedback and use it to improve. Remind yourself that feedback can help you do even better at your job. It’s not meant to hurt you or to make you feel bad about the work that you do."

Though it can be hard to separate your personal life from your work sometimes, if you want to be professional, then you have to make an effort to compartmentalize and to stay focused when you’re at work. If you go to work and complain about your daughter or your boyfriend, then you’ll have a reputation of not having it all together. You don’t want your boss to think that you’d be the first to go because you have so much going on at home. Though it can be hard to completely separate yourself from your home life, especially if you’re going through a hard time, you have to work on being as focused and positive as you can. If you feel yourself getting emotional or upset, make sure to get some time alone. Don't mention anything about your personal life that you don't want everyone to know.

If you find work that truly engages you, then you won’t have to work hard to keep your job, because you’ll be loving every second of it! As the saying goes, “If you love what you do, then you won’t have to work a day in your life.” If you’re having a lot of trouble keeping your job or staying motivated, then it may mean that you’re not in the right field. Make sure to notice and savor the good things that happen at work. Write them down (and take pictures if applicable) so that you can look back on them. If you had a hand in making it happen, make sure you write about your role in this success."

You don’t have to be best friends with your boss — in fact, it’s better that you’re not — but you should have a warm, friendly, and respectful relationship with your boss if you want to stick around the company. Even if you don’t always see eye to eye, make an effort to be as positive and respectful around your boss at all times. [12] X Research source If you do have a complaint, make sure you state it respectfully and never blame your boss or seem ungrateful for your job. Make an effort to get to know your boss a bit and to ask about his plans or his family. As long as your boss is fairly open about his life, it’s important to show an interest. [13] X Research source"

[14] X Expert Source Meredith Walters, MBA Certified Career Coach Expert Interview. 22 November 2019. Though not every minute of your job may be pure joy, you have to find a way to embrace the things you love about your job and to deal with the less pleasant aspects of the job. Try to minimize your complaining and talk about the things you love about the work instead; your boss will be much more likely to keep you around if you’re positive and help maintain high morale in the office. [15] X Research source For example, if you’re a teacher, you may not love the hours you have to spend grading each week; instead of complaining about student papers, talk about how much you love actually teaching the students. Coworkers tend to fall into a routine of complaining to each other a lot. Try not to get sucked in to that trap and change the subject when people are being negative around you.

If you have a reputation of being difficult to work with, of being rude or dismissive to your co-workers, or of not taking your boss’s feedback seriously, then you’ll be the first to go when it’s time to make cuts. You want to have the reputation of being the person who could work well with anyone on a given project; if you’re known to only get along with one or two people, then it’ll be harder for your boss to put you on a team and it will make you a liability. Learn to disagree respectfully. Instead of name-calling, ignoring your co-workers, or being too eager to prove that you are right, you should work on listening carefully and asking your co-workers to explain their reasoning while calmly sharing your ideas. Be friendly as much as you can. [17] X Research source Smile and greet your co-workers and stop to make small talk; don’t act like you’re above socializing, no matter how busy you are. When the time comes to make cuts, your boss will think about the type of energy you bring to the office, and you want to bring a friendly, positive one. In your down time, see what you can do to help someone else complete their task in the spirit of teamwork. Remember this will help your company to stay in business.

This will show your boss that you care about your job even when you’re outside the office and that you truly love what you do as well as the people you work with; you don’t want to get the reputation of being the person who never goes to anything. If you attend as many events as you can, then you will become even more of a fixture in your office. This will make it harder for your boss to fire you.

Take on new projects that challenge your areas of expertise; propose new ideas to make the company thrive even if it’ll take a lot of work to carry them out. Minimize the routine tasks and opt for as many challenging and more complicated tasks as possible. [22] X Research source Challenging yourself to be better at your job every single day will not only make you more likely to keep your job, but it will also make your work much more fun! You’ll be much less likely to enjoy your work if you feel like you’re just doing the same task over and over without learning a thing. If you don’t challenge yourself, your boss will think that you’re bored or uninspired by your job. Always be willing to take the initiative.

Whether you take night classes, begin an extra certification program, ask a more senior employee to train you to use a complicated system, or just read all of the latest journals, articles, and literature about your field, it’s important to stay current while also learning as much as you can about your area of expertise. You don’t need to rub your boss’s nose in it, but if all of the additional training that you’ve been doing comes up, your boss will be impressed. He or she will see how much you really care about your job. Of course, everyone needs to relax and decompress after work.
