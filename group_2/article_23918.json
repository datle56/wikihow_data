This method requires a jailbroken iPhone or iPad with Cydia installed.

The advantage of using AppCake on a jailbroken device is that it won't randomly stop working because of Apple revoking its certificates."

Installing without jailbreaking generally lets you do all of the same things as if you were jailbroken. But if you choose not to jailbreak, AppCake may stop working for periods of time due to Apple's tendency to revoke its enterprise certificates (common with any alternative app store). If Apple has revoked AppCake's certificate, it can take weeks or longer to get a new certificate. If you don't want to jailbreak and can't use AppCake because the certificate is revoked, AppCake's developers recommend their paid app called iPASTORE . [2] X Research source"

If AppCake's icon is white with lines instead of blue-and-white, tap the icon—if you see an error that says \"Unable to Install AppCake – Please try again later,\" it might be because AppCake has not yet been updated to work with your version of iOS. It also may be because Apple revoked their certificate. Either way, delete the non-working app and wait a few days/a few weeks, and try again. [3] X Research source"
