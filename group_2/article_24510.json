      "content": "Siren Head was created by artist Trevor Henderson in 2018. Trevor Henderson (or slimyswampghost on social media) is a Canadian horror artist that’s known for drawing scary creatures and making found-footage art. In August 2018, he posted the first picture of Siren Head standing in a cemetery to his social media pages. [5] X Research source Even though he deleted the original posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Tumblr, check out the original Siren Head photo on Trevor Henderson’s Instagram page. The photo’s caption gives a brief backstory: She was on vacation with her husband and they were scoping out graveyards on the way, as you do, when she saw it. Rising out of the old cemetery, big as an old (macabre) telephone pole. Was this some kind of bizarre art piece the authorities hadn't gotten wise to yet? Even as she stepped out of the car, the megaphones on its \"head\" screeched to life. \"NINE. EIGHTEEN. ONE. CHILD. SEVENTEEN. REMOVE. VILE.\". A buzzing, doubled voice screamed random words at her. At this point, it jerked into motion, striding down the hill towards her. Henderson notes that Siren Head was inspired by number stations, which are believed to be old spy broadcasts on radio waves that play random voices, numbers, and phrases."

      "title": "It has a scary and unsettling design.",
      "content": "It has a scary and unsettling design. Siren Head is usually shown with a really thin, bony body, so it kind of looks like a giant skeleton. Because it has speakers instead of a head, it looks really unnatural and only adds to that uneasy feeling. If the image of Siren Head is stuck in your head, try looking up pictures of different things, like cute animals, happy pictures with your friends, or bright and colorful art."

      "content": "It makes creepy noises. Siren Head is said to make loud emergency sounds, like storm warnings and severe weather announcements. Hearing these noises in real life are usually a cause for concern, so it can be unsettling when Siren Head makes them too. The random voices and other sounds it can make can also sound distorted so they sound scarier. If you’re hearing scary noises, put on headphones and play some calm music to help you relax again."

      "content": "It supposedly attacks when people are alone or isolated. A lot of the stories online about Siren Head focus on people who were by themselves or out in an isolated area, like in the woods or in a rural area. The idea that you can’t call for help if you run into Siren Head can make it feel a lot more frightening. If you’re scared because you’re by yourself, call a friend to chat or put on your favorite comedy movie to help you feel comfortable again."

      "title": "It has a lot of false sightings posted online.",
      "content": "It has a lot of false sightings posted online. Other “sightings” and posts by Henderson show Siren Head standing alone in a field or forest, or they have it blending in suburban areas standing hidden next to telephone poles. Some of these art posts are drawn on real photos, so they look really believable and give the pictures really eerie appearances. Many other artists have also made fan art of Siren Head and have shared their own versions online too. An Instagram post from September 2018 shows Siren Head standing in a neighborhood next to a telephone pole, and the story in the caption claims a family went missing from their home mysteriously. Another Instagram post from June 2023 shows Siren Head towering over the trees of a forest during the day. If you’re scared by pictures or videos you see online, try to remember that they’re not real. Think through it logically. Does the picture look real or does it look like it was edited? Was it from a credible source?"
