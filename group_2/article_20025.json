      "title": "Start with slightly damp, but not wet, hair.",
      "content": "Start with slightly damp, but not wet, hair. This is important; if your hair is too wet, it won't dry all the way overnight. You can dampen your hair by lightly misting it with some water. You can also add a little bit of hair product, such as mousse, light gel, or styling cream. This will help the wave hold better."

    {
      "title": "Make sure that your hair is tangle-free and parted how you want it to be.",
      "content": "Make sure that your hair is tangle-free and parted how you want it to be. Once you have the headband on, you won't be able to part your hair. It won't be a good idea to part your hair after you get the waves in. Doing so might disrupt the wave pattern."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a thin, stretchy headband over your hair and around your head.",
      "content": "Place a thin, stretchy headband over your hair and around your head. The headband should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) thick. If you have one of those really wide headbands, then try folding it over inward. You can also make your own by wrapping a piece of elastic around your head and knotting it."

      "title": "Pick the section up again and gather some more hair.",
      "content": "Pick the section up again and gather some more hair. You will be adding hair to the section after each time you wrap it around the headband. Gather your sections and incorporate them in the same way you would when French braiding your hair."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the now-thicker section once around the headband.",
      "content": "Wrap the now-thicker section once around the headband. Be sure to tuck it under the headband. Also, try to keep the hair fairly loose as you wrap it. If you wrap the hair too tightly, it will end up being curly instead of wavy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep going until you reach the back of your head.",
      "content": "Keep going until you reach the back of your head. Continue to gather and wrap sections of hair around the headband until you reach the back of your head. You'll stop halfway around your head. You should have half of your hair wrapped at this point."

      "content": "Repeat the process on the other side of your head. Repeat the gathering and wrapping process for the other side of your head, and stop when you reach the back of your head. You will likely have a long tail left over. That is okay. You will tuck it in during the next step."

    {
      "title": "Twist the remaining hair into a rope.",
      "content": "Twist the remaining hair into a rope. Reach around to the back of your head and find the extra hair strands that you didn't tuck in. Twirl them into a rope. If you have enough room in your headband, you can try wrapping that rope around the headband. If you do not have enough room, roll the rope into a bun, then secure it to the back of your head with bobby pins. You should also tuck or pin any flyaway strands or loose strands the managed to escape the wrapping process."

      "title": "Adjust the headband if necessary.",
      "content": "Adjust the headband if necessary. If the headband is tight, it may leave an imprint on your forehead the next day. To prevent this from happening, simply slide the headband up on your forehead until it reaches your hairline."

      "title": "Remove the headband in the morning and style your hair.",
      "content": "Remove the headband in the morning and style your hair. Start by pulling out any bobby pins. Gently slide the headband up and out of your hair. If it does not come off easily, you may have to unwind the strands of hair from around it. Do not pull too hard, however; if you do, you may end up stretching the waves out. Once you have the headband and bobby pins out, you can comb your fingers through your hair to soften the waves. For extra hold to make your style last longer, set your waves with some hairspray or styling cream."

If you choose an old sock that is too loose, the ring might not hold later on. Make sure that the sock is clean, but not one that you will wear again. You will be cutting this sock."

Bring sections of your hair over the sock ring before tucking them securely under the sock. Make sure that the hair is spread out evenly so that the waves will be even later on. All the ends need to be tucked under the sock before you can press on.

As you roll, keep your ponytail straight up so that the hair remains taut. You should not need to pin the bun in place. It will usually be secure enough on its own thanks to the elasticity of the sock. Consider slipping another sock or bun wrap over your sock bun. This will keep the hair in place while you sleep. If you use another sock, make sure that you slide it all the way onto the bun, so that the sock doesn't flop around."

If your hair is not quite the way you want it, you can work with it to try to increase the wave. You can add more styling products, such as mousse, gel, or styling cream, and then scrunch. This may add more waves. If your waves are too tight, try running your fingers through them, or brushing them gently. This will help soften the wave."
