      "title": "Both personality types are extremely creative and perceptive.",
      "content": "Both personality types are extremely creative and perceptive. INTP and ENFP are both iNtuitive instead of Sensory. This means they both prefer to take in information by analyzing patterns and reading between the lines instead of just memorizing the facts. This imaginative approach to life means they can easily connect over their shared innovation and love of more abstract, philosophical ideas. [1] X Research source Common shared interests for INTP and ENFP include art, music, writing, psychology, religion, history, and metaphysics."

    {
      "title": "ENFP and INTP are both goal-oriented and independent.",
      "content": "ENFP and INTP are both goal-oriented and independent. ENFP and INTP’s natural intuition means their heads are often filled with boundless possibilities. Because of this, both personality types are extremely ambitious. Their shared passion and drive create a natural attraction and spark between them. Even if their specific goals are different, they can easily use their mutual motivation to push each other as individuals and as a partnership. [2] X Research source ENFP can use their extroversion and people skills to encourage collaboration for INTP’s goals. Having a team will make achieving their objectives easier. Meanwhile, INTP can use their logic and objectivity to help ENFP narrow their focus and set more realistic goals ."

    {
      "title": "ENFP can help INTP step outside their comfort zone.",
      "content": "ENFP can help INTP step outside their comfort zone. The E in ENFP stands for Extroversion, which means ENFPs gain energy and inspiration by meeting new people and trying new things. [3] X Research source While INTP loves spontaneity, their introversion causes them to isolate themselves and miss out on opportunities. ENFP’s inherent kindness and comfort in taking risks can help INTP learn to put themselves out there more often. ENFP and INTP make a great match when it comes to taking risks . ENFP’s compassion can help INTP open up without feeling judged, while INTP will be realistic (but not pessimistic) about what could go wrong and how to prepare accordingly."

    {
      "title": "INTP can help ENFP get in touch with their inner thoughts.",
      "content": "INTP can help ENFP get in touch with their inner thoughts. The Introverted-iNtuitive combo means INTPs are naturally introspective. They spend a lot of time alone, processing and re-examining every interaction. While ENFP is also iNtuitive, because they spend so much time with people, they can often forget to take time for self-reflection. [4] X Research source INTP encourages ENFP to soul search in a more meaningful way, which increases ENFP’s self-awareness and makes them feel more connected to the world around them. INTP is never offended by ENFP needing space. In fact, they encourage it! Their non-judgemental personalities allow ENFP to feel more comfortable in their own company and thus more comfortable in their relationship with INTP."

      "title": "ENFP can help INTP make new friends in group settings.",
      "content": "ENFP can help INTP make new friends in group settings. INTPs are brilliant, but have a habit of getting in their own head and withdrawing when they run out of conversation. ENFP’s natural social skills can help them work through awkward conversational lulls and include INTP more actively, so INTP can have more meaningful conversations and connect with others more easily. [5] X Research source Because ENFP is iNtuitive, they can naturally pick up on which topics might interest INTP and whatever other personalities they’re both talking to. For example, if INTP loves music, but the conversation is all about sports, ENFP could easily pivot with something like “It’s crazy how many sports references there are in hip hop. Wouldn’t you agree, [INTP’s name]?”"

    {
      "title": "Both personality types have similar love languages.",
      "content": "Both personality types have similar love languages. Because INTP and ENFP are both iNtuitive, they’re often more than content just spending quality time with each other chatting about life. While Sensors may prefer more concrete, tactical displays of affection (gifts, acts of service), INTP and ENFP usually just like being in each other’s presence. This shared form of affection makes it easy for them to keep each other happy in romantic relationships. [6] X Research source Other common love languages for INTP and ENFP are physical touch (kisses, hugs, hand holding) and words of affirmation (compliments)."
    },
    {
      "title": "ENFP is more idealistic and whimsical.",
      "content": "ENFP is more idealistic and whimsical. Myers-Briggs types with the Thinking (T) trait tend to be more bogged down by logic and rationality than Feelers. Because of this, ENFP is more likely to be swept up in dreamy-eyed romance than INTP. [7] X Research source This difference can lead to conflict, but if both personalities communicate effectively, INTP can help show ENFP the value of a steady, simple love affair while ENFP can encourage INTP to embrace sentimentality every now and then. Buying flowers for each other is a great compromise for both personalities’ views on romance. They’re charming and tender without being over the top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Both personality types value loyalty and support.",
      "content": "Both personality types value loyalty and support. ENFP is often referred to as “The Campaigner” since they’re committed advocates for the people they care about. [8] X Research source This works well with INTP whose no-nonsense outlook on life means they refuse to play games. [9] X Research source Both personalities’ faith and commitment to their loved ones make it easy for them to trust each other, which allows for romantic relationships to blossom fairly quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "ENFP is more comfortable with emotional vulnerability.",
      "content": "ENFP is more comfortable with emotional vulnerability. Since ENFP is an Extroverted Feeler, they draw strength from sharing their emotions freely. INTP, on the other hand, isn’t used to emotions and may try to rationalize their feelings instead of just letting them flow naturally. If INTP can get over this initial discomfort, ENFP can use their empathy to help INTP get in touch with their inner feelings, which will allow for deeper, more complex introspection (something INTP values greatly). One easy way ENFP and INTP can get more comfortable being emotionally vulnerable is by saying “I feel _____ because _____” every time they see each other. Then, the other can respond with “I understand you feel ______ because ______” to affirm this emotion in a non-judgmental way. For example, INTP might say “I feel awkward because I have to share my feelings.” ENFP can then respond with “I understand you feel awkward because you have to share your feelings. I appreciate you doing so anyway.”"

      "title": "Both personality types connect over long, conceptual conversations.",
      "content": "Both personality types connect over long, conceptual conversations. Since ENFP and INTP are both iNtuitives, they’re more than happy simply theorizing about life. While Sensory personality types need hands-on experience to engage and prefer talking about what is, these 2 can shoot the breeze for hours about what could be. This shared appreciation of weirder, more abstract ideas makes INTP and ENFP feel like kindred spirits whenever they’re around each other. [10] X Research source For example, while an ISTP and ESFP would prefer talking about what happened at work that day (the sales that were made, who said what), INTP and ENFP prefer breaking down why people said those things, and predicting what might happen next as a result."
    },
    {
      "title": "INTP can help ENFP stand their ground.",
      "content": "INTP can help ENFP stand their ground. The T in INTP stands for Thinker, instead of Feeler, which means INTP isn’t easily phased by other people’s emotions. ENFP, on the other hand, is more empathetic and emotionally aware but has a habit of sacrificing their own well-being to appease others. INTP’s refusal to people-please can help ENFP establish boundaries and avoid being manipulated by less kind personality types. [11] X Research source INTP can use their no-nonsense attitude to make ENFP’s boundaries clear, while ENFP can use their warmer disposition to soften any harsh language and avoid offending anyone."
    },
    {
      "title": "INTP values directness while ENFP values empathy.",
      "content": "INTP values directness while ENFP values empathy. When it comes to communicating, INTP prefers to receive information in the shortest, most head-on way possible (even if it might upset them). ENFP, on the other hand, prefers that everyone’s feelings be recognized and valued. They don’t mind meandering conversations or beating around the bush if it avoids hurting people. [12] X Research source For example, if both ENFP and INTP made a mistake at work, INTP would prefer their boss to say “You screwed up inputting the orders and now we’re backlogged. Please fix this.” ENFP, however, would find this to be blunt and rude. ENFP would probably prefer something like “I think your stress caused you to input the wrong order number. If you could correct this to fix our backlog, that would be awesome. Also, if you’re feeling overwhelmed, I’m here to talk.” INTP, however, would find all those extra words to be a roundabout waste of time. Both personalities will likely need to make some compromises if they hope to communicate effectively. ENFP will need to learn to be more up-front when they speak, while INTP will need to learn to use “I feel” statements so their words don’t feel like blame or confrontation."

      "title": "INTP and ENFP both value spontaneity.",
      "content": "INTP and ENFP both value spontaneity. The P in INTP and ENFP stands for Perceive, which means both of these personalities prefer to remain flexible and open to new situations. While types that end in J (for Judge) are extensive planners, ENFP and INTP have a more go-with-the-flow attitude. This free-spirited outlook means neither personality feels pressured by the other, so they’re more comfortable being themselves. This authenticity deepens their relationship and increases their compatibility. [13] X Research source ENFP and INTP are spontaneous in different ways. While both personalities love acting on spur-of-the-moment ideas and loathe rigid routines, ENFP prefers to embark on new adventures with others while INTP prefers to learn new hobbies and skills on their own."
    },
    {
      "title": "ENFP’s expansive personality may stress INTP out.",
      "content": "ENFP’s expansive personality may stress INTP out. While ENFP usually expands INTP’s comfort zone for the better, if they don’t give INTP enough time to recharge, this can cause tension. ENFP should be especially cautious of leaving INTP in crowded spaces alone. While INTP is more than open to expanding their horizons, not having ENFP’s warm guidance can make them feel isolated and easily overwhelmed. Regular check-ins are an easy way for ENFP to expand INTP’s horizons without overwhelming them. It might also help to get a gauge of how long INTP thinks they can spend socializing before entering a group setting. That way, ENFP can know when to wrap things up."
    },
    {
      "title": "INTP may be too critical for ENFP.",
      "content": "INTP may be too critical for ENFP. Because INTP tends to look at life analytically and objectively, their thoughts and language may be a bit too harsh for ENFP at times. While INTP may consider how each personality feels about every detail to be a waste of time, prioritizing these emotional needs is essential to making ENFP feel validated and respected. [14] X Research source Whenever INTP is feeling critical, it can help to use the Oreo cookie approach. Starting with a compliment, then giving a legitimate criticism, then ending with another compliment is a great way to get their point across without making ENFP feel ganged up on. For example, INTP might say “I love your sense of humor. Although, I’d appreciate it if you’d be a bit more sincere right now since I’m not in a laughing mood. That being said, I’m so thankful to be with someone that always makes me smile.”"

    {
      "title": "Both personalities may neglect the practicalities of life.",
      "content": "Both personalities may neglect the practicalities of life. Since INTP and ENFP are each iNtuitive, they tend to prefer the more creative, theoretical parts of day-to-day existence. While this means they have a lot in common and will regularly nurture each other’s ideas, having no grounding force makes it likely that this pair will neglect some of life’s less exciting but important details (taxes, household chores, etc). [15] X Research source Since neither personality really likes dealing with the more mundane details, it can help to distribute those responsibilities evenly. For example, ENFP can take care of dishes while INTP can take care of dusting, or INTP can balance the checkbook while ENFP deals with insurance."

      "content": "INTP and ENFP communicate well, though they value logic and emotions differently. While INTP tends to be more analytical and ENFP prioritizes people’s feelings more often, both personalities view the world in a unique, conceptual way. Their shared optimism and love of innovation mean they speak each other’s language beautifully. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Both personalities are spontaneous, but in different ways.",
      "content": "Both personalities are spontaneous, but in different ways. ENFP and INTP each have a laid-back approach to life and prefer constant motion to a rigid routine. However, ENFP prefers to adventure socially while INTP prefers to adventure intellectually. If they can meet each other halfway (with ENFP becoming more introspective and INTP stepping outside their comfort zone), they’ll find joy and harmony in each other’s company. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "ENFP and INTP’s similar approaches to love make them great partners.",
      "content": "ENFP and INTP’s similar approaches to love make them great partners. Both personalities value loyalty and emotional support (though ENFP expresses it more often). Their shared commitment to each other makes it easy for them to overcome the minor setbacks all romantic couples go through. Plus, ENFP can help bring out the sentimentality in INTP while INTP can bring out ENFP’s inner strength. [18] X Research source"
