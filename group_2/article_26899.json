      "title": "Beat the butter.",
      "content": "Beat the butter. Buttercream's texture is dependent on light, fluffy butter. It's necessary to start with softened (not melted) butter and beat it until it takes on a pale yellow hue and becomes quite malleable â€” this is important to stop your mixture from becoming too liquid. Use an electric mixture or a stand mixer to beat your butter; it'll be a lot harder to whip in enough air using a whisk."

      "title": "Add the sugar.",
      "content": "Add the sugar. Start with 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. Measure it out and dump it gradually in your mixing bowl with the fluffy butter, then beat on low until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Turn the mixer to a higher speed and keep beating until the combination is light as a feather. If you want to make chocolate buttercream, now's the time to add some unsweetened cocoa powder. Start with 1/2 cup. If you want the buttercream to be more chocolatey, you can always add more. You can flavor your buttercream with other spices if you're not into chocolate. Consider cinnamon, cardamon, dried crushed rose or lavender - whatever suits your fancy. Adding the sugar all at once can ruin your buttercream's consistency and smoothness."

      "content": "Whip in the vanilla, salt and cream. To finish your buttercream, add the vanilla and salt, and start with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) cream. Beat the mixture until well combined. Your finished buttercream should be light, fluffy and spreadable. If it seems too dry, add another tablespoon of cream - up to four total. If it seems too wet, add more sugar. You can use a flavor other than vanilla, like almond or mint. You can color your buttercream by adding a few drops of food coloring."

It's a little lighter than buttercream frosting, and can be flavored in any way you like. Here's how to make it: Beat 1 cup of softened butter until fluffy. Add 1/2 cup shortening and beat well. Add 1 pound of confectioner's sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt and keep beating. Add 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until creamy and spreadable."

      "content": "Make buttercream fondant . If you're looking for a frosting more stable and sturdy than buttercream, but with the same rich flavor, buttercream fondant is for you. It's made with marshmallows and butter flavoring, so it emulates the flavor of buttercream but won't melt as easily. Here's how to make it: Microwave 8 cups mini marshmallows, 2 teaspoons clear vanilla extract, and 2 teaspoons butter extract until the ingredients are melted together. In a separate bowl, beat 2 pounds confectioner's sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) water and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) white corn syrup. Combine the marshmallow mixture and the sugar mixture in a mixing bowl, and beat until fluffy. Turn the dough onto a nonstick surface and knead for 10 minutes. Grease your hands with vegetable shortening to keep the dough from sticking. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for an hour before rolling it out and using it."
