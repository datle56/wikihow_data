      "content": "Mix 1/2 cup plain yogurt, mayonnaise, and one egg white together for a quick conditioner. While some people are little turned-off by the idea of using a condiment for conditioner, mayonnaise is a great way to add a healthy shine to your hair. The egg whites contain proteins that help damaged hair, and the vinegar helps restore a balanced pH to your scalp. [1] X Research source This little mixture spreads easily and can be used just like normal conditioner. Simply whisk them together in a bowl and apply like normal. Do not use hot water to wash your hair or you risk cooking the egg whites on your head. Substitute vanilla yogurt for plain for a light vanilla scent. [2] X Research source"

But you should always use conditioner, as it restores your hair's pH balance and lends it a gorgeous sheen. People with greasier hair may need to shampoo more often. You can use a small amount of conditioner without showering too. Just use your fingertips to massage it into the tips of your hair -- it will soak it up."
