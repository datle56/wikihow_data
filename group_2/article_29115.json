      "content": "Use Google Docs to make text-based documents. Like the name suggests, Google Docs is a great place to write out documents just like you would with a Microsoft Word document. You can also use Google Docs to share your documents easily with other people, and you’ll always have access to your Google Docs since they’re stored on the cloud, not on your computer. [1] X Research source The best part is that Google Docs is completely free—all you’ll need is a Google account to log in."

      "content": "Pick which template you’d like to use based on your document. Google Docs doesn’t just have blank pages; you can also choose letter templates, resumé templates, project proposals, and a few others. Each template has its own color scheme and layout, so you’ll never get bored no matter what you choose. [2] X Research source You can try out a few different templates until you see one that you like."

      "title": "Let Google Docs autosave your document.",

[3] X Research source You can see the autosave working by looking up in the left hand corner. It will tell you when the document is saving and when it’s been saved to your Drive."
