      "content": "Identify poor body image so you are able to address it. Your body image is the way you look at and judge your appearance. When you have a positive body image, you generally have an accurate and comfortable image of yourself that leaves you feeling good about the person you are. This does not mean that you're always positive about your physical self, or that there aren't things, like your weight or complexion, that can't be improved through healthy choices. A positive self-image, instead, empowers you through your own goodness and worth as a human being. You are important, and you do have a significant affect on the lives of your friends and family. Negative body image can be identified by: 1) An unrealistic view of your body shape. There's nothing wrong with being curvy or petite, but there is something wrong with thinking your natural shape isn't good enough. 2) Feelings of failure that come from your perceived shape or size. Even if you can improve your diet or exercise more regularly, your body's characteristics are not a reflection of your worth. Worth comes from within . 3) Feelings of shame, embarrassment, or strong anxiety about your body. Being a little shy is normal. Having an anxiety attack or some other physical anxiety response is likely a sign of negative body image. 4) Feelings of discomfort in your own skin. Being too self-conscious can lead you to over-thinking even simple motions, making these seem unnatural to you."

      "content": "Pinpoint and combat areas that contribute to your poor image. There may be something obvious that has made it difficult for you to love your body, like a birthmark or a scar, or there may be several smaller features that you just can't appreciate in yourself, like your nose or the shape of your ears. In some cases the problem isn't physical, but can be the result of emotional abuse, like someone telling you you're overweight even if you're healthy. It can be difficult confronting these demons, but only through acceptance can you move forward, learn to love yourself, and accept the love of others. Try to find a feature you dislike in yourself in someone you admire in your personal life. A good place to look for this is your family life. By recognizing a feature you dislike in yourself in a favorite family member, like your aunt, your mother, and so on, you can begin opposing your negative thoughts by telling yourself, \"I think mom looks beautiful, and people compare me to her all the time. I'm a lot more beautiful than I realize.\" Coach yourself to accept whatever physical shortcomings you believe you have as part of being human. Replace your criticisms with kind and reassuring words of encouragement. You aren't responsible for that mole on your cheek, but you are for your feelings and how you treat yourself. You're not a loser, a freak, or hideous. You're unique. That makes you special."

Whenever you find yourself comparing your features to those in the media, oppose those thoughts! Tell yourself, \"I am beautiful, and these women don't represent a healthy standard that everyone can achieve.\" This will reinforce a healthier way of thinking, which can help you with depression and anxiety, both of which can hurt your attractiveness.
