      "title": "Choose a piercer who is licensed and/or certified.",
      "content": "Choose a piercer who is licensed and/or certified. Depending upon where you are, piercers may need to be certified by the state or other governmental authority in order to practice legally. Do some quick research online to see if licensing is required in your area, and, if so, specifically ask prospective piercers if they have an up-to-date license. [1] X Research source Whether licensing is required or not, ask if the piercer is certified by a respected professional organization. For instance, in the U.S., they should be a member of the Association of Professional Piercers. It’s preferable to find a piercer close to home, so it’s easy to make a follow-up visit if you need one due to any complications."

      "title": "Make sure the piercing room is clean and sanitary.",
      "content": "Make sure the piercing room is clean and sanitary. Ask yourself if you’d be comfortable having a minor medical procedure done in the room where the piercing will happen. If you can’t answer “yes,” you should probably explore other options. [2] X Research source There shouldn’t be any visible dirt or debris, or trash or used piercing equipment lying around. There should be ample lighting in the room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure that properly sterilized piercing equipment is used.",
      "content": "Ensure that properly sterilized piercing equipment is used. If proper sterilization equipment isn’t kept on-site, the needle, jewelry, and every other piece of piercing equipment should come in sterile, individually-wrapped packages. In this case, insist upon watching the piercer — with sterile gloves on their hands — open the packages in your presence. Also make sure they wash their hands before and after putting on the gloves. [3] X Research source If they aren’t using prepackaged needles, etc., watch to make sure the piercer uses a functioning autoclave to properly sanitize the equipment."

      "title": "Find a different piercer (even at the last minute) if you’re concerned.",
      "content": "Find a different piercer (even at the last minute) if you’re concerned. Lorum piercings done in unsanitary conditions can lead to serious infections or the spread of STIs (also known as STDs). Also, botched male genital piercings (which are more likely to be done by untrained hands) can lead to severe bleeding, nerve damage, urethra damage (impacting urine flow), and erectile dysfunction.

      "title": "Do not let an amateur pierce your body.",
      "content": "Do not let an amateur pierce your body. Yes, it is technically possible to have a friend do your lorum piercing, or even to do it yourself . If you absolutely insist upon this, take every precaution possible. But — by far — the best precaution to take is to have a pro do the procedure!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify your lorum piercing site.",
      "content": "Identify your lorum piercing site. A lorum piercing is meant to be placed precisely where the underside of the penis shaft and the scrotum meet. It should go through only the “pinchable skin” found there, not through any of the structural elements of the penis. A good piercer should show you exactly where the piercing will go, and mark it before the procedure. “Lorum” is a portmanteau — that is, a combination of the words “lower” and “frenum.” Frenum piercings are placed through the skin on the underside of the penis shaft itself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider incorporating frenum piercings.",
      "content": "Consider incorporating frenum piercings. People who decide to get a lorum piercing sometimes also want one or more frenum piercings along the penis shaft as well. They are very similar piercings that go only through the skin and are primarily aesthetic — that is, they don’t tend to impact sexual pleasure. [5] X Research source A series of piercings (with ring or bar jewelry) running along the underside of the penis shaft is commonly known as a “Jacob’s ladder” or “frenum ladder.” A lorum piercing can serve as the base of the ladder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look into hafada piercings as well.",
      "content": "Look into hafada piercings as well. Frenum piercings work away from the lorum up toward the penis tip, while hafada piercings move down along the midline crease of the scrotum. Once again, these piercings only puncture the skin (not, in this case, the scrotal sac) and are considered less painful and primarily decorative. [6] X Research source You could, if desired, create a piercing “ladder” that stretches from near the tip of the penis to the base of the scrotum, with a lorum piercing in the middle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confirm which type of piercing procedure will be used.",
      "content": "Confirm which type of piercing procedure will be used. Different piercers prefer different techniques, but any good piercer should be happy to discuss the procedure with you. Lorum piercings usually occur in one of two ways: The tip of the hollow needle is pushed through the pinched skin, the jewelry is secured into the hole in the tip of the needle, and the jewelry is pulled into place as the needle is drawn back out. The jewelry is attached to the back of the needle by a string, and the entire needle and string are pushed and pulled through the pinched tissue until the jewelry is in place. There is no real difference in difficulty, pain levels, or recovery times."

    {
      "title": "Stay calm during the procedure.",
      "content": "Stay calm during the procedure. Lorum piercings are considered less painful than several other types of common (male and female) genital piercings, but there’s no getting around the fact that they do hurt. The sharp pain, however, usually lasts only during the short time between when the needle enters one side of the pinched flesh and when it exits the other side."

      "title": "Be patient and let it heal.",
      "content": "Be patient and let it heal. Don’t be in a rush to resume normal activities right after getting a lorum piercing, or you could damage the surrounding tissue or even tear out the jewelry. Follow your piercer’s instructions, but expect to avoid vigorous physical activities for at least 2 weeks, and sexual activity for 2 months or more. [7] X Research source The full healing time for frenum, lorum, or hafada piercings is typically 2-4 months, but you can usually resume most normal activities before then. Listen to your body and ease back into vigorous and/or sexual activities. [8] X Research source Don’t remove the jewelry until the area is fully healed. Ask your piercer for guidance if you’re not sure. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the area clean and protected.",
      "content": "Keep the area clean and protected. During the healing process, soak in a tub filled with warm water and 1 cup of sea salt once or twice per day. Also mist or squirt the area with a sterile saline solution 3-6 times per day. You can purchase saline sprays intended specifically for piercing aftercare. [10] X Research source Don’t apply soap directly to the area during the healing process. Even after healing, it’s best to use gentle soaps and soft cloths to clean the area. Especially during the healing process, wash your hands before and after touching the area. [11] X Research source Wear loose-fitting underwear and clothing to improve airflow and reduce irritation or chafing."

      "title": "Watch for complications.",
      "content": "Watch for complications. When done in a safe environment by a seasoned piercer, lorum (or frenum or hafada) piercings are quite safe. In one study, less than 10 percent of respondents reported negative outcomes, with irritation as the main culprit. Even fewer respondents experienced infections, but you should watch carefully for this possibility. [12] X Research source If you see redness, swelling, or discharge at the site, smell a foul odor coming from it, or develop a fever, see a doctor. Infections are most common soon after the piercing, but can happen at any time. Untreated infections will not clear up on their own. Most of the time, it’s best to keep the jewelry in place if you have an infection, but follow your doctor’s guidance. If you must remove the jewelry, it’s possible the piercing will have to be re-done at a later date. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice safe sex.",
      "content": "Practice safe sex . Whether you have a piercing or not, using a condom is always a safer option than unprotected sex. And, people with male genital piercings in particular should wear condoms to reduce the risk of piercing-site infections, limit jewelry-related abrasions or tears, and prevent the loss of jewelry inside a sexual partner. [14] X Research source Even after your lorum piercing is fully healed, you’ll be at a somewhat greater risk for developing infections at the site. Using a condom every time is an easy way to reduce this potential."
