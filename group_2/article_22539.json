      "content": "Broaden your creative side by turning the crate into a piece of art for the home. This approach is fairly simple and is totally up to individual creativity, but by spray painting the crate with a flashy colour and then by applying some flare or swag you can really turn a bland cage into a piece of 'modern' art. Make sure that you paint the cage in a well-ventilated area and away from your dog. Also ensure that any flare added to the crate is 'cuddly buddy friendly' (ideally avoiding anything unsafe that the dog can eat or chew)."

      "content": "Use a baby gate to block off a specific area of the home for your dog. This idea works really well if, for example, your home has a small space underneath a staircase or a small box office. These areas can easily be converted into a comfortable room for your doggy. Add some pillows, bedding, or perhaps hang something decorative on the walls (pictures of you with your cuddly buddy are always a good option). Get creative and make it unique. Add a lamp if the space is underneath basement stairs or is just generally located in a dark area of your home - your doggy needs light too!"

      "content": "Purchase a cover for your dog crate and subtly hide it underneath a cabinet or end table. This one is fairly simple if you have an end table or cabinet in your home. You can create a space for the crate underneath the unit and cover it with the cover as needed. This can reflect a more cost-effective route, because dog crates can be expensive (like $200+ expensive), so save yourself the extra cash by doing something that's classy, but not overly elaborate."

      "title": "Measure the dimensions of your crate so you can decisively plan the design of the table.",
      "content": "Measure the dimensions of your crate so you can decisively plan the design of the table. This step is very important, because you will need to accommodate the size of your crate when building the table. It is advisable to build the table slightly taller and wider than the crate. This way if you need to slide the crate out from underneath later on, you can do so without disturbing the table."

Follow this up by using a Kreg jig to drill pocket holes into the framing boards, so you can easily connect them to your table legs. [1] X Research source Clamp the table legs to a secure surface prior to connecting the boards. This will ensure the legs remain stationary while you apply the frame. If you don't have a clamp, then ask someone to assist you with the project."

This is important, because the boards will need to be individually cut, and you don't want them all going in the same direction. You can draw a triangle across the width of the surface to help with proper alignment. [3] X Research source All of the boards, except the end ones, will need pocket holes - using a pencil mark these about 6\" to 8\" apart."

Start at one end of the table and work your way across but apply your end boards last. Use wood adhesive to secure individual boards together and then begin drilling screws into the pocket holes. [4] X Research source Repeat this process until all of the boards are secured together (remember to add your end boards last). If either end of the table top is too long, use the mitre saw to square off the boards. You can also square off the table ends if you’d prefer a more ‘rounded’ off look."

You’ve completed the building process of the table, but it’s going to look rather ‘rough’ without a coat of paint or shellac. Shellac is the best option, as the resin is not toxic to your pet. Thus, with a paint brush, cover your table with a layer of shellac and repeat as desired."

If you had to reinforce your table in the previous step, it should now be sturdy and wobble free. You can now start the decoration process by cutting your curtains down to size. If you want to cut down on the use of curtains put the table and crate in a corner. This way two sides will be hidden by wall space.

Alternatively, swing by a few garage sales or flea markets to find one. Dog crates can be expensive, so repurposing a used crib offers an inexpensive alternative. This method, however, will require some DIY skill and enthusiasm. Don't simply assume that you can make the transition from a bed for tiny humans to one for your cuddly buddy in an hour."

If you use a full-sized crib (ca. 30\" wide, 50\" long, and 35\" tall) this will provide you with enough materials to create a very large crate. You will most likely have to cut the crib ends down, as these are normally shaped and angled different than the crib railings."

For example, the inner frame will consist of components from the crib railing. The outer frame will add further support to the overall frame.

The front crib rails do not require pocket holes along the sides, as these will be attached to the frame with hinges and serve as the gate – thus, cut this part in half down the centre (top to bottom)."

Using the pocket holes drilled into the crib rails and outer frame, attach the two pieces together for both the front and back. [13] X Research source When attaching the hinges to the front gate use tape to stabilize the two sides of the gate (i.e. the cut you made in step five). Attach four hinges (two on each side) to the top and bottom parts of the crib rails and outer frame, so both sides open outwards."

At this stage, the overall frame of your crate should now take shape, but you still need to construct top and bottom pieces. The best option for this is sheathing plywood, because it’s cheap, easy to cut, and will easily fit onto your repurposed crib. [15] X Research source If you do not have spare wood for this, take a trip to your local hardware store and purchase some sheathing plywood - it's relatively inexpensive and fairly durable."

Using spray paint is the best option, since you can easily cover the inside of the crib rails more easily with this, rather than a brush. It is also recommended that you paint the crate the original colour of the crib. [17] X Research source If the crib does not have an original colour, a neutral colour, such as white or egg shell both make good options. Also, spray paint is a cheaper option and does not require you to commit to an entire can of paint."

However, to protect the wood from dampness or warping, cover the inside surface with linoleum tiles. This will also allow for an easy clean-up process. [18] X Research source Linoleum tiles normally have an adhesive underside, so no need to purchase any other materials for the installation process."
