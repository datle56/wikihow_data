      "content": "Figure out your skin type. The four major skin types are normal, oily, dry, and combination. Each of these different skin types has different face care needs, and using products formulated for your type will improve the health of your skin. Normal skin may get a bit oily in the T-zone (the area covering your chin, nose, and forehead, in the summer) but doesn’t really get dry and rough. Oily skin is characterized by oil production and large pores all over your face. Dry skin often feels tight and rough because of lack of moisture, gets flaky in winter, feels itchy after swimming or showering, and is accompanied by small pores. Combination skin is similar to normal skin in that there will be some oil production, but you'll also have large pores in the T-zone. [1] X Research source"

For instance, if you start work or school at 9 a.m., set an alarm for 7 a.m. every day to remind your self to wash, tone, and moisturize your face. Similarly, if you go to bed around 11 p.m. every night, set a reminder to wash and moisturize your face before bed."
