Waking up your dog would disrupt its sleep cycle, causing it to feel confused and possibly lash out at you. It’s often better to let a dog continue sleeping through the nightmare.

Other signs of a seizure include uncontrollable shaking, urinating or defecating, and rigid leg movements. [7] X Research source"
