      "title": "Soak your feet in water and baking soda.",
      "content": "Soak your feet in water and baking soda. Sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is an effective remedy to eliminate foot odor as it neutralizes the pH of your sweat and reduces the amount of bacteria on your feet. Add baking soda in warm water (one tablespoon for every cup of water) in a tub or foot basin. Soak your feet for 15 to 20 minutes every night for about one week. To add a nice smell to the soak, squeeze the juice of one lemon into the baking soda and water. Make sure you dry your feet completely after the soak. [2] X Research source You can also sprinkle baking soda in your shoes and socks to fight any odors."

      "content": "Use Epsom salts to reduce the sweat on your feet. Epsom salt minimizes the bad odor on your feet as it fights microbial infection and neutralizes most odors. As an added bonus, it’s also great at soothing aching or sore feet. Mix two cups of Epsom salt into warm water in a foot basin or tub. Soak your feet for 15 minutes, twice a day.

[5] X Research source Before trying this remedy, always check to make sure the oil won’t irritate your skin by putting one drop on a small area of your body. If there is no reaction or itchiness after several minutes, use the oil. Rub a few drops of the oil onto your feet and massage it in right before you go to bed.

      "title": "Try a sage and rosemary soak.",
      "content": "Try a sage and rosemary soak. Sage is a bit of a wonder herb, as it is has antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties, and is also an astringent. Rosemary is also an astringent that has antibacterial and antifungal properties, which means both herbs help to minimize the production of sweat from your sweat glands. [6] X Research source Less sweat on your feet means a less ideal environment for smelly bacteria. Plus, these herbs will leave your feet smelling pleasant and feeling refreshed. Fill a tub or foot basin with several cups of boiling water. Add 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary and 1-2 teaspoons of dried sage to the water. Let the herbs steep until the water is cool enough to put your feet in, but still warm. Soak for 30 minutes, one to two times a day."
