Cut the thread longer than you need so there's room to tie the knots. Allow at least an extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) per knot. Use sharp scissors to cut all the threads to the same length. [1] X Research source Wrap thread around your wrist to make sure it is long enough. Cut more than you need. You can always cut off the extra thread after you've finished the bracelet! Remember to leave enough string on the bracelet end to tie it around your wrist."

      "title": "Fasten the start point.",
      "content": "Fasten the start point. Hold the strings together and tie a knot at one end. Line up each strand of thread, and hold them in one hand. Tie a basic overhand knot with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of loose thread on the end. This is the starting point of your bracelet, so make the knot nice and tight. You can arrange your strings in the prefered order before you tie the knot. This can make it easier to sort your colors later on but you don't need to do this."

      "title": "Secure the knot.",

Be sure the tape can hold it down and does not cover the knot. [2] X Research source Pull on the thread to check that the tape is secure. You can use a clipboard instead of tape. Just clip the top of the knotted end on the clipboard so it doesn't move."

      "content": "Separate the thread into 3 groups of two strings each. If you're making the braid using 3 colors, group the colors so you have 3 pairs of the same color. Otherwise, group the strings in random pairs for 3 main strands. [3] X Research source"

Take the right pair of strings over the new middle pair to create a braid. Repeat this process to make the braid as long as you would like. [4] X Research source Hold the strands in your hand as you braid to keep the string taut. For example, if you have 3 pairs of strings with the left yellow pair, the middle red pair, and the right blue pair, cross the yellow over the red, and then the blue over the yellow."

Be sure that your bracelet isn't too tight around your wrist. If you want to tie the knot before putting on the bracelet, make the bracelet long enough to slip over your knuckles. This knot is important to keep your bracelet together, so make it nice and tight. [6] X Research source Consider creating a slip knot to allow an easy on and off bracelet."

[13] X Research source If your 8 strings are lined up as red, orange, yellow, green, green, yellow, orange, red, start by pulling the red string over the orange string. Loop it underneath and pull the red string through to make a knot. Repeat this twice with the red and orange strings.
