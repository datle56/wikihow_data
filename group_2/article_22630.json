      "title": "Avoid fitted tops that hug your midsection.",
      "content": "Avoid fitted tops that hug your midsection. If you wear tops that are too tight around the waist, the fabric will cling to your skin and accentuate the muffin top. Stick to tops and materials that are loose, such as flowy blouses or button-up shirts. [1] X Research source If you wear a loose top, you can get away with bottoms that are more fitted. For example, wear a button-up shirt untucked with a pair of jeans. Or, wear a loose blouse over a pencil skirt. Try to stay away from tops that are too oversized. Although this will hide your muffin top, it may also make you appear bigger. It’s perfectly fine to purchase a top in your size that is intentionally loose fitting, but avoid tops that are well over your size. [2] X Research source Avoid certain fabrics, such as cotton-spandex blends. Instead, opt for shirts that are 100% cotton or silk, as they naturally flow looser and won’t cling to the skin.

      "content": "Choose a peplum top to create a feminine silhouette. A peplum top is a fashionable blouse that has an extra piece of fabric on the waistline that flares out and down towards the hips. This creates an hourglass silhouette, which is the perfect way to cover up a muffin top. Look for a peplum that is pleated at the bottom. This style does a great job of hiding the belly and accentuating your hips and butt. You can pair your peplum top with almost any bottoms. They look great with pencil skirts, leggings, and skinny jeans. Some peplum tops may be short or cropped. Make sure the peplum you choose is long enough to cover your muffin top.

      "content": "Try a camisole shaper to smooth out bulges. If you want to continue wearing your fitted tops, try wearing a camisole, or “cami” shaper underneath. Cami shapers are made of spandex or other tight-fitting material that will pull the extra skin around your midsection in and make you look slimmer. [5] X Research source You can also try a waist cincher under your clothing to hide a muffin top even more. Waist cinchers are made of either latex or thick fabric, and you can adjust their tightness with hook-and-eye closures."

      "content": "Add layers to your outfit to hide extra weight. If the weather permits, add layers by throwing on a vest or jacket over your top. These added layers do a great job disguising extra weight. They will conceal any extra lumps caused by your muffin top. Throwing on a blazer is a great way to add layers and hide a muffin top, especially in the workplace. It can be tailored, fitted, or loose. The structured material of a blazer also helps since it doesn't conform as much to the shape of the muffin top. [6] X Research source Adding a long scarf is another great way to create layers and draw attention away from the stomach."

      "content": "Wear dark colors to appear slimmer. You’ve probably heard that black makes you look skinny. Dark colors, such as black, navy blue, dark gray, and even dark green will help make your upper body appear smaller. [7] X Research source Try a head-to-toe black outfit. This creates a long vertical line, making you appear thinner overall."

      "title": "Try lightweight spandex bottoms that flatten your midsection.",
      "content": "Try lightweight spandex bottoms that flatten your midsection. Spandex is a tight, stretchy material that clings to your body, often referred to as “shapewear” in stores. Choose high-waist underwear or shorts that can be worn under dresses, shorts, or pants. They instantly flatten your stomach when you put them on. Make sure you buy a pair that fits your body. It should not be too tight or restricting, but also not too loose that it doesn’t hide the belly. [8] X Research source You can also consider other forms of shapewear that conceal the midsection, such as bodysuits or high-waisted tights."

      "title": "Wear high-waist or midrise jeans to cover your stomach.",
      "content": "Wear high-waist or midrise jeans to cover your stomach. Avoid low-rise jeans when you are trying to hide a muffin top. Opt for jeans with a higher waistline that will go over your stomach. There are plenty of stylish jeans that are high-waisted or midrise that will conceal your muffin top perfectly. If you do decide to wear low-rise jeans, make sure your top is long and loose enough to cover your muffin top. [9] X Research source Mid-rise jeans are made to fall at or right below the belly button. The most comfortable fit will be about 9 inches (23 cm) to 11 inches (28 cm), measured from your crotch to your waist. [10] X Research source If your muffin top spills over this fit, you may need to consider high-waisted jeans. Wear a top that is the same color as your jeans. For example, if you have white jeans, pair it with a white top. This will smooth out your midsection and make your look more streamlined. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Opt for a wrap dress to emphasize a small waist. A wrap dress is flattering on almost any body type. It features a tie around the waist that can instantly highlight your bust and give you that perfect hourglass shape. If you find one that fits perfectly, it can create the illusion of a slimmer tummy. [12] X Research source If your wrap dress is more fitted, and not concealing your muffin top as you expected, put on some shapewear underneath. Wear a dress with print. They are very flattering for most body parts. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a flattering shift dress to conceal your curves. A shift dress hangs from the shoulders and goes down in a straight line, like a column. There’s no ruching or cinching, they are very loose and roomy. These types of dresses are great at hiding muffin tops because they skim the body and hide your belly. [14] X Research source Try dark colors when wearing a shift dress. They do a great job of hiding the midsection. Look for shift dresses with a bold neckline. This will direct attention up and away from your muffin top. Make sure your shift dress is loose enough around your stomach. If it doesn’t fit right, it will not hide your muffin top."
