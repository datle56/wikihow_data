However if at your school you have to wear a school uniform most schools hold school discos where you can dress however you want! [4] X Research source Even though there's no such thing as a right or wrong style, there are guidelines you can follow. For example, dirty clothes give off a certain impression, and it's not a good one, so keep your clothes washed and clean. Also, try to avoid dressing inappropriately for the occasion. What you wear to school should be different from what you wear to a fancy dinner or a music recital. Unless you're going for a specific look and you know what you're doing, stick to clothes that fit well. Baggy jeans and oversized shirts aren't typically very flattering."

Contrary to common sense, it's the people who are well-rounded, rather than the people who focus all their energy in one part of their life, who stand out the most. Don't let your social life get too much in the way of your academic life, and vice versa. Balance your time outside of school between quality family time, studying time, extracurricular time, and social time."
