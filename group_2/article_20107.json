      "content": "Create a good sleep environment. For a sleepless puppy, you can offer a warm blanket for sleeping. Place a clock that makes a rhythmic ticking sound nearby. You can also try playing the radio softly or use a white noise machine to help the puppy sleep. Consider using a heating pad under half of the crate to provide a warmer corner for cuddling. Since the heating pad is outside and under the crate, the puppy should not be in any danger of chewing on the cord or pad."

      "content": "Train your dog to sleep in a crate. If you want your dog to sleep in a crate, but he isn't crate-trained it may take some time to get him used to the crate. Do your research and be prepared to teach your dog that the crate is a good place. Put special treats in the back of crate to encourage investigation. Make sure that when you say \"kennel\" or \"crate\" you use a positive tone of voice. This tells him that going into the crate to sleep isn't a punishment. If you use it as a punishment, you may find that your dog never grows accustomed to the crate as a relaxing and quiet place."

      "content": "Get your dog plenty of exercise. Your dog may be restless at night if he's not getting enough exercise during the day. Depending on your dog's breed, age and fitness level, you may be able to tire him out in 30 minutes or 3 hours (or more). [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source You can exercise your dog at any time during the day that works with your schedule. Although, it's best to avoid a lot of activity the last hour or two before bedtime so that your dog has a chance to settle down. Consider playing a new sport or activity like NoseWork, Rally, agility, tracking or Flyball with your dog.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source New activities mean learning new skills for both of you.

      "content": "Establish an evening routine. Make sure that your pet has had a chance to urinate and defecate right before bedtime. Feed your dog dinner a few hours before bedtime. This gives him plenty of time to digest and eliminate. Try keeping the hour or so before bedtime nice and calm which will set the tone for the night's sleep to come. If your dog is overly anxious, try giving him Adaptil. This is a product that replicates the pheromones of a nursing mother dog and may help settle your dog or puppy by reducing anxiety.

      "content": "Give it some time. Any changes in sleeping arrangements may take a while to get used to. Making sure that your dog gets plenty of exercise to the point of being tired is a great way to ensure a good night's sleep for you two. Talk to your vet about using an antihistamine like Benadryl to help settle your dog for a few nights during a transitional period."

      "content": "Consider any sleep disruptions. Perhaps there are other issues causing a bit of unrest in your dog. Are you packing for a trip or moving? Are there guests in the house? A new neighbor? Loud noises? Just remember, dogs appreciate a routine. A small change to you (like moving your bedroom furniture) may seem like a big deal to the dog. Some dogs are more anxious than others, so be patient and think about things from your dog's perspective. Then, you can make changes accordingly."

      "content": "Determine if your dog has medical problems. If this is an older dog that has been quiet and content before, try to determine if there is a medical problem. Talk to your veterinarian about any unexplained changes in your dog's behavior, including appetite, energy level and ability to move comfortably. Pain or needing to go outside to eliminate in the middle of the night can cause a pet to whine and be restless during the night."

      "content": "Let a new puppy adjust to your home. It may take a few days (and nights) to adjust to the new household and routine. Establish ground rules at the beginning to create a good routine. This will help your puppy understand the end of day rituals that lead to getting to sleep in the new household. Feed your puppy at the same time in the evening, followed by a trip outside 15-20 minutes later to eliminate. [4] X Research source Pinney, Chris C. The Complete Home Veterinary Guide. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 3 Mar. 2015. p 41. Place the pup in his crate, which should be in your bedroom so that the puppy is close by. This way, he can communicate when he needs to go outside to eliminate during the night."
