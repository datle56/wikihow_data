      "content": "Look for true cedars in their native habitat of the Mediterranean. These trees primarily grow in places like Cyprus, the mountains of Northern Africa, Turkey, and Northern Indian. If you find one outside of these areas, it was likely transplanted in. [2] X Research source You can find these trees around the United States, where people have brought them in and planted them."

      "content": "Check for dense clusters of blue-green needles. True cedars actually have evergreen needles instead of scale-like leaves that create finger-like extensions. [3] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 8 September 2021. You'll find them in thick groups along the branches, usually coming out of a thick peg-like extension. [4] X Research source Generally, the needles are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) long. You'll also see single needles in places, which indicate the newest growth on the plant."

These trees bear large barrel-like cones. You'll see them sitting atop the branches rather than hanging in clusters below. [6] X Research source These cones will be covered in thin scales. The scales fall off when the cone matures. Cones are usually 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) long."

      "content": "Look for leaves in opposite pairs. Leaves on Western Red Cedars grow in pairs at a 90-degree angle. That means that when you're looking at the leaves, they will make a v-shape along the branch, with the \"V\"s pointing inwards. [10] X Research source Because the leaves form opposite pairs, it creates a flat structure, almost like a lattice. The leaves are small and scale-like, and they often have 3 points on the end. They form long finger-like extensions that make the \"V\"s. Crush a leaf in your hand, and it will create a strong smell. The scent is a little bit like pineapple."

Typically, if the cedar is above 100 feet (30 m), it's a Western Red Cedar. [11] X Research source To help you estimate the height, think about your own height. How many of you would it take to reach the top? That can give you some idea of the tree's height. [12] X Research source"

They prefer to be closer to sea level rather than up in the mountains, though you will find them at almost any elevation. [13] X Research source While the tree is native to the Pacific Northwest, people have taken it to other temperate climates, so you'll find it places like New Zealand, Australia, and Western Europe."

They top out at about 60 feet (18 m) with a trunk that's about 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91 m) in diameter. [17] X Research source As a guide, 60 feet (18 m) is about the length of a bowling lane.
