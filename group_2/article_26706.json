      "content": "Lubricate the deck every 150 miles so the belt won’t wear out. Use an Allen wrench to loosen the bolts in the back of the treadmill by turning them counter-clockwise. This will loosen the belt so you can lift under it. [2] X Research source Then, lift the belt and apply 1 ounce (28 g) of silicone lubricant spray, liquid, or wax to the top of the running deck. [3] X Expert Source Greg Maurer Health & Fitness Specialist Expert Interview. 13 August 2021. This will keep the belt from causing too much friction as you walk or run. [4] X Research source Some treadmills are self-lubricating and don’t need to be sprayed or waxed. Make sure you check your owner’s manual before applying a lubricant. [5] X Research source While it’s rare, some brands require a specific type of wax or spray. Check your owner’s manual to make sure you use the right type of lubricant. [6] X Research source Make sure you don’t spray the lubricant on top of the belt, as it can make the belt slippery. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Tighten the belt as needed to maintain the tension. If the belt on your treadmill feels like it’s wiggling around too much, it’s likely that the belt has stretched a bit and needs to be tightened. [8] X Research source On most machines, there are 2 bolts at the end of the deck that you can tighten with an Allen wrench by adjusting the bolts clockwise. [9] X Research source There is no set amount of time after which you’ll need to tighten the belt. Instead, do this as needed whenever you feel like the belt is wiggling or sliding and making it more difficult to use the machine."

      "title": "Align the belt if it doesn’t run straight down the deck.",
      "content": "Align the belt if it doesn’t run straight down the deck. In addition to stretching, the belt on your treadmill may slide off the center of the deck over time. On most machines, you can easily realign the belt by adjusting the bolts located on either side of the back of the machine. To do this, use an Allen wrench to adjust the bolts clockwise or counter-clockwise (depending on how the belt needs to be aligned) until the belt aligns in the center of the deck again. [10] X Research source Because every machine is different, making sure that you check the owner’s manual to see how to align the belt on your particular treadmill. Realigning the belt will not only make it easier to run, it will keep one side of the belt from wearing down faster than the other."

      "content": "Wipe down your treadmill with a wet cloth after every use. Each time you use your treadmill, wipe down all the surface areas with a wet cloth or sanitizing wipe. While you may not be able to see it, your treadmill’s handles, belt, and screen likely get covered with sweat each time you run or power walk, which can cause the machine’s surface areas to corrode. [11] X Research source Wiping down the surface areas on the machine will also help kill germs. Therefore, this is particularly important if you share your treadmill with anyone else."

      "content": "Clean the area under the treadmill whenever you vacuum. [12] X Expert Source Greg Maurer Health & Fitness Specialist Expert Interview. 13 August 2021. One of the most common reasons treadmills start to wear down is the accumulation of dirt and dust. To help keep the inside of your treadmill clear, vacuum the flooring under and within several feet around the treadmill about once per week, or whenever you vacuum the area. [13] X Research source If your treadmill is too heavy to lift up so you can vacuum underneath, use your vacuum’s hose attachment and stick it underneath to suck up as much dirt and dust as you can."

First, unplug your treadmill from the wall. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the hood in place, then follow the owner’s manual instructions to remove the hood off the treadmill’s motor. [15] X Research source Then, use the hose attachment on your vacuum to remove any dirt and dust from around the motor. Finally, stick the vacuum hose under the belt to vacuum the deck of the treadmill. [16] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source The hood of the treadmill is generally located on the bottom of the front of the machine, directly under the machine’s screen. The deck of the treadmill is the floor of the machine underneath the moving belt. Even if you’re diligent about cleaning the area under and around your treadmill, there will still likely be some dust build up. Cleaning the motor will keep it running at its maximum efficiency, while cleaning the deck will help reduce friction that can break down the belt over time."

      "content": "Use the treadmill on a level surface to keep the belt aligned. Perhaps the easiest way to protect your treadmill and keep it running smoothly is to set it up on an even surface. This will help keep the belt aligned and produce less friction, keeping the belt and deck from wearing down too quickly. [17] X Research source If you want to be sure that your treadmill is on a level surface, lay a level across the belt. This will let you know whether your floors are even or not so you can adjust the treadmill’s position accordingly."

If you leave your treadmill plugged in when you’re not using it, you can help protect the electronics in the machine by plugging it into a surge-protected outlet. This will keep your treadmill’s electronics safe during unexpected power surges and outages. [18] X Research source You can also unplug your treadmill when you’re not using it to protect the machine’s computer."

      "content": "Invest in a treadmill mat to minimize vibrations. Placing a treadmill mat underneath the machine will not only help protect it from dust and dirt, it will also minimize vibrations that can make the belt and deck wear down faster. In addition, using a mat will also decrease the noise the machine makes when you’re using it. [19] X Research source Treadmill mats also help protect the floor underneath your treadmill. Treadmill mats cost as little as $15 USD and can be purchased online and at most fitness equipment stores."

      "content": "Observe the belt while it’s moving if your treadmill’s speed is erratic. If the speed on your treadmill is erratic, try turning on the machine to run at a slow speed and observe the belt to see if it’s hitching. Even if you’re diligent about maintaining your treadmill, the belt will inevitably wear down over time. If you notice that the speed on your treadmill starts to vary without you changing the setting, it’s likely that the belt is hitching and needs to be replaced. [20] X Research source In most cases, you’ll be able to purchase a new belt from the store where you purchased your machine, or search online for a new belt for the same make and model. If you don’t see any issues with the belt when you observe it, the erratic speed may be caused by a problem with the motor. If this is the case, you’ll need a repair technician to determine if it can be fixed."

      "content": "Unplug your treadmill if there’s a burning smell. If you’re using your treadmill and you start experiencing a burning smell, immediately stop using your treadmill, turn it off, and unplug it from the wall. [21] X Research source Whether it’s caused by dust in the motor, an object lodged under the belt, or a short circuit, burning smells generally indicate a problem that could become a fire hazard if you ignore it for too long. If the burning smell is caused by dust, you can fix it by vacuuming the motor. If the smell is caused by an object under the belt, removing the object will reduce the friction and get rid of the smell. If your treadmill is short circuiting, you’ll need to get a professional to address the issue."

      "content": "Check the power cords if the console display isn’t working. If your treadmill belt is moving fine but the console display is blank, there is usually a minor issue with the power cords or batteries. First, check the power cords to see if any are old, crimped, or otherwise damaged and need to be replaced. If the power cords and wires are all in good shape, try unplugging the main power cord from the outlet for 1 minute to allow the circuit breaker to reset. Then, plug it back in to see if the display returns. [22] X Research source If any cords or wires need to be replaced, you’ll likely be able to purchase a replacement at a hardware store or from the treadmill supplier."
