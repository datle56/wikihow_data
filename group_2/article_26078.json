      "content": "Listen to music on a smartwatch to avoid carrying your phone. Connect your wireless headphones to a smartwatch and listen to music on streaming apps, like Spotify or Apple Music. You can also download music directly onto your watch so you can listen wherever you go, even when you don’t have service. Online, many runners recommend the Apple Watch or Garmin Smartwatch . [1] X Research source Most smartwatches monitor your heart rate and activity levels so you can track your progress and improve your run time. They may also offer GPS so you can find and map new routes."

      "content": "Wear a headband over your earbuds to keep them secure. If earbuds tend to fall out of your ears while you run, throw on an athletic headband to help them stay in place. Choose a moisture-wicking fabric to cool you down and prevent sweat from getting in your eyes. In the cooler months, you can wear a beanie to cover your ears and keep you warm."

      "content": "Carry your phone in an armband or FlipBelt so it doesn’t fall. Instead of holding your phone in your hand, slide it in a sweatproof armband that fits the model of your phone. Loop the band around your upper arm, check that your phone is facing up, and secure it in place with the straps. Many runners also recommend the FlipBelt , which is a running belt with several compartments so you can store your belongings. Just step through it and pull it over your hips. [2] X Research source Many armbands have holes or slots in the bottom where you can plug in wired headphones. If you frequently upgrade your phone, have a bulkier model, or want to carry more things on your run (like energy gels or an inhaler), a FlipBelt is a better option."

      "content": "Opt for an MP3 player to listen to music without a smartphone. If carrying your phone on a run is distracting, find a MP3 player with a clip on the back so you can attach it to your shirt or waistband. [3] X Research source You can download music to your MP3 player and listen to it anywhere you go—just check the storage capacity and battery life so you know how many songs it holds and how long you can use it between charges. Some MP3 players may not let you select specific songs and will only play your music on shuffle. You can find MP3 players designed specifically for running online and at most sporting goods stores."

      "content": "Use a portable radio if you want to listen to AM or FM stations. Portable radios allow you to tune into any AM or FM radio station in your area so don’t need additional devices. Most of them come with wired earphones, but you can always unplug them and listen to the radio out loud if you’re running around in a more private area. [4] X Research source Carry it in your hand, or store it in your pocket or running belt. Keep in mind that you cannot choose specific songs when using a radio headset. You can find portable radio headsets online, but some fitness stores may have them in stock. If possible, try on a few pairs before buying them so you choose one that feels comfortable on your ears."

      "content": "Try open-ear headphones if you’re concerned about your safety. While you can use any kind of earbuds or headphones while you run, some can block out too much noise and make it difficult to hear your surroundings. Open-ear and bone-conducting headphones hook around the edges of your ear, instead of sitting inside your ear and blocking your ear canal. They’re perfect for solo runs, or if you’re running in the early hours or late at night! [5] X Research source Online, many runners recommend Shokz headphones . Both open-ear and bone-conducting headphones leave the ear canal unblocked. However, open-ear headphones are powered by conduction, while bone-conducting headphones work by conducting sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull."

      "content": "Pick lightweight, waterproof headphones if you sweat a lot. Headphones can get damaged or slip out of your ears if too much sweat accumulates on them. Look for athletic headphones that are waterproof or sweat-resistant so you can run without any concerns. If you want to buy over-the-ear headphones , try them on in-store to see if they’re light enough. Clean your headphones after each run so sweat doesn’t accumulate on them, and use a damp lint-free cloth to wipe the surface of the ear pads. Keep in mind that waterproof headphones can be fully submerged underwater without damage, while water-resistant headphones can be sprayed with water without affecting their performance.

      "content": "Opt for wireless earbuds if you’re playing music on a phone or watch. For the most optimal running experience, choose wireless earbuds that won’t get in your way. All you have to do is connect your earbuds to your device via Bluetooth, then turn on your favorite tunes. Just make sure your earbuds feel secure so they don’t fall out while you’re running. If you want to use traditional wired headphones, run the cord under your shirt so it doesn’t get tangled while you run."

      "content": "Pick a genre of music you enjoy to stay motivated during your run. You can pick any style of music that you like while you’re running as long as it maintains a steady beat. Either pick one genre for your entire run so you can stay in the zone, or choose a number of different songs if you want your playlist to have some variety. Pick enough songs to fill the amount of time that you plan on running so you don’t run out of music. For example, you may listen to electronic or rock music while you run so you feel more energized while you run."

      "content": "Add enough songs to your playlist so you don’t run out of music. Use your preferred music app and select songs that are high-energy and match your running pace. If you’re running for an hour, make sure you have at least 20 songs so you don’t run out of music mid-workout. Name your playlist “Running” or something similar so you know what to play while you go on a run. [7] X Research source You can organize the songs in your playlist to hear them in order, or you can shuffle the music so it’s random every time you listen."

      "title": "Warm up with songs between 80-90 beats per minute.",
      "content": "Warm up with songs between 80-90 beats per minute. When you’re first starting your run, ease into your workout with slower songs so you don’t get worn out right away. Look for songs that have 80-90 beats per minute (BPM) to help you start your run gradually and get accustomed to a comfortable pace. Aim to have at least 2-3 songs in this range for your warm up, which should take around 10 minutes. For example, the songs “Take On Me” by a-ha and “Wonderwall” by Oasis are both between 80-90 BPM. You can look up the BPM of songs online if you don’t know it."

      "content": "Run to songs that are between 120-140 BPM for a moderate pace. Once you find a comfortable pace, start listening to faster-paced songs so you can find a steady pace to maintain during your run. Put together a playlist of songs that have at least 120 BPM to help you find a steady and comfortable pace for your run. Add as many songs as you need for the length of your run. As you get comfortable, add more songs that increase the tempo to push yourself harder. [8] X Research source Many songs, such as “Teenage Dream” by Katy Perry and “Don’t Stop Believin’” by Journey, are around 120 BPM. Don’t use too many songs that change between tempos since it could affect your running speed and efficiency if you’re constantly adjusting. Be careful running to faster music since you may develop aches and pains sooner."

      "content": "Cool down and stretch to songs that have around 80 BPM. When you’re finished with the main part of your run, put on more slow music to help you relax and lower your pace. Aim to have 2-3 songs at a slower tempo for your cool down so you’re able to start relaxing and ease into stretching. When you’re finished with your run completely, stop your music to end your workout. Make sure you cool down after each run so you don’t develop aches or cramps."

      "content": "Yes, it’s safe to run with music if you’re aware of your surroundings. While music can enhance your run, it’s important to pay attention to what’s going on around you. Avoid listening to music in poorly-lit or isolated areas (if you’re alone), and consider hitting pause if you’re passing through a congested neighborhood—it can be difficult to hear oncoming vehicles, which can be catastrophic. Other tips to for a safe run include: [11] X Research source Always look both ways before crossing the street. Take one earbud out or lower your volume when running in high traffic areas. Listen to music at a sound level between 60-85 decibels to prevent hearing damage. [12] X Research source Never turn the volume all the way up so you can hear traffic and other people around you. Stay vigilant! Carry pepper spray or a keychain weapon if you’re running alone and don’t feel comfortable."
