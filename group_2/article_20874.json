Keep the heat a little bit higher than normal, since the person you’re massaging will be mostly undressed. Make sure the room is private as well so that there are no interruptions.

Try some with relaxing (but not overpowering) scents, like lavender, sea breeze, or tropical. [3] X Research source If possible, turn the lights down low or off completely and work only by candlelight. You want the person receiving the massage to be so relaxed that they're almost asleep by the end, so the darker it is the better!"

Cover the surface with fresh towels, and keep a couple on hand so you can wipe off your fingers as needed. Use extra towels to cover the person’s body as you work. [4] X Research source Ideally, the person you’re massaging will be stripped down to their underwear (or wearing nothing at all). Use the towels to cover up any parts of the body that you aren’t working on so they feel safe and comfortable the entire time. If you’re massaging your partner , have them lie down on the bed. If you’re massaging a client, use a professional massage table ."

Use your fingers for grip, but don't press them into the collarbone, as this can be painful. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you've finished with the shoulders, use the press and release technique to massage along the neck, all the way to the hairline. Remember to keep your hands on either side of the spine. Now move around to stand in front of your client/partner's head, so their shoulders are facing you. Make a fist with each hand, then rub the knuckles gently but firmly across the tops of the shoulders, to release any tension, Use your thumbs to press and release along the tops of the shoulders and up the back of the neck."

Then, cover the leg you're not currently working on with a towel and focus on massaging the calf of one leg. Use a kneading technique (like kneading bread) to work the calf muscle. Move up towards the thigh and repeat the kneading technique here. Then press the heel of your hand into the skin and very slowly move it along the thigh. [7] X Research source Apply light pressure with both hands, smoothly stretching the skin. This technique is known as effleurage, and is a good way to ease into the massage. Cover the leg you just finished working on with a towel (to keep in heat) and repeat the massage on the other leg."

When you reach the top of the back, fan your hands outwards across the shoulders, as if outlining the top of a heart. Return to the lower back and use a kneading motion to work the large muscles on either side of the spine. Then, use a \"press and release\" technique to work your way up the back. This involves pressing your fingertips firmly into the flesh of the back before quickly releasing. When the pressure is released, your partner/client's brain will release a rush of pleasurable chemicals. [8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source These areas tend to build up a lot of tension, so make sure to spend some time here. When you get to the upper back, have your partner/client bend their elbows so their shoulder blades stick out. This will give you better access to the muscle around the edge of the shoulder blades, which tends to harbor a lot of tension and knots. To work on the knots, use a thumb or single finger to press and release repeatedly around the problem area."

Next, massage the folds and lobe of each ear between your thumb and forefinger. Then, use your fingertips to gently swipe along the contours of the cheekbones. Put your hands beneath your partner/client's head and lift it slightly from the bed. Use your fingers to find the small hollows when the neck meets the base of the skull. Apply firm pressure with your fingertips, then release. Repeat several times.
