      "content": "Add 1 cup (250ml) of water to a small saucepan. Heat until the water is warm but not hot or boiling. You do not want to use boiling water because then you will have to wait for it to cool before you can use your hands to mix the slime. You can also pour the water into a microwave-safe bowl and place it in the microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute to heat up the water."

This is a matter of personal preference. Keep doing this as much as needed to obtain a mixture that is of the right slimy consistency for your needs. You should be able to put your fingers into the mixture easily. When you run your finger along the slime's surface, it should feel dry."
