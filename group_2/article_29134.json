      "content": "Do not butter the bread, for the low-fat version. Add the cheese between the two slices of bread and place straight on the preheated grill. Cover and allow to cook. Other ideas for grilled sandwich variations include: Add ham with the cheese to give more taste to your sandwich. Vary the breads and cheeses to make it more interesting. For example, try goat cheese on whole grain bread. Place a thin slice of tomato on the cheese, and grill it together. Be careful not to burn your mouth, though, since cooked tomatoes become very hot due to their high percentage of water. Add fruits or veggies. Examples are grilled goat cheese with apples or the classic grilled cheese with tomato."

      "content": "Since the grill is actually cooking on both sides, it doesn't take very long for the toast to brown and the cheese to melt. Check on it in about a minute; it might take a couple of minutes but keep checking to avoid burning. Alternatively, you can save a little time by loading the sandwich while the grill is still cold and giving the whole process about 5 minutes, though you may need to add or subtract a minute based on your grill. If you've added extra ingredients, such as meat, this method works better than starting with a pre-heated grill because it gives the fillings time to heat up before the bread burns."
