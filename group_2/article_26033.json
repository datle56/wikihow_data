      "title": "You crave control above all else.",
      "content": "You crave control above all else. If you have Lilith in Scorpio, your greatest treasure is your will. The unconscious wisdom of Scorpio constantly picks up on the undercurrents of the situations around you, and you can get a strong sense of what works and what doesn’t—and you want to do what works. [1] X Research source This also makes Scorpio Liliths attracted to power. For example, you may have more relationships with large age and finance gaps. This placement gives you a complex perspective and a very nuanced view. To keep gaining perspective, listen to other people’s experiences and take their preferences into mind."

      "content": "You have great intuitive communication skills. Your Scorpio Lilith lets you swim around in the undercurrents of interactions—you read the subtext and know just what to say. [2] X Research source People may think you’re wise or come to you for advice, even if they don’t know you very well. One of the best ways for you to communicate is by expressing your intentions as clearly as possible. Scorpio Liliths can be very good at getting other people to do things, so keep everyone informed to prevent any confusion. You're good at having difficult conversations. Consider taking on a constructive communicative role in your community, like as a mediator or general organizer. In a professional setting, Scorpio Liliths make great therapists."

      "content": "When balanced, Scorpio Lilith can make you excellent leader. Leadership is about getting the best out of your team—meeting everyone where they’re at and challenging them—while providing the supporting energy to move forward. Use your perceptive and communicative skills and unmatched energy to make every team work. To be a good leader , focus on inclusion.

      "title": "You have an intense reserve of internal energy.",
      "content": "You have an intense reserve of internal energy. Your natural abilities are so strong that you may have had to deny them as a child, or, you may have been a real daredevil. Lilith is thrilled (and healed) by power when it’s in Scorpio, and you can find extreme behavior quite fun, even if you don’t indulge in it. Playing with this energy can make you very powerful. Your extreme nature allows you to find the boundaries of yourself…often by going over those boundaries. Once you’ve learned where the edge is, you can safely push yourself to the peak of your abilities."

    {
      "title": "You experience frequent, rapid change.",
      "content": "You experience frequent, rapid change. Scorpio has a fixed modality, which isn’t usually associated with change. The water element, however, keeps Scorpio evolving, even as the river stays in its banks. Lilith turns things upside down—the constant upheaval of Lilith and barrelling forward of Scorpio can cause you to change on a dime. Even if you’re afraid of change, you’re a natural at it with this placement—you’ve already changed so much, unconsciously, even. By accepting change and evaluating your situation objectively and without judgment, you can keep moving forward unhindered."

      "title": "The power and moral drive of this placement makes you a fearless warrior.",
      "content": "The power and moral drive of this placement makes you a fearless warrior. The intellectual intensity of Scorpio mixed with the direction of Lilith (think of a hose and nozzle) propels you by your beliefs. You trust your own judgment and you stand by it—the warrior doesn’t fight for blood; they fight for the heart. Because you’re led by your heart, learn about other people ’s morals to constantly update your beliefs. If someone pushes back on something you do, have a calm conversation with them to share perspectives, and possibly widen your own."

      "title": "You find it hard to express your more “difficult” emotions.",
      "content": "You find it hard to express your more “difficult” emotions. You may be ashamed of feeling angry, jealous, or displaying any emotion that isn’t socially acceptable. You may even feel you’re overly prone to these emotions. Over time, you can harness the power of these emotions by channeling them into your work. Anger, jealousy, sadness—no matter what emotion you’re feeling, it’s perfectly natural and okay. If you’re feeling anxious or embarrassed about expressing these emotions, channel them into something positive. For example, channel anger at your surroundings into community organizing to improve them. Use jealousy to learn about what sort of life you’d like to have and to make goals for achieving it. If you find your emotions overwhelming, consider speaking to a therapist . They can give you healthy ways to use or release your emotions."

      "title": "You naturally overcome your problems.",
      "content": "You naturally overcome your problems. Scorpio Lilith’s intense and intuitive qualities makes it so that once you understand there’s a problem, you can’t go back to the old way of doing things. Because you study everything from all angles, you can overcome your problems just by knowing them. When Scorpio Liliths know something, they fully know it, inside and out, so you believe anything is possible if you put your mind to it. Whenever you have a problem, take some time to seriously mull it over. The answer may have been in you, all along."

      "title": "You view pain and illness as messages.",
      "content": "You view pain and illness as messages. Scorpio Liliths take a holistic look at everything, including your body. You may see illness as a reflection of emotional and mental states, as well as physical ailments. Pain isn’t just a pain, it’s a teacher: illness is a message from your body. Because of this, you may be more inclined to pursue holistic medicine and treatments that take your entire body into account, instead of just addressing symptoms. Mixing modern and traditional medicine is a great way to heal yourself holistically.

      "title": "Scorpio Lilith is associated with taboo.",
      "content": "Scorpio Lilith is associated with taboo. Both Scorpio and Lilith have strong ties to taboo—subliminal rules that keep up the base standards in a community. If you have this placement, you probably have some interest in the occult, death, or sexual taboos—anything to help you discover the mysteries of your own existence. This can also manifest itself as an interest in secrets: both your own and others. Your intuition is so strong, you know where you want to find your wisdom. When you’re interested in something that seems good for you, pursue it wholeheartedly while leaving room in your life for healthy regulation (sleeping, eating, socializing, etc.)."

      "title": "You’re happiest with reliable, stable partners.",
      "content": "You’re happiest with reliable, stable partners. The transformative nature of this placement leads Scorpio Liliths to crave stability. Having relationships with responsible, good-hearted people allows them to have a space to lower their guard and let that wild, raw energy out. You may be afraid of entering a relationship due to a time you’ve been hurt (or hurt someone) in the past. Luckily, you easily learn from your mistakes . Once you know something to be true, you’ve already changed. This placement can make you hold onto things longer than they serve you. Listen to your body to know when a relationship has run its course. If being around someone hurts your stomach, tightens your chest, or makes you feel anxious, it might be time to let go."

      "title": "Scorpio Liliths want to lead a power couple.",
      "content": "Scorpio Liliths want to lead a power couple. Scorpio Liliths are intense and into power, so you likely want an intense, powerful partner. You’re most compatible with people who can keep up with you and create their own realities, but you may have trouble letting go of the upper hand. As you get more comfortable in a relationship, you’re likely to feel secure enough to share power. Discuss your wants and needs with your partner to help you gauge when you can luxuriate in control and when you can relax and let someone else take the reins."

      "title": "This placement can make it hard to communicate to your partner.",
      "content": "This placement can make it hard to communicate to your partner. Despite your natural powers of speech, you may clam up in your relationships. [4] X Research source Getting comfortable with your partner and allowing yourself to be vulnerable helps you learn how to express your feelings just as well as any other topic of expertise. Lilith is also the placement where your trauma is said to lie. [5] X Research source Because Scorpio is highly related to sex and sexuality, having a Scorpio Lilith can mean you have trauma around sex and relationships. If you’re having difficulty speaking to your partner, practice the conversation with someone you trust to find out exactly what you want to say. People with Taurus placements—Scorpio's sister sign, known for decadence and commitment to pleasure—can sometimes be easier for you to open up to. Their energy creates a space that’s very open to intimacy and can soothe your unease."

      "title": "You probably have strong opinions on sex.",
      "content": "You probably have strong opinions on sex. Love it or hate it, sex is a hot-button topic for you. You might be obsessed with sex or disgusted by it. You may feel some shame around sex, or be interested in kink or sadomasochism. Either way, sex may play a more extreme role in your life than in other people’s. Experiences you had as a child are likely to have cemented whatever view you have on sex now. Consider learning more about sex to become sexually empowered. When you’re safe, true to yourself, and curious, sex can be incredibly fulfilling and teach you about yourself and others."

      "title": "You can have intense, mercurial feelings for people.",
      "content": "You can have intense, mercurial feelings for people. If Lilith is highlighting what you need to heal (Scorpio), then you may look to your relationships for completion. You may want to spend all your time with someone, but then lose interest after the honeymoon stage is over. Conversely, if someone falls out of your favor, it may be hard for them to re-enter your life. Learning to forgive people frees up mental space you can use for self actualization."

      "title": "Black Moon Lilith is a mathematical point, not a celestial body.",
      "content": "Black Moon Lilith is a mathematical point, not a celestial body. Lilith is calculated by the apogee of the moon—the furthest point from the Earth in the moon’s rotation. [6] X Research source It’s also related to the dark side of the moon, which suggests that Lilith is somewhat the opposite of the moon sign. Looking at Lilith as the opposite of the moon, some believe that Lilith is a way to shatter what the moon represents—breaking down your need for stability, the state of your emotions, and your childhood history. There are actually three astrological Liliths, all referring to different things. Usually, if you hear Lilith, someone is referring to Black Moon Lilith. The other two are the asteroid Lilith and Dark Moon Lilith, a theorized, dusty ghost moon allegedly spotted since the 17th century. [7] X Research source Use a Black Moon Lilith calculator to find out your Lilith—most birth charts don’t include this placement."

      "title": "Black Moon Lilith is named for Lilith, a mythological fallen “first woman”.",
      "content": "Black Moon Lilith is named for Lilith, a mythological fallen “first woman”. In the Alphabet of Ben Sira (c. 700 CE), God made man and woman, Adam and Lilith, as equals. Lilith left paradise and lived in the desert after Adam tried to force her to submit to him. Adam tried to bring her back, but she refused to return and became a demon. [8] X Research source Lilith is seen as a symbol of both the Divine and Demonic Feminine. Her story represents sexual liberation and the refusal to be dominated, as well as the transformation one takes on away from society."
    },
    {
      "title": "Black Moon Lilith represents internal power and ostracization.",
      "content": "Black Moon Lilith represents internal power and ostracization. Lilith is the you that’s away from the group. It’s the power to keep yourself alive and free, the rejected parts of you, the dark parts of you—Black Moon Lilith represents where your conscious and subconscious meet, where your trauma acts, and your greatest powers for change lie. Lilith is often seen as a negative, vindictive placement, but it’s never that simple. Lilith is about the changes you go through to save yourself from your circumstances and have a better life."

      "title": "Scorpio is associated with mystery, the unconscious, and intensity.",
      "content": "Scorpio is associated with mystery, the unconscious, and intensity. Scorpio, personified, is a warrior philosopher. They search at the edges of society for the meaning of life with a holistic approach—life, death, science, magic, religion, the occult, taboos—they take in everything as they shape the sacred drive that keeps them fighting. While Scorpio can be seen as an aggressive sign, it’s usually more associated with the backend, behind-the-scenes aspects of conflict. This is what gives Scorpio Lilith its intense intellectual and spiritual power."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scorpio is a fixed water sign.",
      "content": "Scorpio is a fixed water sign. The water element is associated with emotions, intensity, and the unconscious, and the fixed mode is associated with persistence and determination. Together, these aspects form Scorpio, a glassy topped river with a strong undercurrent. Astrological signs all have “modality,” or a designation of the vibe they give off. The modes are Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable, which correlate with energy, strength, and change. When applied to Lilith, these aspects are what keep you dedicated to your path, morals, and relationships."

      "title": "Scorpio’s rulers, Pluto and Mars, are powerful and cunning.",
      "content": "Scorpio’s rulers, Pluto and Mars, are powerful and cunning. Mars (the planet of aggression and war) ruled Scorpio until the discovery of Pluto. While it may seem strange that the rulers were just changed, the addition makes sense. Pluto represents the unconscious desires that Mars brings to fruition through the fight. Mars is also the ruler of Aries, the cardinal (energetic) fire sign. While Scorpio is also war-like, its subversive, intellectual components align it more closely with the strategic elements of Pluto. [9] X Research source This makes you daring, good at starting things, and a strong leader."
