      "title": "Pour rubbing alcohol into a small bowl.",
      "content": "Pour rubbing alcohol into a small bowl. To start making your fireball from a cotton ball, first pour around ¼ cup (60 ml) of rubbing alcohol into a small bowl. Keep in mind that higher concentrations of rubbing alcohol make a larger and hotter flame, while lower concentrations make a flame that is not as hot but is easier to hold. [1] X Research source 70% rubbing alcohol is a high concentration. If you can’t find a lower concentration, dilute it to make a mixture that is one part water, 2 parts 70% rubbing alcohol."

      "title": "Soak a cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Soak a cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol. Place one cotton ball in the bowl of rubbing alcohol, turning it over to soak the entire ball in the liquid. Wear disposable gloves or kitchen gloves if you have them so that the rubbing alcohol does not get directly on your hands. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Squeeze out the cotton ball.",
      "content": "Squeeze out the cotton ball. After soaking the cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol, take the cotton ball out of the bowl and squeeze it to release excess alcohol. This ensures that the cotton ball won’t drip rubbing alcohol, which is dangerous when you set it the cotton ball on fire. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your hands.",
      "content": "Wash your hands. If you are handling the cotton ball with your bare hands, set the cotton ball down on a plate or counter. Wash you hands with soap and water and dry them to remove traces of rubbing alcohol. If your clothing got splashed by the rubbing alcohol, change any garments that have the alcohol on them as an extra safety precaution. [4] X Research source If you did use gloves to soak the cotton ball in the rubbing alcohol, take off the gloves, making sure not to transfer the rubbing alcohol to your hands. Your cotton ball is now ready to be set aflame!"

      "title": "Cut a shirt into a strip.",
      "content": "Cut a shirt into a strip. You can also make a fireball using a cotton shirt as a base, which will make a bigger flame. First, cut the cotton T-shirt into a 2 x 4.7 inch(5 x 12 cm) strip. [5] X Research source Make sure that you are using a T-shirt that is 100% cotton. If you use a shirt that is only partly cotton, it will melt instead of burn."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the strip of shirt into a ball.",
      "content": "Roll the strip of shirt into a ball. After you cut your strip, roll it to create a ball. Try not to roll it too tightly, or else the rubbing alcohol will have a hard time soaking into the fabric. Also try to tuck in any loose ends or edges to make a more regular ball. [6] X Research source Keep holding the cloth ball in your hand after rolling so that it doesn’t unravel."

    {
      "title": "Fasten the ball with thread.",
      "content": "Fasten the ball with thread. Thread a large, sharp needle with cotton string. Then insert the needle into the cloth ball, piercing it all the way through the ball from one side to the other. [7] X Research source Make sure that the string you are using is 100% cotton. Hold the ball while you pierce it with the needle to make sure it stays together."

    {
      "title": "Tie the string at both ends.",
      "content": "Tie the string at both ends. After you stitch through the cloth ball, tie the cotton string at both ends. Stitching through the ball helps the cloth ball to keep its shape. [8] X Research source Don’t break off the string, as you will keep using it."

      "content": "Place the cloth ball in a bowl of rubbing alcohol. Pour around ½ cup (125 ml) of rubbing alcohol into a bowl large enough to hold the cloth ball. Then take the cloth ball and place it in the rubbing alcohol, allowing it to soak for a few seconds. Use a spoon or other object to turn the ball over in the alcohol so that both sides absorb some of the rubbing alcohol. Do not get any rubbing alcohol on your hands or clothes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer the cloth ball to a clean bowl.",
      "content": "Transfer the cloth ball to a clean bowl. After you have soaked the cloth ball for about three seconds, use a pair of tongs or tweezers to transfer the ball out from the bowl with the alcohol to a new, clean bowl. Make the transfer after only a few seconds so that the cloth ball doesn’t soak for too long. If the ball absorbs too much rubbing alcohol, it will become soaked and start dripping. This can be dangerous when you light it on fire."

    {
      "title": "Wash your hands.",
      "content": "Wash your hands. Even if you are fairly certain you didn’t get any rubbing alcohol on your hands, it’s best to wash them before you ignite the fireball. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. If any rubbing alcohol splashed on your clothes, it’s very important to change into new clothes. Having rubbing alcohol on your clothes can cause your clothes to get set on fire."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a clear, safe space.",
      "content": "Find a clear, safe space. Don’t ignite your fireball in a cluttered space or around highly flammable objects like papers. Try to find an empty, neutral space like your driveway or inside a concrete garage. Set up a fire extinguisher as an extra safety precaution. Review how to use the fire extinguisher before lighting the fireball."

    {
      "title": "Hold the ball with a pair of tweezers or tongs.",
      "content": "Hold the ball with a pair of tweezers or tongs. It’s not a good idea to set fire to the ball when it is in your hands. Instead, pick it up using a pair of tweezers or tongs and hold it out in front of you. Clear the bowl of rubbing alcohol away, as it could be a fire hazard."

    {
      "title": "Ignite the ball with a fire source.",
      "content": "Ignite the ball with a fire source. Use a fire source, preferably a long reach lighter, to ignite the ball. The ball should immediately be consumed by flames and become a fireball!"

      "content": "Drop the fireball into your hand. After you light the fireball, you have the option of holding it by the tongs or tweezers, or holding it in your hand. If you decide you want to hold it, drop the fireball carefully into your palm, making sure not to drop it on the ground. If you do drop the fireball, you can try to scoop it up, or just stamp on it with your foot to put it out."

    {
      "title": "Shift the ball from hand to hand.",
      "content": "Shift the ball from hand to hand. Though it’s safe to handle the fireball, if you hold it in the same place in your hand, it will become very hot and may burn you. Instead of holding the fireball in the same spot, shift it between your left and right hand. [10] X Research source Hold your hands away from your body so that there is no risk of the fireball catching your clothes on fire. Remember not to panic. It’s safe to hold the fireball as long as you keep shifting it around and keep it away from your clothing."

      "title": "Put out the fireball.",
      "content": "Put out the fireball. Whenever you are done playing with the fireball, close your hand over it. This should cause the fireball to extinguish. Make sure that the fireball is completely extinguished by running water over it. Then dispose of the ball. [11] X Research source"
