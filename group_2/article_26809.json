    {
      "title": "Chop the banana.",
      "content": "Chop the banana. Select one medium, ripe banana, yellow or specked with brown. The stronger your blender, the less you have to chop: For a weak blender, chop the banana into small pieces, or mash it into a paste with a fork. For a strong blender, slice the bananas. For a food processor, break the banana into thirds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Freeze the banana (optional).",
      "content": "Freeze the banana (optional). If you have time, freeze the chopped banana to make a creamier, colder drink. Otherwise, just move on to the next step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Combine banana and ice in a blender.",
      "content": "Combine banana and ice in a blender. Add the banana to a blender. Pour in about ½–¾ cup (120–180mL) crushed ice. You can skip the ice if you're using a frozen banana, or if the weather is cool. Ice cubes will take much longer to blend, and may break a weak blender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour in milk, milk substitute, or water.",
      "content": "Pour in milk, milk substitute, or water. Pour milk or your favorite milk substitute into the blender until it reaches about ¾ the height of your solid ingredients. Even regular tap water will end up creamy after blending. If you prefer precise measurements, start with 2 cups (480mL) of liquid. After blending, add more in ½ cup (120mL) increments until you reach the desired consistency. You can use any type of milk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend until smooth.",
      "content": "Blend until smooth. Blend until all ingredients are combined and smooth. This will take 1–3 minutes, depending on the power of your blender. Blend in more liquid for a thinner drink. Blend in more ice for a thicker drink."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add sweetener (optional).",
      "content": "Add sweetener (optional). Most people enjoy adding a little sugar, honey, or another sweetener. Add a small spoonful, blend, and taste. Repeat until the drink is as sweet as you like it. If you are serving the banana milk to vegans, keep in mind that some vegans do not eat honey."

    {
      "title": "Serve.",
      "content": "Serve. Serve in a tall glass with a thick straw. You can also pour banana milk over cereal, porridge, or fruit."

      "title": "Make a dessert drink.",
      "content": "Make a dessert drink. Add any or all of the following to make a richer, sweeter drink: ½ tsp (1.25mL) vanilla extract for a more intense flavor A splash of cream for a richer taste A scoop of vanilla ice cream to make a banana milkshake A squeeze of chocolate syrup Several dates instead of sugar for a rich, natural sweetness"

    {
      "title": "Thicken the drink with oats.",
      "content": "Thicken the drink with oats. On the healthier side of the spectrum, a handful of raw oats creates a thicker, creamier texture."

      "content": "Combine with a healthy smoothie. If you enjoy green smoothies, combine the two ideas. The banana will keep the smoothie thick and creamy, while the leafy greens provide vitamins and nutrients."

      "title": "Chop up fresh fruit.",
      "content": "Chop up fresh fruit. Banana milk is basically a fruit smoothie already. Expand on the tropical theme with fresh mango, pineapple, or cantaloupe. Add more milk or a dollop of yogurt to keep it smooth."
