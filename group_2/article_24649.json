      "title": "Cut the lemon lengthwise.",
      "content": "Cut the lemon lengthwise. Cut the lemon in half, from tip to tip. This makes a more flexible lemon peel, easier to squeeze. [1] X Research source If you have a hinge-style hand juicer cut them crosswise instead for a better fit."

      "title": "Place a mesh strainer over a bowl.",
      "content": "Place a mesh strainer over a bowl. The mesh will catch the lemon seeds and pulp, letting the juice drain through."

      "title": "Squeeze with a pair of tongs.",
      "content": "Squeeze with a pair of tongs. Place a lemon half between the two arms of your kitchen tongs, near the prongs, and squeeze. This is fast, easy, and doesn't fill your kitchen drawer with a one-purpose tool."

      "title": "Scrape it out with a fork or spoon.",
      "content": "Scrape it out with a fork or spoon. This alternative requires even less specialized equipment. Hold the lemon half firmly with one hand, angling the lemon downward to avoid a squirt of juice in your face. Stick a fork or spoon in the pulp and rotate it around the lemon. Repeat until very little pulp remains. A fork will let you scrape out the last bits of pulp, getting more juice from each lemon. But if you're juicing a whole pile of lemons, pick the spoon for a faster job. If you only want a few drops of lemon juice to flavor a dish, just stick the fork in a whole lemon and squeeze. The rest of the lemon will stay good for much longer than a cut half. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a manual juicer.",
      "content": "Use a manual juicer. These cheap tools speed up the job a little and are a bit less messy. Find one made from wood, plastic, or enameled aluminum, since the bare metal will gradually corrode if exposed to citric acid. They come in three varieties: A hand juicer sits over your bowl, with a ridged knob sticking up. Press the lemon half down and rotate several times around the knob. Squeeze to the edge of the skin to get all the juice. A reamer has an identical knob, attached to a handle instead. Hold the lemon half in one hand and rotate the reamer around the lemon. A hinged squeezer is the fastest, but only when juicing lemons that fit nicely into your model. Cut off the knobby tip if present, then place your lemon half face-down in the cup. Hold over the bowl and press the other arm hard against the lemon, turning it inside out."

      "title": "Buy an electric citrus juicer for large quantities.",
      "content": "Buy an electric citrus juicer for large quantities. An all-purpose juicer will put a great deal of bitter pith in your juice, and its metal blades may corrode over time. Buy a specialized citrus juicer for better results. If using an all-purpose juicer, peel the lemon first or wash it thoroughly to remove trace pesticides. Many experts agree that hand-squeezed juice tastes better, possibly because an electric machine scrapes away too much pith, or fails to break out flavorful oils from the peel."

      "title": "Pick juicy lemons.",
      "content": "Pick juicy lemons. Smaller lemons have a higher percentage of juice, so select these if buying lemons by weight or juicing a large number. Avoid rough-skinned lemons, which may have shriveled and lost juice as they aged. [3] X Research source When shopping, heft two similarly-sized lemons, one in each hand. The heavier one has more juice. Meyer is the most common extra-juicy variety, but some areas will stock Fino, Primofiori, or Lapithkiotiki from the Mediterranean. Varieties low in juice include Femminello, Interdonato, and Verna. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Store lemons in the freezer.",
      "content": "Store lemons in the freezer. When plants freeze, their water expands into ice crystals and ruptures the cell walls. Once thawed in the microwave or a 15-minute cold water bath, all that water trapped inside those cells will be ready to add to your juice. [5] X Research source Wash and dry the lemons before freezing in an airtight container. Fresh lemons will retain quality for at least four weeks in the freezer."

    {
      "title": "Microwave the lemons before cutting.",
      "content": "Microwave the lemons before cutting. A warm lemon is easier to squeeze, and some say it even produces more juice. Zap the lemons for 10â€“20 seconds, or a few seconds more if frozen, until soft and slightly warm to the touch. This weakens the material that holds the juice, and causes the juice to flow more easily. [6] X Research source This works especially well on older lemons or lemon varieties with thick skins. [7] X Research source If the fruit is steaming, you've gone too far and boiled away some of the juice."
