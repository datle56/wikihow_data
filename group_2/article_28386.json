      "title": "Wash your hair regularly.",
      "content": "Wash your hair regularly. This may seem like an obvious solution, but it's key, particularly if you have oily hair. Oily hair tends to pick up environmental smells. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop smoking.",
      "content": "Stop smoking. Smoke can cling to your hair and linger there for a long time, and it's very hard to mask it. If you can't completely stop smoking, try to only smoke outside and never in enclosed areas like cars. If you live or work with people who smoke, do your best to stay away from them while they're smoking or encourage them to do it outside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover your hair in smelly environments.",
      "content": "Cover your hair in smelly environments. If you work in a kitchen or are going to be at a smoke-filled party, cover your hair if you can. [3] X Research source In a kitchen, wear a hairnet, kerchief, or a hat if the dress code permits. At a party, opt for a hat or a cute bandana. If you can't cover your hair, put it up in a bun, which will limit the amount of hair that is exposed to the smell."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your headgear and pillowcases.",
      "content": "Wash your headgear and pillowcases. Anything that comes in contact with your hair (hats, kerchiefs, helmets, scrunchies, headbands, and pillowcases) can pick up the smell of your hair when it's not clean and then transfer that smell back to you when you wear them on clean hair. Keep these items as clean as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean out your brush or comb.",
      "content": "Clean out your brush or comb. Especially if you use products that build up in your hair and on your brush, you could be forcing smells into your hair when you brush it. Try to clean them out about once a week. If there is so much hair in your brush that you can't pull it out with your hands, slide a pen or pencil under the hair in the brush and pull upward. You can also use scissors to get stubborn hair out of your brush, just be careful not to harm the bristles. Insert the scissors parallel to the rows of bristles. For an extra clean brush , fill up your sink with warm water and add about a tablespoon of shampoo. Wash your de-haired brush in the sink, rinse it well, and let it dry."

      "title": "Avoid sharing a brush with pets.",
      "content": "Avoid sharing a brush with pets. Zoophilic fungi grow on animals and can transfer themselves to humans. These fungi breed in warm, damp conditions, so even if you wash your hair, you may not be able to remove them. [4] X Research source Sometimes very close contact with pets can transfer zoophilic fungi to humans even if you don't share a brush. If you suspect that you have acquired a fungus from an animal, see a doctor. You may need both an anti-fungal pill and an anti-fungal shampoo."

      "title": "Use dry shampoo.",
      "content": "Use dry shampoo. Dry shampoo is designed to absorb oil and will help soak up smells as well. [5] X Expert Source Patrick Evan Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. Spray it liberally onto your hair before you come into contact with smells. Make sure that you spray it all over your hair. After you encounter the smells, brush your hair thoroughly to help release them from the hair."

      "title": "Spray perfume on your hair or brush.",
      "content": "Spray perfume on your hair or brush. You can buy a variety of perfumes designed especially for hair, and these are your best option. You can use regular perfume occasionally as well, but since it's not designed for hair, it can leave your hair oily or dry, so use it infrequently. Don't spray perfume not meant for hair directly on your hair. It might ruin your hairstyle, weigh down your hair, or leave a shiny looking spot. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use essential oils.",
      "content": "Use essential oils. Many are antimicrobial and can help you avoid scalp infections (which tend to lead to smelly hair). Tea tree oil, lavender oil, vanilla oil, and peppermint oil are all good options. Add 2-3 drops to a cup of water, and massage the mixture into your scalp. Leave it in for about twenty minutes before you shampoo your hair. [7] X Research source Alternatively, you can add essential oils to your shampoo. Use about two drops per ounce of shampoo."

      "title": "Try scented hairsprays, serums, and dry shampoos.",
      "content": "Try scented hairsprays, serums, and dry shampoos. Particularly if you already use hair products, add a delicious smelling one into your routine. Smells from these products won't necessarily last all day, so consider keeping small refresher bottles with you in a purse or bag. Some brands even make hair refreshing sprays. Salt water sprays also work well for this purpose and won't weigh down strands."

      "title": "Use a deep conditioner about once every two weeks.",
      "content": "Use a deep conditioner about once every two weeks. Deep conditioners are designed to keep your hair soft and prevent breakage, but they can also add delightful smells to your hair. Most brands recommend that you use them every couple of weeks, but check the directions to be sure. For an extra deep clean, warm up your conditioner before using it. Place the closed container in a sink full of hot water for about a minute before applying it to your hair. Alternate between a deep conditioner that is intended to moisturize (look for ingredients such as emollient butters and oils, glycerin, and aloe vera) and another that is intended to strengthen (look for hydrolyzed proteins, amino acids, keratin, and henna).

      "content": "Make your own shampoo. Many beauty experts believe that store bought shampoos strip the natural oil out of your hair. One advantage to making your own shampoo is that you can make it smell however you want! There are dozens of recipes out there, but here's one that doesn't call for too many hard-to-find ingredients. Mix together the following and use like regular shampoo: [9] X Research source 1/2 cup distilled water 1/4 cup liquid castile soap (soap made of plant oils) 2 teaspoons avocado oil 1/8 teaspoon peppermint essential oil 1/8 teaspoon tea tree essential oil 10-15 drops of the essential oil of your choice"

      "content": "Make a baking soda rinse. Baking soda can reduce the amount of oil in your hair and neutralize odors. [10] X Research source In a bowl or glass, mix 1/4 cup of baking soda and 3/4 cup of water. It will form a paste. (Double these amounts if your hair is past your shoulders.) Wet your hair, and apply the baking soda and water mixture. Leave it in for about five minutes, and then wash your hair with shampoo. Do this about once a week. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Use rose water. Apply rose water directly onto your hair. Massage the rose water into your scalp. Let it soak in for 20 minutes, then wash your hair as you normally would. The rose water will leave a lingering scent of roses. [12] X Research source Rose water can be drying, so use it sparingly."

      "title": "Make a rinse out of lemons.",
      "content": "Make a rinse out of lemons. Lemons are great for making your hair smell fresh, and they also fight dandruff. Shampoo your hair first. Squeeze two fresh lemons into 1 cup of water, and then massage the juice into your hair. Let it soak for up to ten minutes. Be sure to condition afterwards so that the juice doesn't dry your hair out. Lemon juice is astringent and may dry out your hair. Beware that lemon juice also tends to lighten your hair and bring out highlights, especially if you go out in the sun with it still in. You can also add an essential oil to the lemon-water mixture, but it's not necessary since lemons already have a very strong smell."
