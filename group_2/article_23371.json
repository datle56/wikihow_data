      "content": "Look for a large cat. Maine Coons are the largest of all cat breeds. They have a sturdy and rugged look about them. Some people have even likened them to small bobcats. If you have a cat that seems unusually large, it might be a Maine Coon. [4] X Research source Male Maine Coons tend to weight 15-25 pounds. Females tend to weigh 10-15 pounds. If your cat falls within these weight ranges, you just might have a Maine Coon. Males are usually 10-16 inches (25-41 centimeters) tall and 40 inches (101 centimeters) long. Females tend to be 8-14 inches tall and around 40 inches (101 centimeters) long. Use a yardstick or tape measure to obtain your cat’s length and height."

      "title": "Check the cat’s miscellaneous body characteristics.",
      "content": "Check the cat’s miscellaneous body characteristics. Maine Coons have muscular legs that are medium in length. The legs should be proportional to the body. The body must be long, not compact. Maine Coons have tails that are wide at the base, then narrow gradually. Try reaching the cat's shoulder with its tail. If you can reach or almost reach the shoulder, the tail is correct length to suggest it might be a Maine Coon. The tail should have long, flowing fur. Finally, look for tapered ears. The two ears of the Maine Coon are wide at the base and taper to a point. They will be positioned relatively close together, with no more than one ear’s width between them. [7] X Research source The ears will have tufts of fur growing inside them. Most of the European-type cats will also have lynx-like tufts of fur on the points of their ears. The cat will wrap its tail around itself to stay warm in cold weather. The tail is fluffy and quite long."

      "content": "Check for a love of water. Maine Coons enjoy splashing and spilling water. They’re even known to splash about in toilets. If your cat seems to have a special fascination with water, and it shows other signs of being a Maine Coon, it’s possible that it’s a Maine Coon. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a genetic test.",
      "content": "Get a genetic test. Another way to identify a Maine Coon is to get a genetic test. This involves a vet or other medical professional taking a DNA sample from your cat. Typically, this is done by swabbing the inside of your cat’s cheek for skin cells, drawing a vial of blood, or clipping a bit of its fur. The vet will then use this biological sample to compare your cat’s genome against known Maine Coon DNA and look for a match. Genetic tests are about 90% accurate."

      "title": "Monitor the cat’s health.",
      "content": "Monitor the cat’s health. Maine Coons typically have good health. However, they are susceptible to two conditions. One is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition that causes the walls of the heart to thicken. The other condition is feline hip dysplasia, which is caused when Maine Coons’ hips don’t form properly and results in pain and arthritis. [13] X Research source The breeder you obtain your Maine Coon from should screen for HCM before you purchase it. Because Maine Coons are naturally large, there is little you can do to prevent hip dysplasia. Your vet will help you treat your cat should it develop this condition."

      "content": "Decide if a cat is right for you. Like all cats, Maine Coons are an investment of both time and money. They can cost anywhere from $400 to $1,000, and they also require ongoing costs like cat food, cat litter, and vet visits. Plus, since Maine Coons are relatively outgoing, they require some attention and affection every day. If you are a busy person, consider a pet that requires less energy. [14] X Research source If you want a less energetic Maine Coon, think about getting a full-grown cat instead of a kitten."

      "content": "Choose a reputable breeder. Reputable breeders will not have Maine Coons (or any other breed) available year-round. They will also not accept purchases online or have multiple litters on their premises. Instead, they’ll insist on a strict contract that describes what happens in case you can no longer take care of the cat, and provide as much information as possible about the cat’s pedigree and health.

      "title": "Visit the cat before you buy it.",
      "content": "Visit the cat before you buy it. Reputable breeders or cat sellers will welcome you to visit the cat in the location where the cat was raised. The cat should be raised indoors. Be wary of breeders who try to meet you in a location that is not the place where the Maine Coon was raised (typically the breeder’s home). [17] X Research source If you see that the Maine Coon was raised in a small, dirty, or crowded pen, choose another breeder. These conditions suggest that the cat might have fleas or illnesses. Likewise, do not obtain a cat that was raised in isolation, as it may have difficulty socializing with other pets or people when introduced to your home."

      "content": "Be patient. Maine Coons will probably not be available right away. Cats raised properly need to be about 12 to 16 weeks old before they can be separated from their mothers. Additionally, many breeders have wait lists that prevent quick and easy purchase of a Maine Coon. [18] X Research source"
