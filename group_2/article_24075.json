[1] X Research source Depending on your security settings, you might also get a warning if you didn’t download the app from the App Store, even if Apple can verify the developer. If you’ve set your Mac to allow software that doesn’t come from the App Store, you’ll simply get a pop-up stating that the app was downloaded from the Internet and asking if you want to open it anyway. If this happens, just click Open to proceed. If you don’t allow apps that aren’t from the App Store, you can change that in your settings. Go to Apple menu > System Settings > Privacy & Security and check the radio button next to App Store and identified developers under the Security header. Enter your admin username and password if prompted."
