Twist the wire around the top of the pliers to form a loop, then pull the pliers out. Use the plies to squeeze the loop smaller, if needed. This will hold the beads in place and prevent them from sliding off the end of the wire."

      "content": "Thread your beads onto the wire, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) tail. You can use different shapes, sizes, and colors of beads, or just one type for something simple. You can even use a different type of bead on each coil. Don't cover the entire wire with beads. Leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) tail at the end.. Small beads, such as bicorns and seed beads work great for memory wire bracelets. Avoid using any large, chunky beads, especially towards the end, as they might slide past the loops."

Slip a charm onto the jump ring, then place the ring where you want it on the bracelet. Use the needle-nose pliers to close the ring. Great places to put charms include at either end of the bracelet, or in the middle between two beads."

Do not use your good, jewelry wire cutters for this, or they may get ruined. Use a sturdy pair of hardware pliers instead. For a thicker bracelet, cut 12 coils."

You will need to twist the cap in order to get it all the way on. Repeat for the other end of the bracelet. The tape should be covered completely by the cap, so you should not have to remove it. The recommended size is 6mm. If you are using a different sized cord, however, then make sure that you get caps that match that cord. For example, if your cord is 4mm, then get 4mm caps. If you'd like to add charms to your caps, get the kind that have loops on the end. You can use any color your want, but silver will look best with black leather; brass will look best with brown leather."
