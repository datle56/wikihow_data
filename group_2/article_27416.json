In general, you will need 3 tablespoons of oil for every 1/3 cup of dry kernels. If you're making 1 cup of dried kernels, for example, you will need 9 tablespoons of your oil. [1] X Research source"

Let the oil sit on the stove until it's hot enough to cook your popcorn. [2] X Research source Make sure to watch the oil the whole time. You do not want to leave a pot on the stove unattended."

As soon as they pop, the oil is ready and you can add the rest of your kernels. [3] X Research source Measure out your kernels before you place the oil over the heat. You need to transfer them quickly as soon as the oil heats up."

Resist the temptation to lift the lid and peak, as this can cause your kernels to heat unevenly. [4] X Research source If you like to watch the popcorn pop, you can use a clear lid. This may eliminate some of the temptation to peak."

In general, it should not take more than 20 or 30 seconds. Listen to the pot. You should hear a lot of popping noises. Once these noises slow to a few seconds between pops, your popcorn is ready. [5] X Research source Carefully remove the lid. Make sure to use your oven mitts, as the lid will be hot. Stand back a little in case any popcorn flies out of the pan. It will be hot and can hurt your skin."

      "content": "Add melted butter and salt. Melted butter is a classic popcorn topping. How much melted butter you want to add is up to you. Usually, a few tablespoons should be sufficient. Too much butter can make the popcorn soggy, however, and it also adds calories. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source If you melt butter over the stove, do not melt it on high heat. This can burn the butter. Butter should be melted slowly, over medium or low heat. You can also melt butter in the microwave if you cut it into sections first. Cover the butter with a paper towel and only heat it for 10 to 15 seconds at a time. When adding butter to your popcorn, it's a good idea to pour the butter around the edge of the bowl. This way, the butter will disperse more evenly throughout the popcorn. Sprinkle some salt over the popcorn and taste. If you feel it still needs more flavor, you can add a bit more salt."

      "content": "Try brown butter for a sweeter taste. Brown butter can add a sweet, nutty flavor to your popcorn. You'll end up with something like kettle corn. Brown butter is butter that is heated until it gains a brownish color. [14] X Research source Place your desired amount of butter in a pan with a light-colored bottom. You want the bottom of the pan to be a light color so you can monitor the butter's color. Watch the butter as it heats. When the butter begins to foam slightly, it will turn a lemon color, then a golden color, and then a brown. Remove the butter as soon as it turns brown to avoid burning it. Let the butter cool for a few minutes and then add it to your popcorn."

      "content": "Add nutritional yeast for cheesy popcorn. A cheesy flavor for your popcorn can be nice, but cheese powders are full of additives and cheese itself has a lot of calories. To preserve the health benefits of homemade popcorn, try adding nutritional yeast instead of cheese-based products. Sprinkle nutritional yeast over your popcorn, tasting as you go until you reach your desired flavor. Nutritional yeast can be somewhat hard to find. It may be in the health food section of your supermarket. However, not every supermarket carries nutritional yeast. You may want to call ahead of time and check. If you can't find nutritional yeast at a conventional supermarket, health food stores like Whole Foods usually carry nutritional yeast."

[15] X Research source Melt your butter over medium heat. Add the sugar and mix until it's moist. Turn the heat up to medium high and heat the mixture until it starts to boil. Allow it to boil for 3 to 4 minutes as you stir. Remove the mixture from the heat and add the remaining ingredients until the mixture is thick and frothy.
