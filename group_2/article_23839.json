Start by folding over the bottom of your pants twice. [1] X Research source Make sure that the area you fold over is wide enough for your elastic to fit into. Hold your elastic up against it to be sure."

      "content": "Sew along the edge of the hem. Next, sew along the edge of the hem to secure the casing. Make sure to leave a small gap in the opening that you can insert the elastic into when you are done. [2] X Research source If you are inserting elastic into a pair of pants that has already been completed and has a wide enough hem to fit elastic into, then you will need to cut a small hole into the inside of the hem. Use a pair of scissors to snip a small slit across the inner layer of the hem and use this opening to insert your elastic into.

      "title": "Attach a safety pin to the elastic.",
      "content": "Attach a safety pin to the elastic. When your casing is complete, attach a safety pin to the end of the elastic strip and secure it. Attaching a safety pin to the end of the elastic strip will provide an anchor for your elastic and make it easier to work it through your pant legs. [4] X Research source Make sure that you attach the safety pin far enough away from the end of the elastic so that it will not slip out. You may even want to insert the pin through a couple of places in the elastic to be certain that it is secure."

      "content": "Work the elastic into the hem. To work the elastic into the hem, insert the closed safety pin into the opening in your pant leg hem.

      "title": "Measure the elastic around your ankle.",
      "content": "Measure the elastic around your ankle. To determine how much elastic to insert into your pant leg, try measuring the elastic around your ankle or around the ankle of the person who will wear the pants. This will help to ensure that your elastic pant leg hem will be a good fit. Wrap the elastic around the ankle without stretching it and then cut it about an inch past the area where the two ends meet. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that you do not want to make your elastic bands too tight or too loose. Aim for a comfortable fit."

      "content": "Use the right size safety pin. Using a larger safety pin may make your work go faster, but you cannot always use a large safety pin. The size of your casing will determine what size safety pin you can use. If you have wide casing, then you can go with a larger safety pin. If you have a small casing, then go with a small safety pin."

      "title": "Keep the safety pin secured.",
      "content": "Keep the safety pin secured. Make sure that the safety pin does not open while you are working it through the casing. If it does, try to fasten it again without snagging the fabric. If you cannot get it fastened again, then pull the elastic out and start over."
