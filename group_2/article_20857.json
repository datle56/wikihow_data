      "content": "Fill the bath a few inches deep. Fill a safe, clean receptacle with roughly three inches of warm water. The water should be between 90 °F (32 °C) and 100 °F (38 °C). Once you have the appropriate amount of water, shut it off and swirl the water to ensure there are no especially hot spots. [2] X Research source Touch the water with the inside of your wrist. The sensitivity of your wrist is a more trustworthy temperature indicator than your hand. The water should feel warm, not hot. Never add water to the tub with your baby in it. The water can quickly become dangerously hot. You may want to set your water heater to 120 °F (49 °C). This will still allow you to get hot water, but will prevent potentially scalding water from collecting in the water heater."
