      "content": "Babies are often ready to hold bottles at 6 months old. Most babies won’t be ready to hold a bottle on their own until they’re at least 6 months old, which is the same age they start eating solid foods and holding sippy cups. If your baby is younger than 6 months, wait until they’re a little older. Some babies don’t develop this skill until a little later, like at 10 to 12 months, which is perfectly normal and okay. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that all babies are different, and they develop skills at their own pace. Allow your baby to take the lead and do what they’re ready to do."

      "content": "Guide your baby’s hands to the sides of the bottle while you hold them. Hold your baby as you normally would for a feeding and hold out the bottle for them—at a downward angle, so the nub is full of milk. [2] X Research source If your baby doesn’t reach out for the bottle on their own, gently place one or both of their hands on the sides of the bottle to show them how to grasp it. Then, guide the bottle towards your baby’s mouth and feed them as usual. If your baby doesn’t want to hold onto the bottle, don’t force them. They may not be ready for self-feeding. Holding your baby is the best way to encourage them to hold their bottle since they will still get to enjoy snuggling with you."

      "content": "Start with a partially full bottle to get them used to the weight. A full bottle might be too much for your baby to hold on their own, especially if they have progressed to 6 fl oz (180 mL) or more per feeding. Fill a bottle halfway and offer it to your baby to see if they can support the weight. As always, prepare a clean, sterile bottle for your baby. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Make sure to refill the bottle as needed to give your baby their usual amount of breast milk or formula. Also, wet the outside of the nub with a little milk to encourage your baby to put their mouth on it."

      "content": "Support the weight of the bottle while your baby holds it. Your baby might need your help while they’re getting the hang of holding their own bottle. Gently support the bottle with your own hand as they grasp it. As with regular feeding, make sure the bottle stays slightly tilted to prevent your child from swallowing air bubbles."

      "title": "Continue to cuddle your baby during and after feedings.",
      "content": "Continue to cuddle your baby during and after feedings. Don’t stop holding your baby once they can feed themselves with their bottle. Even if your baby has mastered holding their own bottle, it’s important to continue to hold them and cuddle them regularly for their emotional well-being. Make eye contact with and speak softly to your baby to bond with and soothe them. Parenting specialist Denise Stern recommends \"holding your baby upright for at least 20 minutes or longer after feeding them (up to 45 minutes).\" You'll get in more bonding time with your baby, and this also gives gravity a chance to release any trapped air your baby swallowed while feeding."

      "content": "They can sit upright on their own. In order to bottle feed safely and independently, your baby must be able to sit up while they hold the bottle. This skill is usually mastered at around 6-8 months old. [5] X Research source Babies should never lie down flat while feeding themselves."

      "title": "They can grasp objects in 1 hand.",
      "content": "They can grasp objects in 1 hand. These motor skills may indicate that your baby is capable of holding their bottle. If your baby is not yet doing these things, then they probably won’t be ready to hold their own bottle. Keep in mind this stage may come later—commonly at 9 months old. [6] X Research source Your baby may also transfer objects from one hand to the other if they’re ready to hold their own bottle."

      "content": "They’re interested in the bottle and can pick it up. Babies can be uninterested in their bottles for a number of reasons, like lack of visual appeal or stimulation while feeding. [7] X Research source If your baby is uninterested in holding their own bottle, then they might not be ready for self-feeding. But if your baby picks up the bottle and brings it to their mouth, then they may be ready to try self-feeding. Leave the bottle empty or fill it only part way to avoid having a mess in your child’s play area."

If you’re unsure about your baby’s development or have any concerns at all about your baby’s motor skills, make an appointment with your baby’s pediatrician. [9] X Research source They can evaluate your baby to see if they are developing normally, and also tell you if letting you baby hold their own bottle is a good idea for your circumstances. For example, if your baby is not grasping objects at 6 months, then you might consult with your child’s pediatrician to ensure that everything is okay."

      "content": "Supervise your baby's feedings even if they can self-feed. No matter how confident you are in your baby’s ability to self-feed, it’s still important to supervise them during feedings. Stay in the same room as your baby and ensure that you can see and hear them. This way you will notice if your baby falls asleep and begins to choke or if they need your help."

      "title": "Avoid propping the bottle up to your baby’s mouth.",
      "content": "Avoid propping the bottle up to your baby’s mouth. “Prop feeding” is when you use an object to keep a bottle in a baby’s mouth so they might feed without you. It may be tempting if your baby doesn’t hold their own bottle, but it’s incredibly dangerous and may lead to choking, ear infection, and tooth rot. If you’re fatigued and can’t feed your baby, enlist a friend or family member to help."

[11] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source For example, hold your baby in your arms and keep them angled so that their head is above their stomach. Or, place your baby into a high chair or their stroller with the seat in the upright or inclined position."

      "content": "Switch to a pacifier at bedtime to prevent tooth decay. Breast milk or formula can pool around your baby’s teeth and lead to cavities at a very young age if your baby feeds until they fall asleep. To prevent this, switch to a pacifier before your baby has drifted off completely. Your baby can suck on the pacifier as they’re falling asleep and continue to suck on it while they sleep as well. As an added bonus, giving your baby a pacifier at bedtime reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). [12] X Research source"

Self-feeding with a bottle is not a mandatory milestone, and babies develop motor skills at their own pace.

Experts recommend starting the transition at 6 months of age, which is around the time your baby is also learning to hold their own bottle. Once they get the hang of holding a bottle, introduce a sippy cup with a spouted lid or a straw. Start by putting a little formula, breast milk or water in the cup and offering it at one meal per day.
