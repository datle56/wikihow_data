      "content": "“Ice in my veins” means you're “cold-blooded” or “calm under pressure.” In the sports world, “ice in my veins” is used to describe skillful players who don’t fold under pressure, especially during the last few minutes of a match that could make or break the game. It’s often associated with basketball, thanks to Los Angeles Lakers player D’Angelo Russell, who began pointing to the veins in his forearms as a celebratory pose back in 2016. [1] X Research source The expression “ice in my veins” (or sometimes “ice water in my veins”) was a little-known English idiom until it was popularized by Russell."

      "content": "Extend one arm downward, then point at the veins on your extended arm. Keep your extended arm straight and relaxed, and position your hand so it’s flat and your palm is facing outward. With the opposite hand, use your index and middle fingers to gesture toward the veins on the inside of your arm. Throw out a cool and confident expression, like a wink or lip bite, to enhance the effect and look extra cold-blooded. If you want to dap someone up like LeBron and D-Lo , slap your friend's right hand with your right hand, then slap the back of their right hand with the back of your right hand. Wrap your thumb around the crook of their thumb, gently squeeze, then let go and flash the ice in my veins pose."
