      "content": "Dealerships may offer loaner cars for extended repairs and recalls. These cars are also called “courtesy cars,” and are often available when you face a considerable wait time while the repair is completed. In these situations, the dealership may offer you a loaner car to make up for the inconvenience of the repair. Though most recall repairs only take a few hours, your dealership might still offer the service.

Consult your policy or get on the phone with a representative to see if you’re covered. Sometimes, your insurance will require you to get a loaner from an approved dealership or garage, so it can be helpful to know which dealerships qualify before you take your car in for service.

      "content": "Ask a representative at the dealership or garage for a loaner. Since courtesy car policies vary from location to location, the best way to find out if you qualify for one is just to ask! Many dealerships and some garages offer loaner vehicles as a complimentary service as long as you can show them a driver’s license and proof of insurance. Your car’s warranty may also entitle you to a courtesy car in the case of repairs. [4] X Research source Be persistent with your dealership. Some dealerships may be reluctant to offer you a courtesy car. In this case, it can be useful to keep asking or to voice your complaints. [5] X Research source It’s also useful to know the details of your warranty or insurance policy to use as leverage. If you find yourself at a dead-end with a representative, it can help to ask to speak to a dealership manager or owner. These employees have a greater interest in keeping your business, and may be more willing to help you. [6] X Research source"

If you’re of-age, have active car insurance, and identifying documents like a driver’s license or passport, your dealership may offer you a loaner. In this case, read over the loaner car paperwork carefully and take note of or ask questions about when you need to return it, if you need to refill the gas, who is authorized to drive it Return the loaner car on time. Loaners aren’t forever. Dealerships will only let you drive the courtesy vehicle for the duration of the repairs, and sometimes for even shorter spans. [7] X Research source Before you drive off the lot to go complete those errands, ask the service desk how long you can keep the car, and be sure to have it back when they ask."

In the case of an accident in which you’re not at-fault, many insurance plans cover the cost of a courtesy car while your own car is in for repairs. If you were at fault in the accident, however, it’s less likely your insurance will cover it. Many comprehensive car insurance policies also entitle you to a loaner car in the event of an accident.

Call ahead to ensure availability, and shop around to make sure you get the best price. Then, pick up and drop off the rental at the designated times. [15] X Research source You may need to pick it up before you drop your own car off for repairs. The cost of a rental car is also covered in many insurance policies in the event of repairs on your own vehicle. Check your policy to see if you’re covered. Of course, you can also shell out the money from your own pocket if you’re not covered but you need the car anyway."

Hire cars work much like rentals, but the cost of the rental is billed to whomever was decided as at-fault by the insurance company once the claim is filed. Just be aware that if they find you at fault for the accident at the end of their investigation, you may be the one who ends up with the bill. [16] X Research source"
