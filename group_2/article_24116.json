A web app, also known as a progressive web app (PWA), is an app that is created using the same software and technology that a developer might use to create any website or browser-based app. However, these apps are designed so you can install and run them on your device just like an app that you can install from the App Store. [4] X Research source Since these apps are installable on your device, that means you can run them even if your iPhone or iPad is offline. They can also interface with your operating system and other apps on your device. While web apps function almost like regular apps, they are somewhat more limited. They can’t store as much offline data as native apps, and they don’t integrate as seamlessly with other iOS features. They also can’t access all of your device’s hardware, such as Bluetooth and Face ID or Touch ID."

Some developers prefer to offer web apps as an easier and more convenient alternative to creating an Apple-approved native app. If you can’t find an app for your favorite website, business, or online service, check their website to see if they offer a web app instead."
