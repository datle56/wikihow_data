While your right foot is forward and your left foot is back, quickly shift your weight to your left foot and bounce on it lightly. Then shift your weight back to your right foot again and lift your left foot up from the ground. [3] X Research source During this step, your weight starts and ends on your right foot. The follow bounces back on their right foot and then shifts their weight to their left foot. [4] X Research source This is called the rock step."

[5] X Research source Make sure to bounce lightly as you step to keep the dance looking fun and smooth! The follow steps forward with their right foot.

Then quickly place your whole right foot on the ground and shift your weight into it, before repeating the movement with your left foot. Aim to “walk” in place on the spot for 2 steps. [8] X Research source You’ll end the “walk” back on your left foot, just like how you started. The follow steps onto their left foot and then back to their right foot to “walk”.

      "content": "Repeat this sequence to dance at a single-time framework. When you combine each of these movements, you are doing an entry-level Lindy Hop dance! Start slowly and work your way through each weight shift and foot change. Then combine each movement and get plenty of practice to learn the sequence in no time. You can speed up as your confidence grows. [12] X Research source The single-time framework is the easiest way to start learning basic Lindy Hop moves."

Keep your left leg slightly bent as you swing it. Bounce lightly on your right foot while you swing your left leg forward so that it looks like you’re hopping on your right leg. [14] X Research source Kick your right foot forward if you’re the follow. This is where the double-time framework becomes different from the single-time framework. The double-time framework is made up of the same steps, but it involves kicking and swinging your legs to dance at a faster pace."

[16] X Research source If you’re the follow, “walk” by shifting your weight to your left leg and then back to your right.

Then lift your left leg from the ground in front of you in a “kicking back” motion. [17] X Research source If you’re the follow, kick your left leg back and raise your right leg from the ground."

Practice the stepping back, kicking forward, bouncing, walking, and kicking back sequence until you feel confident. Once you reach the end of the sequence, you can repeat it again by stepping back with your left foot and keeping your weight in your right foot.

Practice as much as you can to learn the steps and to feel your confidence grow. If you want to see your progress, try dancing in front of a mirror or recording yourself as you practice. [19] X Research source If you don’t have a partner to dance with but you would like one, join your local swing dancing club to find someone else who needs a partner too."

The steps and positions for Lindy Hop moves tend to be the same for both the lead and the follow, however, they are simply performed in the opposite way. If the lead steps with the right foot, then the follow steps with the left foot and vice versa. This also means that if the lead steps back, the follow steps forward towards the lead. [20] X Research source The mirrored nature of the dance moves makes the Lindy Hop easier to learn from an experienced lead! Anyone can be the lead or the follow. Although the lead is often a man, there are no formal requirements to follow traditional gender stereotypes when dancing the Lindy Hop. [21] X Research source"

There are many different ways to dance the Lindy Hop with a partner, including next to each other in a side-by-side formation or with the lead in front and the follow behind. However, all that’s important for beginner dancers is to remember to move together. Stick close by your partner whether you are holding hands or you have your arms resting on each other's backs. [22] X Research source Try to remain flexible with your movements so that you and your partner look like you are dancing together instead of individually. This also helps your dancing to look more fluid."
