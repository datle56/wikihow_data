      "title": "Boil the water.",
      "content": "Boil the water. Bring 1 cup (250 ml) of purified water to a boil using a tea kettle or small saucepan."

      "title": "Rinse the parsley leaves.",
      "content": "Rinse the parsley leaves. Rinse 1/4 cup (60 ml) of fresh parsley leaves under cool, running water. Pat the leaves dry using clean paper towels. Use either curly or flat leaf parsley. Both varieties should have similar tastes and health benefits. Either roughly chop the parsley or leave it whole. Chopping or gently crushing the parsley in your hand can help release some of its natural oils, so it may result in stronger tea."
    },
    {
      "title": "Steep the parsley for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Steep the parsley for 5 to 10 minutes. Place the parsley leaves in the bottom of one teacup. Pour the hot water over the leaves, then allow the tea to steep for 5 to 10 minutes. Alter the steep time according to personal taste. Parsley tea can seem very bitter, and the flavor becomes stronger as you steep it longer."

      "title": "Steep the parsley for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Steep the parsley for 5 to 10 minutes. Measure out 2 tsp (10 ml) of dried parsley leaves. Place the leaves in the bottom of a teacup, pour the boiling water on top, and steep the leaves for 5 to 10 minutes. Parsley tea can have a bitter taste. Steep it for 5 minutes if you're sensitive to bitterness. If you enjoy strong teas or plan to sweeten it, steep the parsley for up to 10 minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strain the leaves.",
      "content": "Strain the leaves. Pass the contents of the teacup through a tea strainer. Collect the liquid tea in a second teacup placed beneath the strainer and discard the caught parsley leaves."

      "title": "Enjoy.",
      "content": "Enjoy. Sweeten the tea, if desired it, or drink the parsley tea without any sweetener. Either way, you should enjoy it while it's still hot. Use your favorite sweetener, or consider trying a bit of raw cane sugar or locally sourced honey."

      "title": "Boil the water.",
      "content": "Boil the water. Fill a small saucepan or tea kettle with 1 cup (250 ml) of purified water. Set the pan on the stove and bring the water to a steady boil."

      "title": "Chop the parsley root.",
      "content": "Chop the parsley root. Rinse the parsley root under cool, running water, then use a sharp kitchen knife to roughly chop 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of parsley root. While you can technically use the roots of leaf parsley, it's more common to use Hamburg root parsley, a separate cultivar with a much thicker root that resembles a white carrot. If the parsley root appears dirty, rinse it under cool, running water and scrub away as much dirt as possible. You can also peel the root, but doing so isn't usually necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Steep the parsley root for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Steep the parsley root for 10 minutes. Place the chopped parsley root in the bottom of one teacup. Pour the water into the same cup, then steep the tea for about 10 minutes. The taste of parsley root tea is somewhat milder when compared to parsley leaf tea, so it's usually best to wait the full 10 minutes to allow the flavor to develop. You can adjust this time to your personal tastes, however."

      "title": "Strain the solid pieces.",
      "content": "Strain the solid pieces. Pour the contents of the teacup through a fine mesh strainer, catching the pieces of chopped parsley root inside. Collect the liquid tea in a separate teacup."

Pour the boiling water over the seeds, then allow the tea to steep for about 5 minutes. Parsley seeds can be slightly more bitter than parsley leaves, so the steep time is usually restricted to 5 minutes. You can increase this time if you prefer very strong tea, however."
