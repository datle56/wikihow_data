      "content": "Steep corn kernels repeatedly in warm water. Place 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of untreated kernel corn in a burlap sack and place that burlap sack in a larger bucket or container. Then, saturate the burlap sack with warm water. Make sure the corn is completely and evenly soaked. Let the kernels steep for 9 hours, then remove them from the water and place them in a well-ventilated area to dry for 3 hours. Repeat this steeping/resting process 3 more times. Why sprout the corn for whiskey? In short, sprouting eliminates the need for added sugar in the mash, allowing you to get a more authentic whiskey. Also called \"malting,\" sprouting causes enzymes in the corn to convert starches to sugar. [1] X Research source Those sugars then become the building blocks of the alcohol in the whiskey."

      "content": "Let the kernel corn sprout in an aluminum tray for 2-3 days. Pour the kernels into aluminum trays , leaving about an inch of room at the top. Keep the trays in a warm, dark environment, such as a well-insulated garage or basement. Make sure the corn remains damp for about a week and a half. During the sprouting phase, keep the temperature of the corn at about 77 °F (25 °C). Rinse the corn with cool water about every 12 hours during this process to keep it damp and maintain its temperature."

      "content": "Dehydrate and malt the corn in an oven for 7-8 hours. Once the corn sprouts are a couple inches in length, you can use a dehydrator or an oven set to about 125 °F (52 °C) for several hours to stop the corn’s germinating. Then, increase the temperature to 160 °F (71 °C) for another hour to complete the dehydration. Finally cook the corn at 185 °F (85 °C) for four hours. At this stage, your corn should be shriveled and dry."

      "title": "Remove the sprouted ends from the corn.",
      "content": "Remove the sprouted ends from the corn. After the corn is malted in the oven, remove and discard as many of the sprouted roots as possible by hand. Reserve the corn in an air-tight container until you’re ready to ferment. To remove the stems, you can also place the malted corn in a tied pillowcase, then run the pillow case through the dryer on the lowest-possible heat. After, place the mixture in a clean tray and separate the kernels from the stems."

      "title": "Crush the kernels.",
      "content": "Crush the kernels. Using a rolling pin with a solid end, a wooden muddler, or any other large implement, crush the kernels on a clean, flat surface. Stop when all the kernels have been broken apart. [2] X Research source If you want to, you can also use a grist mill to crack apart the corn. You can only do this, however, when your corn is fully dried; wet corn won't go through the grist mill properly."

      "content": "Combine the corn with 5 gallons (19 l) of boiling water and 2 pounds (32 oz) of malted barley. In the fermenter , allow the mash to cool down to 152 °F (67 °C), stirring every 5 minutes. Then add the malted barley and stir for one minute. Finally, let the mixture rest for about 1.5 hours. You want the mash to cool down but still be considerably warm for the yeast to do its job. You're now ready to ferment. [3] X Research source At this point, the corn will take on a slightly gelatinous consistency, due to the starches releasing from the kernels. During this phase of the whiskey making, it's especially important to keep all the instruments and containers you'll be using clean. A small contamination could ruin the entire batch of whiskey. Be sure to sterilize any thermometers, container lids, and airlocks you might be using, as well as sanitize your hands beforehand."

      "content": "Vent your fermenter with an airlock. Attach your airlock to your fermenter’s valve, and fill it halfway with water to create a seal. An airlock is an essential tool for fermentation. It allows the CO 2 to escape but no air to get into the mash. Air getting into mash would minimize the effect that yeast otherwise has. [5] X Research source You can make an airlock yourself quite easily, but buying one is cheap. It's possible to get one for under a couple of bucks."

      "content": "Allow the mash to ferment for 7-10 days at room temperature. The fermentation process can vary by a few days depending on your corn and yeast varieties and the temperature of the room. During this process, yeast converts the sugars in the corn to alcohol. [6] X Research source Use a hydrometer to tell when the primary fermentation is complete. If the reading on the hydrometer is the same for two to three consecutive days, you're ready to begin distillation. [7] X Research source"

Strain the mixture through a pillowcase into the still . Try to keep as much of the solids as possible away from the still when transferring the mash. The resulting liquid is called a “wash,” and will be distilled into whiskey! If your mixture is still producing bubbles, let it sit for another 2-3 days in order to complete fermentation. At this point, the wash has about 15% alcohol by volume. Distilling the wash will increase the alcohol content greatly. For best results, get a pot still. If you're especially handy and have the time, you can build a still yourself ."

With whiskeys, you don't want to rush the distillation; heat up the still on medium-heat stove or burner plate over the course of 30 minutes to an hour until it just begins to boil. Heating the wash too quickly will result in burnt wash and off flavors. [8] X Research source . Why this temperature? Your wash contains methanol and ethanol, which can be lethal to consume. Luckily, these compounds boil and evaporate at about 174 °F (79 °C), so heating the mixture to above that point will boil them off. But keep the mixture just above that temperature and not much higher, to avoid boiling off the liquid."

In order to get it resembling something like you'd find at the store, you need to age the whiskey and dilute it down to 40% - 50% ABV. You want to know how strong your moonshine is, both for aging and as an indication of how well your distillation went. [13] X Research source Be sure not to confuse the proof and tralle readings on the hydrometer. Your proof will always be two times the amount of the tralle."

Aging will make the whiskey smoother and give it its distinctive taste. Whiskey will only age in barrels. When it is bottled, whiskey will stop aging. Age and store the whiskey anywhere from a few weeks to several years, based on your preference. Longer aging produces richer flavor. [14] X Research source Whiskey is generally aged in oak barrels. The barrels can be carefully charred or toasted first, or can be sourced from another distiller that's kept another spirit in the barrel for added flavor. If you want to add oak flavor to your moonshine but don't want to have to spring for a barrel, you can also add toasted oak chips to your whiskey. Toast your oak chips over low heat (200º F) in the oven for an hour, until they are aromatic but not yet charred. Remove and cool. Transfer to a sterilized glass bottle and steep for 5 - 15 days or longer, depending on your tastes. Strain the whiskey through cheesecloth or a clean pillowcase to catch all the wood chips."

At this point, the whiskey is still probably 60% - 80% ABV, which would make for a fiery, uncomfortable drinking experience. It should be diluted to around 40% or 45% ABV for a much more pleasant drinking experience. Pour water into your whiskey, and experiment with ratios to find the perfect mixture for your taste.

[16] X Research source Or, drink it straight to really appreciate your hard work. Always drink responsibly. Congrats! What you’ve just made is actually considered bourbon, a variety of whiskey made with at least 51% corn mash. Or at least, it’ll be bourbon so long as you age it in a charred oak barrel and bottle it at 40% ABV, and don’t add anything to it during fermenting and distilling. There are plenty of other varieties of whiskey, like scotch (a barley malt distilled in Scotland), rye whiskey, Irish whiskey (a grain malt originated by Irish monks), and even Japanese whiskey. [17] X Research source Experiment with the grains you use for your malt and the barrels you use to age your whiskey in order to achieve different flavors and varieties."
