Hopefully the squeaking has ceased! When you're inserting your orthotic, be sure to seat the heel as far back in the shoe as possible. If you're using a full-length orthotic, take out the insole that's in the shoe. If it's a three-quarter length orthotic, put it on top of or underneath the current insole [2] X Expert Source Mark Co, DPM Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020."
