      "content": "Seed potatoes from a garden store are best, but grocery store potatoes may work. The best way to grow potatoes is from potatoes, but not just any potato will do: they have to be specially-grown seed potatoes from a garden supply store (potatoes that aren’t treated to prevent sprouting). [1] X Research source Regular potatoes from a grocery store are often treated with pesticides which can spread disease through your whole crop and anti-sprouting chemicals to keep them fresh, so either order your seeding potatoes from a catalog or hit the garden store. [2] X Research source Seed potatoes come in every variation—russet, Yukon, fingerling, you name it. Your garden supply store will have options for you to choose from, and they can order you any type of potato they don’t already have in the store. Some grocery store potatoes may eventually sprout and be plantable, but you’ll often have to wait several weeks after purchase for this to happen. Note that sprouted sweet potatoes can’t be used for growing as easily as other potatoes. Sprouted sections need to grow roots in water for several weeks first. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Plant potatoes in late spring as soon as the soil warms above 45 °F (7 °C). The exact timing for this depends on the climate where you live. If you live somewhere with cold winters (like Minnesota), this might be in early April, whereas if you live somewhere warm or temperature year-round (like Georgia), it could be as early as February. [4] X Research source Potatoes grow best when the soil is above 45°F (7°C) and daytime temperatures are consistently 65–80°F (18–27°C). [5] X Research source Expert gardeners recommend planting potatoes around the time of last expected frost, but that time can vary based on where you live."

      "content": "Choose a spot in your yard or garden that gets 6–8 hours of sun a day. Potatoes grow best with 8 hours of sunlight a day, but they don’t do well with too much heat. Pick a spot in your garden where the plants will be exposed to sunlight but not baking in the heat. They prefer summer temperatures of roughly 70 °F (21 °C), but can handle hotter temperatures as long as they’re not exposed to direct sunlight for more than 6–8 hours a day. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Plant potatoes in loose, loamy soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.0.",
      "content": "Plant potatoes in loose, loamy soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.0. Potatoes are hardy and can grow in a wide variety of soils, but they do best in sandy, loamy soil or loose soil that has good drainage. They prefer slightly acidic soil (around pH 6.0)—anything higher and your odds of developing potato scab disease. [7] X Research source To test the pH of your soil, contact an Extension office at your nearest university to perform the test, or do it yourself with a pH test strip , digital meter , or soil testing kit . If your soil is super sandy, you’ll probably have to water your potatoes more frequently to keep the soil adequately moist. If it’s very fine or high in silts and clays, the drainage may be poor and cause poorly shaped potatoes. Do not plant potatoes in soil that has been treated with lime or manure within the same growing season since this can also increase the risk of potato scab disease. To increase soil drainage, spade, aerate, or till the soil to break up clumps and incorporate organic matter like compost. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Let sprouts grow on your seed potatoes for 1 week before planting.",
      "content": "Let sprouts grow on your seed potatoes for 1 week before planting. Unlike most grocery store potatoes, seed potatoes grow little protuberances called sprouts. These sprouts, once planted, form the buds of new potato plants—they are essential to the growing process! Place your seed potatoes in any warm, dry spot (a bowl on your kitchen counter where the sun shines will do) and leave them for about a week. [9] X Research source One week is ample time for your sprouts to grow between 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) and 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) in length. That means they’re almost ready to be planted."

      "content": "Cut the potatoes into 2 in (5 cm) pieces and dry them for 2–3 days. Tiny potatoes (under 3 oz or 85 g) are fine to be planted whole, but any spud larger than a golf ball should be cut into chunks about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, each with at least 1–2 sprouts. [10] X Research source Usually just cutting the potatoes in halves or quarters will do. Then, return the cut potatoes to the warm spot where they’ve been sitting for the past week, and leave them an additional 2-3 days before planting. This allows the cuts to cure and become hardier once planted. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Loosen the soil and prep it with compost or a balanced fertilizer. Using a garden fork, rake compost or a 12‐12‐12 (N‐P‐K) fertilizer into your chosen plant-site and work out any clumps until the dirt is airy and breathable. If you’re using fertilizer, work in about 1 pound (454 g) of it for every 25 feet (7.6 m) of row. [12] X Research source Top your fertilizer or compost with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of soil or it could damage your potato roots. [13] X Research source If you don’t have compost or fertilizer, try substituting superphosphate or bonemeal, all available at the garden supply store. A balanced fertilizer can help improve the pH of your soil and make it more suitable for potatoes."

      "content": "Give your potatoes 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) of water per week. Potatoes prefer their soil moist, but not waterlogged. A good rule of thumb is to wait until the top 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) of soil is dry, then give your potatoes a good soak. You should generally give your potatoes 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) of water per week, including rainfall. [15] X Research source Aim for closer to 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week unless you live in a drier climate or have sandy soil. Then, 2 inches (5 cm) per week may be better."

      "content": "Hill the potatoes after 5 weeks when plants are 8–12 in (20–30 cm) high. To “hill” your potatoes , pile soil up around the stems to create a 1 foot (0.30 m) incline on either side. This will force new potatoes to grow above previously-planted ones. [16] X Research source You can cover the entire plant with soil, or choose to leave the leaves exposed (this may be helpful later, as their changing color can signal the potatoes’ growth). [17] X Research source Continue hilling about once a week as the plants grow taller. It will protect baby potatoes from being exposed to direct sunlight and provide dark, damp growing conditions for all your tubers."

      "content": "Let seed potatoes sprout for 1 week, then cut them into small pieces. Just like if you’re planting outdoors, allow your seed potatoes to sprout before planting. If they’re small (about the size of a golf ball), you can plant them whole. If they’re larger, cut them into pieces about 2 in (5.1 cm) big, making sure there are 1–2 sprouts per piece. [18] X Research source Let any cut pieces dry and cure for 2–3 days to let the exposed potato flesh toughen up and become more resistant to rot."

The bigger the pot, the better (potatoes need lots of room to grow), but at a minimum it should be 10 US gal (38 L) for 4–6 seed potatoes. If you plan to grow more than 6 seed potatoes, go for a barrel-sized pot. [19] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source When pot planting potatoes, you’ll also need to contain a sizable drainage hole. Black reusable plastic pots from the garden store work well for growing potatoes, as the black color holds in warmth and the bottoms have built-in drainage."

Once planted, cover them with 6 in (15 cm) of potting soil. Water until the liquid begins to drain from the bottom. Leave the pot in a sunny, temperate spot on your front or back deck where it will be exposed to 6–8 hours of sunlight per day. [20] X Research source Don’t overcrowd the pot. 6 in (15 cm) is the minimum amount of space in which your potato can still grow."

The dryness of the soil will depend on the weather where you live, so test if it’s time to water by sticking one finger into the top of the soil. If it feels dry, it’s time to water again. Keep going until water begins to drain from the bottom of the pot. [21] X Research source If you live in a hotter climate, your soil will get drier quicker and will need to be watered more often. Check twice a day."

      "content": "Harvest your potatoes after 70-100 days when the leaves turn yellow. Somewhere around five months after their plant date, your potatoes will begin to show signs that they’ve matured. The leaves will turn yellow and the foliage will die back, meaning it’s almost time to harvest them. Leave them in the soil for an additional 2–3 weeks, then carefully dig them up with a pitchfork or spade and gather them with your hands. [23] X Research source Many species of potatoes will grow into tubers large enough to eat after 10 weeks, but leaving them in the ground longer will yield the largest crop. Check the skin of each potato for white, mushy spots—these could signify fungus, in which case the potatoes are not safe to eat. They should be uniform in color with tight, firm skins."

Instead, just knock off the loose dirt and store them in a cool (50–60°F or 10–15°C) area with high humidity for 10–14 days. This helps heal over any cuts or wounds that might be on the potatoes and dries out the skins for long term storage. [24] X Research source Store potatoes for 6–8 months in a cool, moist place like a basement. Keep them in a ventilated bag or box away from light sources (light causes potatoes to turn green, which makes them toxic to eat)."
