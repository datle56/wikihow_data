      "content": "Find a plain, white paper plate. A plate with pictures on it may look pretty, but you won't be able to see the numbers. Don't worry, you can color the plate later. [2] X Research source If you can't find a plain paper plate, use a regular plate to trace a circle onto a piece of paper. Cut the circle out and use it instead."

      "title": "Write the numbers 1 to 12 around the rim of the plate.",
      "content": "Write the numbers 1 to 12 around the rim of the plate. If you have a very narrow rim, then write the numbers on the plate itself. [3] X Research source Try to make the spaces between the numbers as even as you can. It might also be a good idea to write the numbers with a pencil first. You can draw over the numbers with crayon or marker later. Try to write the 12, 3, 6, and 9 first. This may help you keep things even. You can also use foam or sticker numbers instead of writing them out."

      "content": "Draw a two arrows on a piece of colored paper and cut them out. One arrow should be a little shower than the other one. Make sure that the bigger arrow can reach the numbers. [4] X Research source The big arrow will be the minute hand, and the small hand will be the hour hand."

[5] X Research source You can add stickers or even glitter to it. Try not to put too much on it, or you will not see the numbers. If you used paint or glitter glue, you will need to let everything dry before moving on."

To find the center, flip the plate over so the back is facing you. Draw a huge X across the back of the clock. Make sure that the points of the X are touching the edges of the clock. The center of the X is the center of the clock."

Tie the two ends into a knot to keep them together. Turn the clock over so that you can see the back. Put a drop of hot glue close to the top. Press the ribbon down onto it and let it dry. Glue guns can get very hot. Ask an adult to help you with this step. You can also staple the ribbon to the plate instead."

Wait for the glue to dry, then poke a hole near the top of the rectangle. Turn the clock over so that the back is facing you, and open up the brad. Slip the prongs through the hole in the rectangle, then flatten them again. Turn your clock back over and swing the pendulum."

Cut a wave-like shape around the edges of the brown paper, and pin it to your wall. Your clock will look like a grandfather clock! Consider combining this with the swinging pendulum."

[8] X Research source You can also try using a silver or gold permanent marker. Consider using the Roman numbers instead: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Start at the 1 o'clock position with the \"I\" and continue around the rim. The XII should be at the top of the clock, where the 12 would be."
