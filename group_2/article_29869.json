      "content": "Choose your colors. You can use random colors, or you can try to pick colors that complement one another. Consider what you want your bracelet to represent. For example, you can choose your favorite colors, the colors of your favorite sports team, or seasonal colors (e.g. orange, black, and purple for Halloween). Consider buying a rainbow loom kit if you plan to make a lot of bracelets. These kits feature bands in a variety of colors. You can buy a kit online or in an arts-and-crafts store for as little as $10. Try writing down the order of the colors so that you don't forget. For example, if you have chosen to use red, blue, and green bands, assign a number to each color: red (1), blue (2), green (3). If your design is more complex, it is even more important that you plan out the specific color order."

      "title": "Repeat these steps until you reach your desired length.",
      "content": "Repeat these steps until you reach your desired length. You just need to loop a new band onto your index and middle finger—above the previous band—then pull the previous band over the new band, your index fingertip, and your middle fingertip. Be sure to refer to your color order so that you don't make any mistakes. If you are making a bracelet for yourself, consider measuring your wrist—and then the bracelet—to make sure that your new accessory will fit. Hold a string tight around your wrist (as tight as you want the bracelet to fit) and then measure the length of the string. Your bracelet is done when it's as long as the string. If you are making a bracelet for someone else, think about how their wrist size compares to yours. If they have bigger wrists, make the bracelet slightly longer than you would for yourself. If they have smaller wrists, make the bracelet slightly shorter."

To finish the bracelet, attach the S-clip or C-clip to the free end of the chain in the loop that is right at the bottom. If you want to add more length to your chain, start at the top peg again and link bands into your desired length. Instead of adding another loose or triple band when you reach the bottom peg, simply hook the original chain (where the S-clip or C-clip hangs) to the last peg."
