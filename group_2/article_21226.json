      "content": "Get cardamom seeds from a grocery or agricultural supply store. Although you can collect cardamom seeds from capsules that you've purchased from the grocery store, it's best to buy cardamom seeds from an agricultural supply company. These seeds will be free from disease and are more likely to thrive.

      "content": "Fill containers with loamy soil. The soil should be slightly sandy so it drains gradually. You can purchase loamy soil from most garden centers. If you're planning on transplanting the seedlings to your outside garden, you can use any size container. If you're going to leave the seeds in the container and grow the plants to maturity, use a pot that's at least 1 foot (0.30 m) deep and 6 inches (15 cm) wide. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Plant the seeds 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) deep. Push a few of the seeds into the containers and cover each with 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) of soil. Water the seeds so the soil is completely moist. [3] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Start as many cardamom seeds as you like, but plant them about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart in the container so you can thin and transplant them once they start growing."

      "title": "Grow the cardamom until it sprouts a few leaves.",
      "content": "Grow the cardamom until it sprouts a few leaves. The cardamom should germinate after about 30 to 45 days. This means you should see the cardamom plants begin to poke up through the soil. Continue to water so the soil stays moist and leave the seedlings in the container until you see at least 2 leaves on the seedlings.

      "content": "Choose a space in the garden with well-draining soil. Pay attention to the soil after a heavy rain to see how it drains. You shouldn't see deep puddles remain, but the soil should stay moist. If the soil is too rich in clay, it will kill the cardamom plant, so find somewhere else in the garden or mix sand into the soil to break up the clay. [5] X Research source The ideal soil for cardamom is loamy with a pH level between 4.5 and 7."

      "title": "Pick a space with partial shade.",
      "content": "Pick a space with partial shade. Cardamom plants will die if they're in direct sunlight, so choose a planting area that has partial shade. If you only have a space that is completely shaded, it will work, but the plant may not grow as quickly. Cardamom plants usually grow under the canopy of trees that are above it.

      "title": "Select a planting area that has high humidity.",
      "content": "Select a planting area that has high humidity. Since cardamom grows in subtropical forests, it needs high humidity to thrive in your garden. To plant the cardamom outside, the humidity needs to be around 75%. Cardamom also prefers temperatures between 64 °F (18 °C) and 95 °F (35 °C)."

      "content": "Plant the cardamom seedlings 1– 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (2.5–3.8 cm) deep. Dig 1 in (2.5 cm) deep holes that are 6 to 18 inches (15 to 46 cm) apart. Place 1 seedling into each hole and surround the seedling roots with dirt. If you'd like to support the plants as they grow, drive a garden stake into the soil 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the base of each plant. [7] X Research source As the cardamom grows, you can tie the plant to the stake. Avoid planting seeds too deep since they may not sprout if they don’t get adequate sun."

      "content": "Plant the cardamom in a container if you want to move it. If you live in a climate with temperatures that occasionally dip below 60 °F (16 °C), you may want to plant the seedlings in large pots instead of outside in the garden. This will allow you to bring the cardamom in when it gets cool. [8] X Research source If you use a pot, choose as large of a pot as you can for your space that's also easy to pick up so you can move it in and out of your house. If you do need to bring the cardamom inside your house, consider placing it in the warmest, most humid room of your house, such as the bathroom."

      "content": "Water the plants to keep the soil moist. Feel the soil with your fingers every day to ensure that the soil is most. Since the soil should never dry out, water until the soil is soaked. [9] X Research source The cardamom plants will need even more water during the summer when they're growing the fruit. Plan on watering more during these months."

Spread it in the soil around the cardamom plants 2 times a month during the summer growing season. [10] X Research source To add nutrients back to the soil, you'll also need to spread aged manure or compost once a year."

      "content": "Grow the plants until they're 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3.0 m) high. Continue to water the plants regularly and fertilize them as needed. The plants will begin to grow tall, narrow stalks that reach high off of the ground. [11] X Research source Keep in mind that it will take a few years for the plants to put on a lot of growth. The stalks will grow rows of bright green leaves that are about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long."

      "content": "Dry the cardamom capsules. Depending on how many capsules you want to dry, you can use a variety of drying methods. For small-scale drying, spread the cardamom in a single layer and allow the sun to dry the capsules. Larger, commercial harvests often dry cardamom using extremely hot kilns.
