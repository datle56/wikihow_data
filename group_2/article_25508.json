      "title": "Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side closest to the flagpole.",
      "content": "Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side closest to the flagpole. The white stripes on the Union Jack are not all the same size. The wider white stripes on the side closest to the flagpole should sit on top of the diagonal red stripes. The white stripes represent Scotland’s Saint Andrew’s Cross while the red ones represent Ireland’s Saint Patrick’s Cross. [3] X Research source A good mnemonic device to use is \"wide white top.\" [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side furthest from the flagpole.",
      "content": "Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side furthest from the flagpole. On the side furthest from the flagpole, the white stripes that run diagonally should be thinner on the top of the red stripe, and thicker below the red stripe. This applies to both white stripes on the side furthest from the flagpole. Saint Andrew's Cross was on the flag first and takes precedence over Saint Patrick's cross."

      "title": "Ensure the thick white line is on the top left, if hung vertically.",
      "content": "Ensure the thick white line is on the top left, if hung vertically. When hanging your flag vertically, the thick white stripe should be on the top of all the other stripes on the top left hand side of your flag. The top edge of the flag should become the left edge of the flag when hanging it vertically. [5] X Research source This practice is similar to hanging the American flag, but varies in other countries like Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Slovenia, where they have different designs for flags hung vertically.

      "title": "Fly the flag upside down for a distress signal.",
      "content": "Fly the flag upside down for a distress signal. Flying the Union Jack upside down is a coded distress signal, and should only be used as such. In the UK, flying the flag upside down may be considered an insult, even if it was an honest mistake. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Assume the pole is on the left if it’s a graphic flag.",
      "content": "Assume the pole is on the left if it’s a graphic flag. When drawing the flag or putting up a graphic of the flag with no pole, assume the pole is on the left side of the flag. This means that the thick white stripes should lay over the red stripes on the left side of the flag."

      "title": "Drape the top left of the flag over the top left of the shoulder, when draping it on a coffin.",
      "content": "Drape the top left of the flag over the top left of the shoulder, when draping it on a coffin. When draping the flag over a coffin for a funeral service, make sure that the top left of the Union Jack be laid over the top left corner of the coffin. This is the traditional way to drape the flag for military funerals. Before cremating or burying the body, the flag should be removed and folded. [8] X Research source It is improper to use the flag as drapage for seat covers or tablecloths, or as a cover for boxes, barriers, or art during an unveiling ceremony. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear the flag backwards when it's on the right shoulder of a uniform.",
      "content": "Wear the flag backwards when it's on the right shoulder of a uniform. If your patch of the flag is on the left shoulder, you should wear the flag as it would normally look. However, on the right shoulder, the flag should be flipped backwards. This is similar to American Military Uniforms which require the flag to be reverse."
