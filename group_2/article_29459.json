      "content": "Ignoring them will tell them they have no control over you. After your relationship ends, your ex probably expects you to talk to them every day or beg for their attention. You can get under their skin by ignoring their calls and not responding to their texts. The longer you ignore them, the more they’ll get worried that they’ve lost you for good. [2] X Research source If they call or text you incessantly, feel free to block their number."

      "content": "Show off how happy you are online to throw it in your ex’s face. Many people use social media as a way to seek approval. [3] X Research source If you know your ex is constantly online, you can use that to your advantage. Whenever you’re hanging with friends or out on an adventure, post some pics to your social media accounts to let your ex know that you’re out there having fun without them. Some self-absorbed people expect you to be too sad to live your life after a breakup. If you show your ex that you’re ambivalent about it, you can really get under their skin."

      "content": "Hang out with others to show your ex you don’t need them anymore. If your ex tried to isolate you or keep you away from your friends at all, they’ll be crushed when you reconnect with your social circle. Spend time with your loved ones and have fun to show your ex that you can exist happily without them.

      "content": "Some insecure people feel threatened when they see other people’s happiness. If you really want to make your ex squirm, go out and date other people. You can keep things casual if you aren’t ready for a serious relationship right now, but be prepared for your ex to come running back. [5] X Research source If your ex is super self-absorbed, they’ll want you to be as obsessed with them as they are with themselves. By dating someone else, you’re showing them that you can move on."

      "content": "Make them think that they’ve lost you for good. If there’s one thing controlling people can’t stand, it’s losing their hold over a person. If you both made the decision to break things off, let your ex know that you’re not going to reverse that decision just because they regret it now. [6] X Research source “We’re not in a relationship anymore, remember? You’ll have to ask someone else for help.” “Sorry, I’m really busy. Plus, we aren’t dating anymore.”"

      "content": "If your ex loves to get under your skin, so don’t let them. Your ex might insult you or spread rumors about you in an attempt to belittle you. If you make contact with your ex again, the best way to get them to stop that behavior is to stay calm, and not show them any emotion. This can be tough to do, so try taking some deep breaths and counting to 10 every time you feel like you might have an emotional reaction. [7] X Research source Another great way to stay calm is by using the gray rock method . This method involves giving uninteresting, neutral responses that are about as interesting as a “gray rock,” like, “Uh-huh,” or, “Okay.” [8] X Research source"

If you were in a relationship with a controlling, manipulative person, they’re probably used to walking all over you. Show them that you won't allow that anymore by setting firm boundaries and sticking to them.

People with big, fragile egos often try to make those around them feel “less than.” When you stop looking for their approval, they’re going to worry that they’ve lost their hold over you for good.

It might seem counterintuitive to compliment the ex you’re trying to make jealous, but for someone with a huge ego who lives on praise, it’s a great way to show them what they’re missing.
