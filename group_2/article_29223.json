      "content": "Prepare black beans. If you are using beans from a can, then simply measure out 1/2 cup and pour into a blender. However, if you are using dry beans, be sure to cook them and drain the excess water. You can cook beans in a crock pot or on the stove. When the beans are ready, add them to your blender. Cooking beans in a crockpot is an easy way to prepare beans without soaking them beforehand. Simply rinse beans, pour into crockpot, add 6 cups of water for every pound of beans, and set crockpot on high for four to six hours. Once the beans are cooked, drain excess water and they'll be ready to go! [3] X Research source It may seem weird to add beans to a shake, but they are similar to spinach in that when mixed with other ingredients they don't have a taste -- they just add a sneaky bit of nutrition!"
