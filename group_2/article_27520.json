      "content": "Cut two equal lengths of material. You can cut them as long as you'd like, but bear in mind that with thick craft lace about 3 feet (1 m) of craft lace will yield about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of lanyard. Thinner gimp and boondoggle laces will yield more length in the final product. Using two different colors will be easier at first while you're learning the crown sinnet method."

      "content": "Fold up two loops with the bottom strand. Holding one finger down on the center for the entire first stitch so that the two strands stay where they are, use your other hand to grab one end of the bottom strand. Draw it up over the center, creating a large loop. Grab the other end of the bottom strand and do the same thing. Do not cross the strands as you draw up the loops; just make sure they both loop over the finger that's holding down the center."

If you're using a thread-based material, such as craft lace, simply cut the ends close to the lanyard and burn them with a match or secure them with crazy glue. If you're using gimp or boondoggle material, you'll need to do a finishing \"stitch.\" Loosen the loops of your last stitch a bit first. Then take one of your strands and pull it through the loop of the other strand of the same color, going under the same-color strand as well as the different-colored strand beneath it. Finally, pull your strand up through the center of the lanyard. Repeat this for all four strands, pulling each strand tight when they're all through, and then trim the strands to your desired length."
