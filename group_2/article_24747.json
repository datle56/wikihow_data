      "content": "Wrap fresh pieces of cauliflower with a damp paper towel. Soak a clean rag or paper towel in cool water and wring it out. Once your towel is no longer dripping wet, place it on the surface of your produce. Try wrapping the towel around the entire cauliflower, as this will keep it moist and fresh. [1] X Research source Make sure that rag or paper towel is only damp. If you don’t wrap your cauliflower up, it can dry out in storage."

      "title": "Place the wrapped produce in a perforated plastic bag.",
      "content": "Place the wrapped produce in a perforated plastic bag. Open a special produce bag or other perforated bag that’s large enough to hold your cauliflower. Fit the produce comfortably into the bag, and press out any excess air. Check that the top of the bag is securely sealed before moving it to the refrigerator. [2] X Research source Since you’re using a perforated bag, it’s not a big deal if the produce bag isn’t fully sealed. If you don’t have a perforated bag on hand, use a pair of scissors to cut small holes into a regular storage bag."

      "content": "Arrange the cauliflower in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator. Pull out the bottom crisper drawer of your refrigerator and check that there’s enough space for your produce. [3] X Research source Don’t place any other fruits and vegetables near the cauliflower, as this can affect the overall freshness of your produce. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Don’t overstuff your crisper drawer with food, as your cauliflower could end up getting squashed."

      "title": "Cook or eat the produce within 4-7 days.",
      "content": "Cook or eat the produce within 4-7 days. Take a mental note of when you place the cauliflower in the refrigerator. Try to cook with or eat the vegetable in the next few days, or else the produce might lose its freshness. If you leave the cauliflower in the refrigerator longer than 1 week, it might not taste as good. [5] X Research source Brown spots are a normal occurrence on fresh cauliflower. It doesn’t mean that the produce is rotten—it just means that your plant is low in boron. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) of boiling water into a large bowl or basin. Fill a large container with a large amount of hot water. Aim to use about 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, or enough to completely submerge your produce. If you’re only preserving a small amount of fresh cauliflower, you can use a little less water.

      "content": "Dissolve 4 tsp (23 g) of salt into the water. Try to use about 4 tsp (23 g) for each 1 gallon (3.8 L) that you’ve poured. After pouring in the salt, stir the water to ensure that the salt is completely dissolved. [8] X Research source The salt helps keep your cauliflower fresh in the freezer."

      "content": "Soak the cauliflower into the saltwater solution for 3 minutes. Clean and blanch the produce thoroughly by submerging it in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of salty water. Leave the cauliflower in the water for a few minutes, so the produce can last longer in storage. Once the vegetable has soaked, drain the pot over the sink to get rid of any excess water. [9] X Research source Use oven mitts or hot pads whenever you try handling containers of hot water."

      "content": "Cut or split the cauliflower into 1 in (2.5 cm) chunks. Use a large knife to chop your cauliflower into smaller pieces. Aim for the chunks to be equal in size, so they’re easier to package and store. If the vegetable pieces are too big, you might not be able to store them properly. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Arrange the cauliflower pieces in freezer-safe containers. Place the chunks into a plastic container or bag. Before you store the produce, check the labels on the container to ensure that they’re freezer-safe. Try to push out any extra air from the bag or container, so the cauliflower can stay as fresh as possible. [11] X Research source If you’re using a bag, check that the seal is tight and secure. Not all containers are freezer-safe. Check the bottom of your reusable storage boxes to see if they’re safe for long-term use in the freezer."

      "content": "Label the cauliflower and use it within 1 year. Take a label or piece of masking tape and write down the current date. Secure this label to your container of cauliflower, so you can keep track of its freshness. Ideally, try to eat or cook with your produce between 8 and 12 months so it doesn’t taste dry and freezer-burned. [12] X Research source While your cauliflower will still be safe to eat after that time, it won’t taste fresh. Try to keep your container of cauliflower in a place where you won’t forget about."

      "content": "Add your frozen cauliflower directly to different dishes. Avoid defrosting the vegetable pieces on your countertop, as this can make them taste less fresh. Instead, try adding the frozen chunks to your recipes. Keep the extra water content in mind when adding frozen cauliflower as an ingredient, as it might make your recipes more watery. [13] X Research source This works best when adding cauliflower to stews and soups."
