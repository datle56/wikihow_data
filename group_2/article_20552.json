Can we talk soon?” When you tell him that you want him back, try saying, “I’ve given it a lot of thought and I’d love to give our relationship another shot. What do you think?” Being honest will also help when you talk about your past relationship and what may have gone wrong, which you'll have to do before you get back together.

      "content": "Taurus men hold grudges, so they need sincere apologies to forgive. You may not have been the reason for the breakup, but if you did make a mistake, then you’ll need to offer him an apology before the two of you get back together. More than that, acknowledge his feelings and show him you understand why he’s upset; a Taurus man will only come back if you can admit your mistakes too. For example, if you said something hurtful, a good apology would be: “I wasn’t thinking when I said that, and I wish I had been more thoughtful. I know I hurt your feelings, and I’m sorry.” Taurus men are stubborn, but they always strive to make peace with the people around them. [5] X Research source If he can see your sincerity, he’ll likely accept your apology. A Taurus man will also admire your bravery in admitting your mistake. He’s willing to compromise and make amends, but only with someone who will meet him halfway. Taurus men don’t always forgive right away, but that doesn’t mean your apology will go unnoticed, explains Garbis. Give him time to think things over after you apologize, and he’ll likely come around in the end! [6] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021."
