      "title": "There’s nothing a Sag woman likes less than someone being disingenuous.",
      "content": "There’s nothing a Sag woman likes less than someone being disingenuous. If you put on a front or pretend to be someone you’re not, your Sagittarius is going to spot it right away. As you two get to know each other more, let her get to know the real you, and don’t bother with putting on a front. She’ll appreciate your openness, and you two will get even closer than you already were. In return, she’ll let you see the real her."

      "title": "Sagittarius signs love people who walk on the wild side.",
      "content": "Sagittarius signs love people who walk on the wild side. Don’t be afraid to let your freak flag fly! Tell her all about your weird hobby, your quirky habits, and your strange thoughts. She’ll love that you can match her energy, and she’ll want to learn even more about you. Plus, telling her about your weirder habits shows that you aren’t afraid to take risks (something that Sagittarius signs are drawn to)."

      "title": "Sagittariuses are naturally funny, and they’ll appreciate it if you are, too.",
      "content": "Sagittariuses are naturally funny, and they’ll appreciate it if you are, too. If you’re a funny person, don’t be afraid to show that off when you two are together. Crack jokes, make her laugh, and overall, have fun! Your goofy energy will draw her in even closer, and she’ll fall in love with you even more. If you don’t live super close to each other, send her silly jokes over text or DM her memes on Instagram. Use technology to show just how funny you can be, even when you’re not together in person."

      "title": "Fire signs tend to appreciate small pleasures.",
      "content": "Fire signs tend to appreciate small pleasures. Things like cozying up together on the couch during a storm or watching the sunset will make a Sagittarius swoon. Be sure to point these things out to her, and don’t be afraid to stop and smell the roses (literally). [1] X Research source You could also point out things like spotting a cute dog, holding hands while you walk together, eating a delicious dessert, or laughing at something silly until you cry."

      "title": "You’ll never be able to guess where a Sag is headed next.",
      "content": "You’ll never be able to guess where a Sag is headed next. These signs tend to always be plotting their next move, and they might make snap decisions that take them across the globe. If you want to be with a Sagittarius woman long-term, you might have to go along with some wild plans—but that’s half the fun of loving a fire sign like this. [2] X Research source Many Sagittarius signs have trouble holding down traditional jobs. Don’t be surprised to find out that your Sag woman has decided to get into a gig job or start her own side hustle one day."

      "title": "Sagittarius signs dream big, and they aren’t afraid to show it.",
      "content": "Sagittarius signs dream big, and they aren’t afraid to show it. Try to show her your support, and tell her you believe that she can do anything. This will make her feel loved, and your relationship will blossom because of it. [3] X Research source Even if it’s something that seems unattainable, let her figure that out on her own. Sagittarius signs love to try everything once, so she’ll back off once she realizes it’s not realistic."

      "title": "Although Sagittariuses talk a lot, they keep their emotions hidden.",
      "content": "Although Sagittariuses talk a lot, they keep their emotions hidden. Don’t be surprised if she takes a little while to open up her true self to you. Try not to pressure her, and be open with her first as encouragement. If your relationship goes well, she’ll feel more comfortable with you, and she’ll let you in on her true emotions over time. Make sure she feels safe by letting her know that you’d never judge her. If there’s one thing Sagittariuses love, it’s a space where they can talk freely."

      "title": "Sagittarius signs don’t have any time for games.",
      "content": "Sagittarius signs don’t have any time for games. They want you to be honest, even if it sounds blunt or harsh. Try not to sugar coat things, and tell her the truth always, even if she might not like it. She’ll appreciate your honesty, and she’ll trust you even more from then on. [4] X Research source Even white lies, like telling her you liked a gift when you really didn’t, won’t fly with a Sag woman. Just tell her the truth so you don’t have to lie to her and make her mad."

      "title": "Typically, a Sagittarius' love language is gift giving.",
      "content": "Typically, a Sagittarius' love language is gift giving. She's sure to appreciate the gesture and that you thought about her, even when she wasn't around. Pick her up a snack at the grocery store or buy her flowers at the farmer’s market to watch her swoon and fall in love with you even more. [5] X Research source Your gifts don’t have to break the bank, especially if you give them often. Even something homemade (like a card) or digital (like a playlist ) will fill her heart with happiness."

      "title": "There’s nothing a Sagittarius hates more than feeling smothered.",
      "content": "There’s nothing a Sagittarius hates more than feeling smothered. Fire signs are very social, and your Sag woman is probably going to be super busy with her own life. Let her go hang with friends or hit the club—she’ll love that she can maintain her independence without you worrying or checking up on her. [6] X Research source If you miss her, consider joining in on a group outing of hers. That way, she can get in some quality social time with friends while also spending time with you."

      "title": "Sagittarius signs love someone who is independent.",
      "content": "Sagittarius signs love someone who is independent . It’s totally fine to want to spend a lot of time with her, but she’ll love you even more if you keep up with your own friends and focus on your own goals outside of your relationship. Engage in your hobbies, hang with your pals, and work hard in your career. At the end of the day, you’ll be greeted by a happy, loving Sagittarius woman who is eager to hear what you’ve accomplished. Plus, focusing on yourself will give her some much-needed breathing room, too."
