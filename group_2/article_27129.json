      "content": "Melt 14 oz (420 g) of candy melt chocolate in the microwave. Gluten-free baking expert Gladys Jahn suggests pouring the candy melts into a plastic (microwave-safe) bowl, then microwaving it for 10 seconds. Next, she says, \"Take it out and stir it…put it back in the microwave for another 10 seconds and stir it again.\" Within 30-40 seconds, the chocolate should be melted. Candy melts are chocolates made with vegetable fat instead of cocoa butter. After they've been melted and poured into a mold or shaped, they harden quickly and produce a snap when you break them. Real chocolate has to be tempered first to stabilize the cocoa butter so it doesn't melt to the touch after it solidifies. [1] X Research source Candy melts melt faster than real chocolate, and they also come in a wider range of colors. However, candy melts aren’t quite as flavorful as traditional chocolate. If you'd rather use real chocolate instead of candy melts, custom dessert artist Maha Mohamed recommends melting white chocolate and then add oil-based food coloring (if you want it colored). Then make sure to temper it so it has a glossy finish when it hardens and holds its shape without falling apart."

Set a silicone dome mold on your work surface and scoop 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of melted candy melts or tempered chocolate into each cavity. [2] X Research source For larger teacups, use a mold with 6 semi-sphere cavities. For standard-sized teacups, choose a mold with 12 to 15 dome cavities."

      "content": "Spread the chocolate into the cavities and chill the mold for 15 minutes. Use a silicone brush or the back of a spoon to spread the chocolate evenly throughout the mold so each cavity is covered. Then put the mold in the refrigerator until the chocolate hardens. [3] X Research source If you used a mold with smaller domes, the chocolate will harden faster."

Gently push up on the bottom of each cavity to release the chocolate. The chocolate should separate from the mold.

To make the saucers, lay a sheet of parchment paper onto a baking sheet and spread some of the remaining tempered chocolate into 4 even circles on the paper. Each circle should be about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) in diameter. Then pipe or spoon more chocolate onto the parchment paper to make 4 handle shapes. [5] X Research source Each saucer should be about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick. If you don't have parchment paper, use waxed paper instead."

Then hold the handles against the sides of the chocolate cups until they set well enough to stay attached on their own. Then set each teacup onto the chocolate saucers and store in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve them. [8] X Research source Work quickly so your hands don't melt the chocolate. If the chocolate teacup pieces begin to soften, put them into the refrigerator for a few minutes."

Repeat this step for 11 more cones and discard the longer base pieces. [9] X Research source Use a gentle sawing motion as you cut so you don't break the cones."

Then push the cone onto 1 round shortbread cookie to form the bottom of the teacup. Repeat this step for each of the wafer cone cups. If you don't want to work with ready-to-use icing in a tube, make your own icing and pipe it onto the cones."

Hold it in place for a minute until the icing hardens, then let go and continue attaching the rest of the pretzel handles to the other 11 teacups.

Make the circle slightly larger than the size you want for your saucer. [11] X Research source If you don't have a fondant rolling pin, use a standard rolling pin and dust it with powdered sugar to prevent the gum paste from sticking to it.

Dust a little powdered sugar onto the saucer you want to use as your mold and then tap off the excess with your finger. Gently lay the rolled gum paste onto the saucer and press down firmly so the paste molds to the saucer. Then use a knife or blade tool to cut the excess gum paste from around the edge of the saucer. Set the excess aside and smooth the edges of the gum paste saucer. [12] X Research source If you want to include details on the edges of your saucer, press in the edges to create a slight scallop.

Use the fondant rolling pin to roll the leftover gum paste into an oval that's as thin as the saucer you made. Then cut a large rainbow shape out of it and place it inside the teacup with the arch at the bottom. Make sure the two ends of the arch overlap a little bit. If they don't, roll the gum paste out again and cut a larger arch. [14] X Research source You may need to trim or adjust the shape of the gum paste so it covers the inside of the teacup. Keep in mind there may be a small hole at the bottom of the cup. Before cutting the gum paste, cut out a paper template and nestle it into the teacup. Then cut it to a size that fits in the cup and use that as your template for the gum paste."

Next, brush water on each end of the handle, then press it against the side of the teacup. Let it dry for a few minutes. If the water isn't making the cup stick to the base, mix a little bit of tylose powder (also called CMC powder) into the water and use this mixture as an adhesive instead. To complete your creation, set the teacup on top of the gum paste saucer you made earlier in this tutorial."
