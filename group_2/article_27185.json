      "content": "Cut the base into the rough shape of your rock. Use a handsaw or a jigsaw to cut your material into the rough shape of your rock. Remember, most rocks are not completely smooth, so give your shape textures and dimples as you cut. [1] X Research source A hot wire foam cutter works well to shape styrofoam. If you’re using plywood or cardboard, cut small squares and then stack them on top of each other to create a rock shape. Then, use a saw to cut off the hard edges and smooth them out. To make a rock out of expanding foam, spray the foam into a circular pile, then wait for it to harden. Use a saw to shave down the sides and smooth the foam into a rock shape."

      "content": "Cover your rock shape in chicken wire or hardware cloth . Use a metal mesh to wrap the rock shape. The metal gives strength to your artificial rock and provides a structure for the cement mortar mix to adhere to. [2] X Research source Use wire twist ties to secure the wire frame to your rock base."

      "content": "Combine dry ingredients for mortar mix. Mix 3 parts sand with 1 part portland cement. Add all the ingredients to a wheelbarrow or concrete mixer, depending on the size of rock you are creating and amount of mortar you are mixing. [4] X Research source You can reduce the sand, and add 1 part peat moss to create a more porous artificial rock. [5] X Research source If you want to use the fake rocks in an area exposed to water, use a hydraulic cement mix instead."

      "title": "Mix the dry mortar and sand mixture into 1 part of cold water.",
      "content": "Mix the dry mortar and sand mixture into 1 part of cold water. The exact amount of water depends on humidity and temperature conditions, so you may need to adjust with more or less dry mixture. Slowly add the dry mixture to the water while mixing with a trowel until both form into a thick paste. [6] X Research source Stir the mortar mix into the water as you add it. Watch closely as you add mortar so your mixture does not get too thick. Aim for a cookie dough-like consistency."

      "title": "Stir the mortar mix for several minutes.",
      "content": "Stir the mortar mix for several minutes. For small amounts, turn the mixture over in the wheelbarrow repeatedly, or stir with a paddle attached to an electric drill. For larger amounts, use a concrete mixer. Mix the mortar to the consistency of cookie dough. [7] X Research source Ensure the mixture is fully mixed and uniformly wet. Add more water if necessary to get the consistency of a thick paste. You do not want the mixture to be runny. Unmixed blobs of sand will cause weak spots in the finished rock; be sure to mix everything completely."

Start from the top of the rock and slowly push the mortar mix down the sides. [8] X Research source You can also use your hands to push and spread the mortar mix around. Just be sure to wear rubber gloves to protect your skin. You can cover the bottom of the rock with mortar mix, or you can leave it as-is. If your rock is going to be sitting on the ground, don’t worry about spreading the mixture to the very bottom."

Gently stipple a sponge or a paint brush into the mortar mix while it’s still wet to give it a more realistic look. [9] X Research source Use your trowel to create dips and creases in the surface of the mortar. Press a real rock into the mortar to make imprints of the rock's texture. Press a sea sponge or scouring pad into the rock to create a pock marked look. Wrap a plastic bag around your hand and press it into the mortar to give a wrinkled look."

The concrete will cure and harden until your rock looks dry. [10] X Research source Although 75% of the curing is completed after 1 week, it may take up to a month for cement to cure completely. However, the outside of the rock will be dry after 3 to 5 days."

Smooth out rough edges with a wire brush or a sanding sponge to make your rock look more realistic. [11] X Research source Make sure the outside of the rock is fully dry before you try brushing it. Otherwise, it could crumble."

Dig a 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) pit in the shape of the rock. Placing the edges of the rock underground will provide a more natural look of a rock outcropping.
