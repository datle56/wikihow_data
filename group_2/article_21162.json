      "title": "Buy clippers designed for cat's claws.",
      "content": "Buy clippers designed for cat's claws. Nail clippers for cats look like scissors at first glance but have a specially curved edge to accommodate feline claws. Buy them in any pet supply store. Because Persians are large cats, you might have to buy slightly larger clippers. Ask a staff member for assistance. Never use scissors or anything with a straight blade. This can be extremely uncomfortable, if not painful. Keep styptic powder on hand, just in case you accidentally clip the nail too short or if it starts bleeding."

      "title": "Choose the right time and place.",
      "content": "Choose the right time and place. Opt for a time when your cat is calm and relaxed. Right after a meal or before a nap is usually a good choice. Make sure the room is quiet without any distractions, such as a view of the bird feeder. If you share your home with other animals, close the door so that they can't enter.

      "title": "Practice before you clip.",
      "content": "Practice before you clip. Hold your cat's paw in your hand. Do this slowly and gently. Start massaging it for one to three seconds. If your cat pulls away, don't fight them. Keep a gentle hold of the paw while allowing your cat to guide the motion. After they calm down, massage toe and give it a gentle squeeze. You will see a claw emerge. Give your cat a treat for their cooperation. Practice this on a different toe every other day until your cat gets used to it. Get your cat used to the sound of clippers by practicing on an uncooked piece of pasta. Sit near your cat, put the noodle in the clippers, and trim it. Let your cat sniff the clippers if they want. Get to the point where you can massage and gently squeeze the toe while you clip the pasta. Always reward your cat with a treat after each practice session.

      "title": "Recognize the parts of the claw.",
      "content": "Recognize the parts of the claw. Only clip the white part of the nail. The pink area is the quick, which contains blood vessels and nerves. Always stay away from this part of the claw. If you clip it, you can cause your cat a great deal of pain and put them at risk for an infection. If you accidentally cut the quick, apply styptic powder to a moistened cotton ball and hold it against the wound for 5 to 10 seconds. Buy it in any pet supply store."

      "content": "Make nail clippings a multi-day event. This is especially helpful if your cat isn't used to having their nails clipped. Schedule clippings based on your cat's preferences. You could clip the front paws one day and the back paws the next. Alternatively, you could focus on a different paw each day.

      "title": "Comb first.",
      "content": "Comb first. Use a wide-toothed metal comb. Start at the back of your cat's head and work your way to the tail. Pay attention to the armpits and the belly, where hair gets tangled easily. Move the comb with the grain of the hair. Use quick, yet gentle, strokes. This will remove excess fur and help you to detect matting. [5] X Research source Use caution if you decide to comb against the grain. It might help to remove the undercoat more efficiently, but it can also cause your cat great discomfort. Do this only if they don't seem to mind it. Otherwise, comb only with the grain."

      "content": "Detangle mats. Avoid pulling on tangled hair. If you find a mat, start combing in downward strokes at the bottom. Gradually work your way up as you detangle the area beneath it. If the metal comb doesn't work, try using a mat splitter, which you can buy in any pet supply store."

    {
      "title": "Begin brushing.",
      "content": "Begin brushing. Use a brush with steel bristles to thin out the undercoat, which leaves the topcoat healthy. Start at the head and gradually move toward the tail. Move with the grain of the fur. Keep brushing your cat until the undercoat is gone. Usually you can figure this out by how much fur is on brush. Check the brush after a few strokes. Remove the hair from the bristles and continue brushing. Keep doing this until you pick up little to no hair. When there is hardly any fur on the brush, the undercoat is removed. Remove the undercoat every three weeks. As you brush the fur, check for any unusual lumps, growths, scabs, rashes, or flaky patches. If you find one, visit your vet to have it checked out."

Sometimes Persians get a buildup of eye secretions that can affect their field of vision. A toothbrush with soft bristles will allow you to sweep away the buildup without harming your cat's eyelids. Use quick, gentle strokes. Brush away from the eyes. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use grooming clippers around the hindquarters. Persians often get feces stuck in their fur. This makes them prone to infections. Cut the fur around the back area of the legs near the anus. Repeat this process every 3 weeks. Avoid using scissors, which can pose a stabbing hazard."

      "content": "Bathe your cat once to twice a month. Persian cats' fur tends to get greasy, but frequent baths can remedy that. If your cat is young, start with two baths a month to get them used to the process. Afterward, depending on how oily their coat gets, you could cut back to once a month."

      "content": "Buy a shampoo that matches your cat's coat color. If you buy a clear shampoo for a dark-haired cat, you'll end up lightening their fur. Dark shampoos will darken the fur of a light-haired cat. When the shampoo and fur colors match, it will enrich the color of your cat's coat. Stick to shampoos specially formulated for cats, which you can buy in your local pet supply store. If you have a multi-colored cat, buy a shampoo that matches the dominant color in their coat. For example, you should buy a brown shampoo for a calico whose fur is mostly brown with smaller black and white patches. Make sure the shampoo is a tearless formula so that it won't irritate your cat's eyes when you wash their face. [7] X Research source"

If they don't seem to mind, continue to wet more of their fur. [9] X Research source If they put up a fuss, remain calm and talk to them in a soothing voice. Pet them as you wet their fur. Hold them firmly, but be careful not to hurt them. [10] X Research source Don't panic or get angry if your cat bites you, scratches you, or runs off. Let them stew in their anger. You can always try again tomorrow. It might take a while to get your cat completely wet. This is perfectly normal with thick and/or coarse hair."
