      "title": "Pour the water over the teabag.",
      "content": "Pour the water over the teabag. Place one teabag in each mug of tea that you are making. Then pour the hot water carefully into each mug. Cover each mug so the tea can steep without too much steam escaping. [1] X Research source You can also throw in a couple fresh peppermint leaves if you want!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the tea steep for 3-10 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the tea steep for 3-10 minutes. Let the covered mugs sit so that the tea can steep. If you prefer mild tea, only let the tea sit for three to five minutes. If you like strong tea, keep the bag in for 10. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the teabag.",
      "content": "Remove the teabag. After your tea is done steeping, remove the tea bag. If the tea bag has a string, simply pull it out by the string. If it doesn’t, fish it out with a spoon so that you don’t burn your fingers."

      "content": "Pick the peppermint. For each serving of tea you plan on making, pick 7-10 peppermint leaves from the stem of the plant. Try to pick leaves that are green and unblemished. If you bought a bunch of pre-cut peppermint stems, choose the healthiest looking leaves to pick off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the peppermint leaves.",
      "content": "Rinse the peppermint leaves. Give the peppermint leaves a good rinse under the faucet. Even if you picked the peppermint from your own garden, you still want to make sure to wash off any dirt or impurities from the leaves."

      "title": "Crush the peppermint.",
      "content": "Crush the peppermint. Use your hands to crush the peppermint by rubbing the leaves in between your fingers. Crushing the peppermint helps to release the flavor and aroma of the herb. You can also use the back of a spoon to lightly press and rub the leaves. If you have a mortar and pestle, use the pestle to very lightly crush the leaves. Makes sure not to overdo it when you crush the leaves. The leaves should look crumpled and slightly greener, not mashed to bits."

Then add either 3 peppermint teabags or 30 peppermint leaves. [5] X Research source It may seem like you are adding a lot of peppermint, but you are essentially making a strong infusion so that you can later add ice to the tea without diluting the flavor. You can also add 5 or so spearmint leaves, which gives the tea a slightly sharper flavor."
