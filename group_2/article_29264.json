      "content": "Draw an eight-by-four inch rectangle on a clear plastic report cover.This is going to be the base of your Kaleidoscope. Cut it out, using scissors. Draw three horizontal lines across the rectangle, splitting it into three 1 1 ⁄ 4 inch (3.2 cm) pieces and one 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) piece. [1] X Research source Note that you'll need to make it this size to fit your paper towel roll. To make these lines easier to fold later, you may wish to measure and trace these lines in marker first, then use a paper cutter or box cutter to lightly score these lines into the plastic. Do not cut completely through the plastic, however."

      "content": "Fold the plastic along the lines to form a triangular shape. The quarter-inch strip should stay on the outside and act as a flap. Tape the strip along the edge using transparent tape, so the triangle hold its shape. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Slide the triangle into the cardboard and create your peephole.",
      "content": "Slide the triangle into the cardboard and create your peephole. Cut a paper towel roll down to 8 inches, the same size as your triangle. Slide the plastic triangle into the paper towel roll. To create your peephole, turn the paper towel tube on one end, standing straight up. Trace a circle around it on black construction or contact paper. Then, poke a hole through the center of the circle, using scissors or a sharp pencil, and making it large enough so you can see through it. Tape the circle over one end of the tube. [3] X Research source If you'd like, make the circle a little bit bigger. You can then cut tiny slits along the edges so the circle lies flat on the end. Then you have some wiggle room to work with and won't have tape on the visible part of your kaleidoscope. And if there is tape that's visible, you can always cover it in glitter."

      "title": "Fill the pouch with beads, sequins, and confetti.",
      "content": "Fill the pouch with beads, sequins, and confetti. Anything small and shiny will do the trick, but translucent objects are best. You also want different shapes and sizes. Your kaleidoscope won't be shoved in a drawer anytime soon if there's infinite variations as to what can be seen! [5] X Research source If this doesn't end up looking like you want it to look, you can always go back into your kaleidoscope and make adjustments!"

      "content": "Place a square of waxed paper over the pouch. Place a four-inch square of waxed paper over the pouch and around the cardboard tube, sealing in the beads and sequins. Stretch a rubber band over both the waxed paper and the plastic wrap. Make sure it’s on tight so nothing spills out! [6] X Research source Trim the corners of the squares. This will make the kaleidoscope look neater. You can replace the rubber band with some sticky tape, if you like."

      "content": "Decorate the outside of your kaleidoscope. You can use stickers, wrapping paper, contact paper (just be diligent in bubble prevention!), or construction paper. Some contact paper looks like wood, metal, or gold. But why stop at paper? You could add glitter or sequins on the outside, too! [7] X Research source"

The light is bouncing back and forth against your report cover, creating this constantly changing display in front of your very eyes. [8] X Research source Take it away from your eye for a second, give it a quick, gentle shake, and put it back up to your eye. Just how different is what you're seeing? What happens if you do it again? Can you recreate anything?"

The best kind of \"mirrors\" for this are acrylic -- or those cheap little locker mirrors they sell everywhere when it's back-to-school season. They're not really mirrors, so they're fairly easy to cut into with a box or paper cutter. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Create your peephole. Here's how: [12] X Research source Place one of the circular ends of your tube flat on a piece of paper -- contact paper is best, but construction paper or even gift wrap will work, too. Cut about 1\" (2.5 cm) around the traced circle; with that extra 1\", cut little notches around the circle so it bends more easily (it'll sort of look like a firework). Cut a triangle or circle in the center of the paper to view through. Center the cardboard tube on top of your circle and secure the edges with tape (unless you're using contact paper, of course)."

With an object that's about ½\" (1.25 cm) larger than your tube, draw around the previous ones. Then, cut around the each of the larger circles with scissors. Lenses! [13] X Research source With one of the circles, cut notches all the way to the inside of the smaller circle -- this'll be called lens 1. It should sort of resemble a gear. With the other circle, cut notches to the outside tracing of the smaller circle — this'll be lens 2. Lay them flat against the table and bend the notches upwards."

Take lens 1 and place it inside your tube against the edges of the mirror, notches facing up; this should form a sort of makeshift pouch. Place your selected beads, sequins, glitter, gems, and/or confetti on top of this plastic lens. Cap your gems using lens 2, notches facing down , and use masking tape to secure it all together.

      "content": "Decorate your tube. The easiest way to make this kaleidoscope look as impressive as possible is contact paper -- so long as you work out the bubbles! But you can also use construction paper or even gift wrap to jazz it up. And then add on some glitter or stickers if the urge strikes! If there's some tape exposed where you secured your lens, cover it in glitter! It's easy and mess-free if you pour your glitter in the crease of a folded piece of paper. Just coat the very tip of your kaleidoscope in glue and place it in the crease, rotating it around until it's fully coated."
