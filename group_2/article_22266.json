Then scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds to kill any germs and bacteria before rinsing the soap off. Pat your hands dry on a clean towel before caring for your wound. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can also use hand sanitizer if you aren’t able to wash your hands.

      "content": "Hold a clean cloth or gauze pad against the wound to stop the bleeding. Choose a lint-free cloth you don’t mind throwing away or a large piece of gauze that covers the entire cut. Gently press the cloth down on your wound and apply pressure just above the cut. Replace the cloth or gauze if blood soaks through it and keep applying constant pressure until you stop bleeding.

      "content": "Rinse the cut with running water for at least 5 minutes. Hold your cut underneath cool or lukewarm water from your sink or shower. Move the cut back and forth through the stream so you can rinse out any blood or dirt that’s still stuck inside. Keep the water running over your cut for 5–10 minutes to help prevent infection. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Avoid rubbing or touching your cut since it could open back up and start bleeding again. Don’t soak your cut in standing water since you could reintroduce bacteria. If you need to, use a cup to pour clean water over your wound instead."

[8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Honey contains antioxidants as well as anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. If the honey doesn’t flow easily, try thinning it with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of water at a time.

[13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can buy zinc ointment from your local pharmacy. You may also take an oral zinc supplement instead. Talk to your doctor before starting them to see if it will interact with any other medications you’re taking.

Add fruits and vegetables like strawberries, oranges, apples, or spinach into your meals to help you get 75–90 mg of vitamin C daily. Opt for healthy sources of protein, such as eggs, lean meat, dairy, and seafood, in your meals since your body needs to work harder while you’re healing. Have about 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight. Try to incorporate foods into small meals or snacks throughout the day to ensure you get enough. [16] X Trustworthy Source EatRight.org Organization associated with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics providing advice about food, health, and fitness Go to source For example, if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), then you would need 54 g of protein daily.

Continue staying active even after you’ve healed completely since it will help you prevent injury and heal quicker in the future. [18] X Research source If you have a severe cut, talk to your doctor about what activities you’re able to do.
