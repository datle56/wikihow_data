      "content": "Make sure that the pump is close to the air conditioning unit, installed below the coil drain, and that the pump unit is level. If the pump isn’t level, it will not function properly. It is also important to make sure that the unit will not spray or splash when it is running. Once the pump is mounted correctly, you are ready to pipe the unit."

      "content": "Use some sort of flexible tubing, if possible, as the drain pipe for the pump. This pipe should be installed so that gravity will do the work when the pump is draining the system. The inlet pipe should be on an angle where it enters the tank and should not interfere with the operation of the float valve that the pump uses. [3] X Research source It may also be a good idea to install a check valve somewhere on the discharge line to avoid backflow of the discharge water so it can’t be sucked back into the a/c unit. The discharge line should run into a line that goes to the city’s waste, once again to avoid contamination of fresh water."

Ensure that the electrical units are working correctly without sparking and that the piping is not leaking in any area. [4] X Research source The best way to test a condensation pump is to pour room temperature water into the pump's collection container. Once the container is filled, the pump motor will turn on and discharge water out."
