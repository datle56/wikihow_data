Don't plant the lettuce during the early winter or summer, or it will struggle to grow because of the extreme temperatures. If you don't know when the last expected spring frost is in your area, look it up online. For example, you could search \"average last spring freeze dates for Kansas City.\""

      "content": "Slowly acclimate the lettuce to being outside. After letting the lettuce mature for six weeks, start setting the tray of lettuce outside in a sheltered location for three hours a day. Each day, leave the tray of lettuce outside for two hours longer than the day before. The lettuce plants will be acclimated once they’ve been left outside for a full day. The entire acclimation process should take around a week. [7] X Research source Don't leave the lettuce out at night until they have completely acclimated to the outdoors. This will typically be at the end of the process. It's OK if the weather hasn't completely warmed at this point. Properly acclimating the lettuce will help it develop a resistance to cooler temperatures. You should not plant the lettuce outside, however, until you are certain that there will not be another frost. [8] X Research source"

[16] X Research source Never water the lettuce more often than this or it might develop rot. You may also want to avoid watering in the evening."

You should make sure to harvest the lettuce before temperatures rise above 80 °F (27 °C)."
