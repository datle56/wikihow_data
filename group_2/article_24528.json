      "title": "Wash yourself with clean water before you begin.",
      "content": "Wash yourself with clean water before you begin. Before any prayer, you first perform “wudu,” or a ritual cleansing that prepares you for Salah. Say “Bismillah” (“in the name of Allah”) out loud or in your head to set your intention. Use your left hand to wash your right hand all the way up to your wrists 3 times, then repeat the process for your left hand. [1] X Research source Rinse your mouth out with water 3 times. Cup the water with your right hand and partly sniff it up your nose, then blow out the water using your left hand. Repeat this 3 times. [2] X Research source Wash your face with water, starting with your forehead and ending with your chin. If you have a beard, run your wet fingers through the hair to clean it. Wash your right arm 3 times, then wash your left arm 3 times. Wet your hands and clean your head, then clean your ears inside and out. Finish by rinsing your right foot 3 times, then your left 3 times. Offer the Isha prayer after twilight each day before midnight. Use a site like IslamicFinder to find your local prayer time."

      "title": "Set your intention while focusing your mind on prayer.",
      "content": "Set your intention while focusing your mind on prayer. Your intention (“niyyat”) is the purpose with which you do an act. Right now, your purpose is performing the Isha prayer while ending and reflecting on your day. Steady your breathing, center yourself, and focus on the prayer at hand. Contemplate Allah and the prayer before you. [3] X Research source Niyyat is usually done silently, but it’s common to repeat the word “Bismillah” to yourself in your head to help you settle into the moment. As you set your intention, think about how you went about your day, and resolve to go to bed after prayer with a clear mind oriented toward Allah."

After saying the Takbir, avoid anything that would disrupt your state of prayer, like talking, laughing, drinking, eating, or visiting the restroom."
