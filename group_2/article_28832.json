      "content": "Dig a hole or trench for the compost pit. Find an open space where you can comfortably dig a hole or trench—someplace near an existing (or future) flower/vegetable garden is a great option. Make your pit between 12 and 15 in (30.5 to 38 cm) deep and 8 to 10 in (20 to 25 cm) wide. Depending on your yard space, you can make the pit a singular hole or a longer trench. [1] X Research source Feel free to make more than one hole or trench, depending on the amount of space you have to work with. Digging holes rather than trenches may be more manageable if you don’t have a lot of compost material to discard. If you have fruit trees in your yard, consider digging compost pits beneath the outer edge of the branches. This placement allows the compost to nourish the tree’s roots more efficiently. Pro tip: To maximize your efficiency, set up your compost pit in the autumn months so it has plenty of time to decompose before the planting season. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Chop your compost materials finely. Slice or physically break down larger pieces of compost, like leftover chunks of vegetables. The more fine your compost is, the more efficiently it will decompose. [3] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Kitchen scraps can be ripped apart by hand, chopped with a knife, or even pulverized in a blender or food processor. Yard scraps can be broken down using a lawn mower. Aim for pieces no bigger than 2 to 3 in (5 to 8 cm) long, wide, and thick."

      "content": "Fill the bottom 4 in (10 cm) of the pit with compost. Don’t fill it up all the way—the majority of the compost pit will be filled with soil. If you end up having more compost than you expected, feel free to dig another hole or trench. [4] X Research source Use a shovel to mix the materials together so that they decompose as evenly as possible. It’s especially important to make sure your carbon-rich materials (such as paper and dried leaves) are mixed thoroughly with your nitrogen-rich materials (like vegetable scraps and fresh grass clippings). Well-mixed compost materials are important from the outset, as you generally do not turn the materials like you would with other kinds of compost setups."

      "content": "Cover up the compost with soil and mulch. Fill the pit until it is level with the surrounding soil. For a little extra protection, spread out some straw or other mulch over the pit. Seeding the area with grass or similar vegetation can also work well for this. [5] X Research source Do the food scraps look dry? Drizzle over them with a hose before shoveling the soil overtop.

      "content": "Wait a few months to 1 year for your pit to finish decomposing. Unlike other composting methods (like “hot” composting), a compost trench requires several months (or even a year) to finish decomposing. In well-nourished, well-draining soil, your compost can be ready in as little as 2-3 months, but this isn’t always the case. [7] X Research source If your soil is mineral-based and lacks good drainage, you might have to wait much longer for your compost to ready."

      "content": "Use a compost bin if you’d like to continuously compost. Place your compost bin in a shady spot outside to prevent it from getting too warm or too moist. [10] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Fill the bottom 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) of the bin with composting “browns,” or materials like twigs, dead leaves, clean cardboard strips, ripped-up brown bags, and the like. Then, build up the compost pile with layers of “greens” (e.g., cut grass, produce waste, eggshells, coffee grounds, etc.). If your compost seems too dry, drizzle with water until its moisture level resembles a slightly damp sponge. Turn the compost pile occasionally with a pitchfork to improve airflow and decomposition around your pile. [11] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Try to layer your “browns” and “greens” at a 2:1 ratio (or even 3:1). Once your compost pile lacks any food scraps and doesn’t warm up, leave it alone for 4 weeks so it can completely cure. At this point, your compost pile will be about 66% smaller than it originally was. Cured compost resembles soil. If you’re constantly adding to your compost pile, the bottom portion of compost might be ready to harvest before the upper portions. Warning: Don’t compost things like meat, bones, cheese/milk/yogurt, leftover oil, and cooked leftovers, as they can bring unwanted pests to your compost pile. Try not to compost materials like pet waste, treated grass trimmings, sick plants, or dryer lint, either."

Place your worm bin in a warm, 59 to 77 °F (15 to 25 °C) area around your home (e.g., beneath the sink, on your deck, in your garage, etc.). Fill the worm bin with a mixture of damp bedding (e.g., shredded newspaper, dead leaves, etc.) and soil, along with red wriggler worms . Feed these worms by setting food scraps on top of the worm bin, draped with 2 in (5.1 cm) of fresh bedding. Repeat this feeding process for 3 to 6 months, after which you’ll be able to get your compost (worm casings) from the bottom of the bin. [12] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Stick with natural food scraps, like fruits, veggies, eggshells, coffee filters, coffee grounds, and staple-free/plastic-free tea bags. Try to break down the scraps as much as possible beforehand so the worms can easily eat them. Feel free to use your worm compost in your lawn or garden as soon as you’d like. You can keep your worms in a warmer or cooler area as long as you give them a good cushion of bedding (at least 4 in (10 cm))."

Then, fill it with a mixture of both “brown” compost (e.g., clean cardboard strips, dead leaves, twigs, etc.) and “green” compost (e.g., fruit and veggie scraps, egg shells, coffee grounds, etc.), turning the material once every few days. In around 6-8 weeks, the compost will be processed and ready to use! [14] X Research source Check the moisture of your compost as you fill the tumbler. If it seems a bit dry, drizzle it with water.
