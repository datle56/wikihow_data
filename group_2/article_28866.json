      "title": "Create your list of crossword answers.",
      "content": "Create your list of crossword answers. If you're just making a simple puzzle, come up with about 10-15 answers that all tie back to a central theme. For instance, if you're making a puzzle for school, you might choose words that tie back to a lesson you're studying or a book you read. If you're making the puzzle for fun, the theme could be anything, like a list of movies you like or your favorite foods. [1] X Research source It's usually easiest to start by creating your answer list first. That way, you'll have a good idea of what length and width your crossword grid needs to be. If you're making a newspaper-style puzzle, start by listing several longer answers that fit your theme. You can fill in the rest of the words later on. Since newspaper crosswords have blocks of intersecting words, they're more complicated to create. It's okay if you don't know every single word you'll use in advance."

Then, resize the height of row 1 so the cells are square. Make sure the square is big enough to hold one letter. [3] X Research source Each time you release your mouse, all of the cells in the sheet should automatically resize, so you should end up with a whole sheet of neat squares. You won't necessarily use the whole spreadsheet for your crossword puzzle, but this is the easiest way to create even squares for your grid."

Then, type a name for your puzzle, like \"Anna's Crossword Puzzle\" or \"Crossword 11-19-2021.\" [4] X Research source If you know you're going to build your crossword around a certain theme, you might use that as the name, like \"National Parks Crossword\" or \"All About Space.\" You might need to adjust the font size so your title is easier to see. If the title looks off-center later, you can always shift it to a different cell."

Your grid needs to be at least big enough to contain your longest word or phrase, but it may need to be larger than that depending on your layout. Once you decide on the size, click the cell that you want to be the top left square in your puzzle, then click and drag your cursor so the whole grid is selected. [5] X Research source If you're just doing a simple crossword, consider sketching it out on scrap paper to get an idea of the dimensions you'll need to use. [6] X Research source Conventionally, most crossword puzzles are square, but if you want to create a rectangular grid, you can. If you're creating a newspaper-style crossword, it should be 15 cells across and 15 cells high for a daily puzzle or 21x21 for a Sunday puzzle. [7] X Research source"

Skip 5 or 6 columns on the right side of your grid, then type \"Across\" into a cell. Skip another 1-2 columns, then type \"Down\" into a cell on the same row. [9] X Research source Since these columns aren't included in your grid, you can resize them to be wider so the clues will be easier to read. Just don't adjust the height of the rows—that will mess up the formatting of your crossword grid."

Place some of the words vertically and some horizontally so they intersect across the letters they have in common. To make sure they'll fit, it's a good idea to start by placing the longest words first. Then, fit your smaller words in around that. [10] X Research source It can help to zoom out on the document while you're doing this. Adjust the formatting in your document so the letters are center-aligned. This will help the crossword look neater. [11] X Research source In a newspaper-style puzzle, every letter needs to be in both an across word and a down word, creating blocks of squares. For instance, if your 1 Across is the word \"MAST,\" you'll have a down word starting from each of those 4 letters. [12] X Research source"

Then, repeat that for all of the remaining empty squares on the puzzle. [13] X Research source On a PC, make quick work of this by hitting CTRL+C to highlight the filled square.

Continue to the next cell that starts a word and number it with 2, and so on. Then, do the same thing for your \"Down\" clues by working from top to bottom and left to right. [14] X Research source If two words both start on the same cell, they'll share a number. For example, if \"ASTRONAUT\" and \"AEROSPACE\" intersect on the first A, they might be numbered \"1 Across\" and \"1 Down.\" If a word starts in the middle of another word, it should get a new number. For instance, if the word \"ASTRONAUT\" starts on the second letter in \"NASA,\" then \"NASA\" might be \"1 Across\" and \"ASTRONAUT\" might be \"2 Down.\""

The best clues are short—only a few words long. It's up to you how easy or tough the clues would be, but each clue should be solvable. [15] X Research source For instance, for the answer \"PURPLE,\" you wouldn't use a clue like \"My favorite color.\" Instead, try a clue like, \"The color of royalty,\" \"Eggplant hue,\" or \"Some blueberries, oddly.\" If your answer is \"STOP,\" your clue might be \"Halt\" or \"Octagonal direction.\" For the word \"GRASS,\" you might use a clue like, \"Ground covering,\" \"Turf,\" or \"Snake's place.\" Try using a thesaurus if you get stuck coming up with a clue. More advanced crosswords frequently use clues containing puns, anagrams, and words that sound similar, as well. [16] X Research source"
