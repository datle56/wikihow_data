Take a piece of string or fabric measuring tape and wrap it snugly around the finger you’d like the ring to go, marking where the ends meet. Measure the area of the string you marked in millimeters with a ruler, or convert the fabric tape measurement to millimeters. [1] X Research source This is the circumference of your finger and is how long the ring band needs to be. Compare your measurement to a ring size chart to find your ring size number. Add a couple of millimeters to your measurement if you’re using a thick spoon or want a little more wiggle room."

      "content": "Mark the length of your ring on the spoon’s handle. Hold the ruler or measuring tape up to the handle, starting at the end of the handle. Use a permanent marker to make a dot or line on the handle at the same millimeter mark as your ring size. Consider making your first ring out of an inexpensive spoon. This way, you can do a trial run before making a ring out of a priceless antique or heirloom."

Use a hammer or mallet and start whacking at the handle until a “U” or “C” shape is formed. [4] X Research source Ring mandrels are tapered rods that have ring sizes built-in. If you don’t have a mandrel, try shaping your ring with a socket or metal rod. [5] X Research source Use a vise to help hold the mandrel or socket in place. [6] X Research source"
