When you take her on dates, never make her pay or split the bill. Girls love it when a guy takes care of the dinner bill like it's no big deal. But don't force her to be helped if she doesn't like it."

[1] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Make your compliments meaningful and truthful. Instead of \"Your hair is pretty,\" try \"I really like the way you did your hair tonight! It looks so soft and beautiful.\" Use different expressions, that show that you are thoughtful. Don't be ashamed to compliment her or show her affection in front of others. Real men aren't ashamed to show the world they've found a good woman, and your girl will love you for that. People talk publicly about the things they value. She will instantly feel like a priority if you are confident enough to show the world how you feel about her. Hold her hand in the mall or throw your arm around her at the movies, whenever she feels comfortable with it. Make a hint or ask her if you have doubts."

      "content": "Pay attention to her. After you've been together for a while, you can easily fall into a pattern of forgetting to make her feel special. Some guys also deliberately ignore their girlfriends as a way of getting back at them or as a way of punishing them. [2] X Research source Let her know you're thinking about her. For example, send her a text when you're thinking about her. Just be sure not to text anything you might not want her friends or family to read. Try texting her \"good morning\" or \"goodnight\" with a short encouragement as often as possible. A girl loves to know she's the first thing on her boyfriend's mind when he starts his day. Never ignore her as a way of being manipulative. You'll hurt her immensely, and if you ignore her often enough, she may dump you. Don't leave her waiting for you to call or talk to her. If you're having a problem, speak up. After an argument, wait for some hours or a day to cool down the heated emotions, that the longing for one another is stronger than the anger, and there is a good chance to make it up. Be ready to ask for forgiveness even if you feel she should do it first, but keep your own integrity too. In an argument, both sides usually cause hurt, and each one has the right to have feelings. If you wait many days, she can feel dumped and cut off her emotions.

Many girls will get bored if you take them to the same place time after time (unless it's a special place for the both of you) so mix it up a little. You should enjoy the variety of new places with her because you'll create new conversation topics and memories together. [4] X Research source Make sure you plan anything on a free night/day/weekend when you know she has things to do. Ask her about her schedule in a casual way so that she doesn't know you're planning something. If you can, surprise her with a love song or a short poem.

      "content": "Surprise her with gifts. Even a small gift, like her favorite candy bar, goes a long way. Listen when she tells you about things she wants, and surprise her from time to time by getting her something special. But don't try to \"buy her\" with luxury. [5] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Don't buy gifts at the last minute. Invest some time, and put some thought into it. What does she like? Music? Scarves? Delicate bracelets? A special perfume? Does she have any collections? Does she have a wish list somewhere you can buy from? Has she mentioned wanting anything lately? Perhaps you could ask your mom or her best friend for advice. Remembering what she appreciates is more important than the price tag. Never forget important holidays or anniversaries that matter to both of you. Listen to hints she may be dropping about what she wants. Thoughtful gifts will show her you care. Bring her to the mall and pay attention to what she points out. Get her something she can wear every day to remind her how much you care about her. A locket with a picture of you inside can be an awesome idea. If she gets you a gift for a holiday and you don't get her one in return, she's probably going to be bummed (even if she doesn't admit it). If this has happened in the past, make sure it doesn't happen again, and make up for doing it with a few surprise gifts. A gift can reflect how you regard her, and how much you appreciate her. That you are ready to make sacrifices for her. Also a very personal touch is often appreciated, like if you make a custom design item, doing it yourself if you are talented. Avoid repeating gifts, unless it has a special significance, like on a day of remembrance. Also, if she finds out that you gave the same thing to another girlfriend, she can dislike the gift."

      "content": "Keep your promises and be responsible Be punctual, maximum 10 minutes late ever, and make it a priority to keep your word to her and also to other people. A woman that sees that her man cannot keep his word, regards him not safe enough for a serious relationship. If you are hindered to keep a promise, warn about it in time, and make up for it afterwards, so she sees that you are a trustworthy man. A broken promise is often seen as the same as a lie. Asking for forgiveness is better than a lame blaming of circumstances. With time she will feel your real priorities. Show responsibility with studies, work and money. That signals that you possibly also could take responsibility for a family in the future. An irresponsible man can easily be seen as ridiculous and not a stable partner."

If you have female friends that you would like your girlfriend to befriend or if you want her to trust you in your friendships with other women, never compliment your female friends' physical attributes. If you have something positive to say about a female friend, say something about her personality, as in, that she is warm, friendly or creative. Or when it is really obvious: smart, famous, sporty etc. Whatever you do, don't lead in with, \"My friend is coming to town and I really want you to meet her. You'll really like her. She's gorgeous! All of my friends can't keep their eyes off her - when she's around, conversation stops because all the guys just keep staring at her!\" Understand that your girlfriend may be suspicious of your female friends at first. Always uplift your girlfriend so that knows that she is the only one in the world that you have eyes for. Your friendships with your female friends will be accepted much more smoothly if you follow this step. Avoid much contact with female friends that have no stable relationship, but possibly mention that she could be a good partner to someone else. Talk about the female friend mentioning her boyfriend/husband too."

Major lies will drive a wedge of suspicion and mistrust between you and your girlfriend that you may never be able to fix. You may throw away a whole relationship with just one act of mistrust. Show her you're trustworthy by your actions. Conversations you have with other women should never border the line of being flirtatious or intimate. She needs to know that she can trust you in speech and conduct even in the little things. If you have a hard time with this one, maybe you aren't ready for a relationship and should instead question why you feel the need to flirt with other women in the first place. Regard other women as humans only, not potential partners. When you are in a relationship, never tell her that another woman is prettier than she is. If she asks you whether another girl is more attractive than she is, then your default answer should always be a resounding \"NO!\" Never talk about how you find some celebrity really gorgeous. Doing this will only make her feel bad about herself, and she will resent you for it. When you do feel the need to comment on the beauty of someone like Angelina Jolie or Scarlett Johansson, always remind your girlfriend that, in your eyes, she is more attractive."

Show before your family and good friends that you are serious about her, that she will not fear that you might be seeing other girls. If someone hits on you online, tell your girlfriend right away. If you keep a secret from her, and if she is already insecure, then hiding your secret will make her insecurity worse. Avoid communicating with other girls over e-mail, text or social networks without letting your girlfriend know what you're doing. If you're flirting with someone else via text message and your girlfriend discovers your texts, then she's going to be furious. Invite her to take an immediate look at your mailbox if she has doubts. You must make sure even for yourself that you have chosen her, leaving all others girls aside, or she will probably feel it."

Don't expect a great girl to be available again… [7] X Research source Don't put your hobbies, video games, YouTube, music or other things you like before her. Never listen to music with headphones on when she's sitting there next to you, even if one earbud is out. If you have a duty of work or studies that disturbs, explain why and for how long. When she goes on a date with you, she doesn't go there so that you can play games on your iPhone and text your buddies. If you do things like that, she'll think you're rude and that you don't want to spend time with her, as any other person would think. After all, you can do that stuff as much as you'd like when she's not around. If she thinks you spend much time with less serious things, she can assume that you will not work hard for a good income later, but be a financial burden to her instead."

Some girls can and will take some low blows from their boyfriends, but in time, she will realize that she can find someone who will treat her like she wants to be treated. Also, if you hurt her badly, she will tell her friends about it. You shouldn't change who you are, but when it comes to minor issues, relationships require compromise from both ends. She should be willing to do the same for you. Both should be equally content at the end of the day, but sometimes you must take the first step. If it feels one-sided and one doesn't feel happy at the end, then there is no base for a relationship."

A woman may feel belittled if the man does too much, and doesn't give her the space to be in the leading position at times, like paying for a meal, or helping the man. Some women will feel humiliated if they cannot invite at every second or third date, especially in cultures with improved gender equality. If they have an income, they also may want to show ability not to be a free rider, needing a man for their own welfare. It should all be about love, not mere benefits. Balance in all, with certain mutuality, gives chances for a healthy relationship. Attention to the other's emotions is more important than rigid gender roles."

      "content": "Don't be predictable or treat your girl as predictable, but read her emotions and make nice surprises. Each person has a unique set of love languages, things that can touch their heart that they feel loved and cherished, while other expressions perhaps don't excite at all. The most common are probably: kind affirming words (not pure flattering), time priority, actions of service, gifts, physical touch, really understanding the other, remembering details once told, and showing no regard to obvious faults. E.g. a flower can for a lady mean as much as a home-cooked meal means to a typical man, and as little vice versa. Explain your own love language too, that she will not feel bad if she does things with a kind intention that don't make you excited. Kind massage is however a trump card, few people dislike it - if the situation is appropriate - perhaps starting with the feet is less intimidating, and a pure gesture of thoughtfulness without erotic associations. Girls know that guys can \"show love\" in order to get sex, and will feel used and cheap if that is perceived. If she feels disrespected once, it can create fear in her heart, that it will happen again. Never think that \"sex\" is at all the same as \"making love\" to a woman - make sure it will be for HER. Show love to make her feel fulfilled, and sooner or later she cannot resist, but wants to show love in her own way, which a guy really understands..."
