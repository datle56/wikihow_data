    {
      "title": "Be yourself.",
      "content": "Be yourself. Act the same way you do when you’re around your friends, don't act differently around them than the way you act around your crush. If you do, he or she will think you're being a fake. So act normal and friendly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be realistic.",
      "content": "Be realistic. Realize that you cannot make a person like you. You can be persuasive and encourage a person by being charming, friendly, and happy in their presence, but you cannot force their interest to focus solely on you. As such, it's important to be realistic and accept that they may want to be \"just friends\" or won't even want that. However, that doesn't mean that you don't try. It means that you learn to read the signs and respect the decision they make, as hard as it may be if it doesn't go in your favor."

    {
      "title": "Look good.",
      "content": "Look good. Dress nicely and neatly. Show your flair by wearing things that represent your style. Stay comfortable. There is no point in looking good if you're suffering. Jeans that are so skinny you can barely walk will elicit giggles in sports class, not awe-inspiring looks."

      "content": "Spend some time around your crush. Do you both like the same things? Perhaps you play the same sport or do the same activity during lunch hour or after school? Make the most of things you both connect on."

      "title": "Help your crush.",
      "content": "Help your crush. Has your crush been having some troubles in a subject you're just ace at? Hop in and offer some advice, and some tutoring help. What a great way to get closer!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Loan things or share things with your crush.",
      "content": "Loan things or share things with your crush. Show him or her your generous side by offering things when in need, such as a forgotten pencil or lunch, or a listen to your newly downloaded hit song."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make conversation.",
      "content": "Make conversation. Talk about stuff that they want to talk about. Talk about stuff that you would like to talk about. Ask your crush some fun questions, such as \"when is your birthday?\", \"What is your favorite color?\". Little by little you'll get to know her or him."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be nice and be kind at all times.",
      "content": "Be nice and be kind at all times. There is no need to be rude or to show bad manners."

    {
      "title": "Flirt a little.",
      "content": "Flirt a little. Act the same but with a little bit of flirting and feeling this time. When they make a joke, laugh genuinely. When you see them in the hallway, make eye contact and perhaps offer a wink. When you both are staring at each other, don't worry if either of you blushes a little––that just shows you that you're both attracted to each other.

To make things extra special, try to compliment their character instead of just their looks. You might say that they're: Intelligent Exciting Spontaneous Adventurous"

    {
      "title": "Break the touch barrier.",
      "content": "Break the touch barrier. Whenever you are sitting by them, angle your toes where they are sitting, then bump against your crush gently. Gently brush away a hair from their shoulder or even face. Gently hold their arm briefly. Be a little touchy-feely without overdoing it."
