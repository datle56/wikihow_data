      "content": "Mix sugar, borax, and warm water in a jar until thoroughly combined. Pour ½ cup (100 g) of sugar and 1 ½ tablespoons (38 g) of borax into a jar, then slowly stir in 1 ½ cups (350 mL) of warm water. [1] X Research source Mix until the sugar and borax are completely dissolved and the mixture becomes a paste-like consistency. [2] X Research source The water can be any temperature, but warm water helps the sugar and borax dissolve better. Alternatively, mix 3 parts sugar and one part borax together, then sprinkle the powder across your doorway and window ledges. Carrillo says to “use a duster to apply a thin layer,” or the ants will avoid it. [3] X Expert Source Kevin Carrillo Pest Control Specialist, MMPC Expert Interview. 22 October 2019."

      "content": "Soak cotton balls in the borax sugar water solution. Place a couple of cotton balls in the jar and wait until they’re completely saturated in solution. How many cotton balls you need depends on how bad your ant infestation is. If you have a small infestation, start off with 4 cotton balls to test where the ants are coming from. If you have any of the solution left over, save it for later use by putting the lid back on the jar and storing it in a cool, dry place."

      "title": "Set the soaked cotton balls where you see ants.",
      "content": "Set the soaked cotton balls where you see ants. If possible, place the cotton balls along ant trails, which are invisible pheromone trails ants create to guide other ants to food. The best way to locate these trails is to see if there’s a trail of ants anywhere. Check the cotton balls after a few hours to see if the ants begin swarming and taking the bait back to the colony. You can then determine exactly where they’re coming from! If the ants are entering your house through your windows and doors, place the cotton balls across your doorway and window ledges. If you don't want your floor or window ledges to get dirty, place the cotton ball on a shallow dish, index card, or lid. Just make sure you don’t use the dish or lid for food purposes again—borax is toxic to humans and pets!"

      "title": "Borax disrupts an ant’s digestive system and damages their exoskeleton.",
      "content": "Borax disrupts an ant’s digestive system and damages their exoskeleton. Borax contains boric acid, which is highly poisonous to ants. It inhibits enzyme activity in their digestive system and absorbs the waxy layer on the ant’s exoskeleton, leading to dehydration and death. Since it acts slowly, it allows the worker ants to consume and carry it back to the colony, which can help kill the queen and rest of the colony. [6] X Research source Can you just sprinkle borax to kill ants? No, ants won’t eat borax alone so you need to mix it with sugar. [7] X Research source Make sure to follow the recipe above for the correct ratio of borax to sugar. If you don’t add enough borax, it will not be effective."

It can also be effective in getting rid of common household ants like Argentine ants, pavement ants, odorous house ants, and Pharaoh ants. With that being said, some ant species have different feeding preferences, and they may not be attracted to borax baits. [8] X Research source If the ants aren’t attracted to your sugar borax baits, try adding 2 tablespoons (32 g) of peanut butter and 1 teaspoon (7 g) of honey to the mixture. [9] X Research source"

Ant sprays are specifically designed to kill ants upon contact, making them a great choice if you have a visible infestation. Apply insecticide around potential entryways in your home, paying close attention to window and door frames. You want to spray enough to wet the surface, but not soak it, so keep about 4 inches (10 cm) between your spray and the surface you’re spraying. [16] X Research source Choose an insecticide that contains permethrin, bifenthrin, or deltamethrin. Some ant sprays contain chemicals that can irritate the respiratory system and cause irritation, so avoid using them around children and pets."
