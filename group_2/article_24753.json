      "content": "Use ultraviolet lights at night. UV light disrupts cockroaches’ breeding patterns and life cycle, so it’s an effective way of curbing an infestation and preventing them from entering your bedroom. Use UV light traps , baits, or repellents to capture or deter the roaches. Place the UV light in an area with a lot of cockroach activity and activate it at night. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Consider the needed size, coverage, and intended use when choosing which UV light device to use. If you’re unsure, follow manufacturer recommendations or consult with a pest control professional."

      "content": "Don’t leave food out overnight. Cockroaches come into your house looking for food sources, so one of the best ways to keep them out is to take the food away. Seal and store food in airtight containers and avoid eating in bed. [4] X Research source Even if you put your food away after eating in bed, any remaining crumbs could attract roaches, so it’s best to avoid it altogether. If you have pets, be sure you don’t leave their food and water out overnight, either."

      "title": "Eliminate water sources.",
      "content": "Eliminate water sources. Cockroaches are drawn to damp environments, so remove any standing water in your bedroom and try to dry up damp areas. Check for any leaky faucets or pipes, clean any dirty dishes, and always dump and clean your mop bucket. [5] X Research source Cockroaches like to hide in damp, dark areas during the day, so by eliminating them, the cockroaches may leave your house in search of better hiding spots. Then, there’ll be less activity at night."

      "content": "Use essential oils to deter them. Strong scents like eucalyptus, lemon, lavender, and peppermint repel cockroaches. Dilute a few drops of an essential oil with water and put it in a spray bottle, then spray any areas where cockroaches are commonly seen. [6] X Research source Other natural repellents can get rid of cockroaches as well. Kill roaches by leaving out traps of equal parts baking soda and sugar, or spray them with undiluted vinegar or ammonia. Cockroaches are also deterred by the scents of cucumber peels and catnip, so you can also place them in dark areas or entryways."

      "content": "Set bait traps in areas with high cockroach traffic. There are plenty of ways to trap cockroaches . Commercial roach baits and glue traps are available at most hardware stores, or you can DIY your own trap using duct tape and a piece of food. Place the traps in damp, dark areas or anywhere you’ve seen cockroaches. Then, when the roaches wake at night, you can trap them. [7] X Research source Another option is to trap cockroaches using boric acid . Mix borax and sugar to attract the roaches, then sprinkle the mixture in a moist, dark area. Pest control professional Kevin Carrillo has a few different tips on how to lure cockroaches out of hiding. “The best thing to do would be to put out some sort of organic food on the counter and wait for them to come eat it,” he says. “You can use certain over-the-counter gel baits under the lip of the countertop or along the hinges of cabinet doors, since those are areas where roaches tend to go for food.”"

      "content": "Clean your home regularly. Cockroaches often seek shelter in unsanitary areas, so one of the best ways to deter them is by keeping your house clean. This includes sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping regularly, as well as wiping countertops, sinks, and your stove to eliminate food residue. [8] X Research source Cleaning your home reduces activity at night because the cockroaches will look for other areas where they’re more likely to find food. According to pest control professional Chris Parker, cockroaches are attracted to heat sources since they’re cold-blooded. He encourages you to check and clean “your dishwashers, your ovens, your grease traps in the ovens, and behind mixers in the engines of refrigerators.”"

      "content": "Reduce clutter in your home. Cockroaches can hide almost anywhere, so eliminate their hiding spaces by clearing out things you no longer need. Get rid of any old boxes or piles of paper, as well as anything else you don’t use or want. When they can’t hide during the day, they’ll go somewhere else at night. [9] X Research source Pest control professional Kevin Carrillo says that roaches commonly enter houses via shopping bags or boxes. “You can bring them into your home in the cardboard from something that got shipped to you or if you had groceries delivered from a warehouse,” he says. “You can have roaches delivered at any time, especially if you’re one of those people who store all of your bags under the sink or you keep a big pile of cardboard in your home.”"

      "content": "Seal any cracks or crevices. Cockroaches can slip through the tiniest of openings, so check for cracks or gaps in doors, windows, and walls. Use caulk or weatherstripping to seal them tightly. [10] X Research source Since cockroaches need warmth, they’ll likely come into your house. By sealing their entryways, you’ll reduce nightly activity because they’ll seek easy shelter instead. Pest control professional Chris Parker says cockroaches enjoy cracks and crevices because they make them feel safe. “They like to feel a little bit of pressure on them,” he says. “Their body is designed to be flattened.”"

While it’s possible cockroaches may crawl into your bed or over you to reach a food source, they're generally afraid of humans and try to avoid them.

If you’re concerned you might have an infestation, look for the following: Live or dead cockroaches: This is the clearest sign of an infestation. Since they’re nocturnal, you’re more likely to see one at night, but it’s possible to see them during the day, as well. You may also find dead roaches in areas they’re likely to hide. [13] X Research source An oily, musky odor: Cockroaches produce an odor that gets worse as time goes on. The smell typically comes from a large number of roaches, but it can also be produced by a single roach. [14] X Research source Egg casings: Cockroaches breed quickly and frequently, so finding egg cases is a strong sign of an infestation. They produce ootheca, which are long, brown casings that hold multiple eggs. [15] X Research source Cockroach droppings: Cockroach droppings differ depending on the species of roach you’re dealing with. Some common cockroach droppings look like specks of pepper or coffee grounds, brown stains, or oval pellets.
