      "content": "Gather the materials for your knit blanket. Set a rectangular loom with 64 pegs on each side on your work surface. Adjust the loom so there is 1.1 inch (3 cm) between each peg. You'll also need 6 skeins of bulky yarn, scissors and a knitting tool or crochet hook. Each skein should weigh 6 ounces (170 g) or measure 169 meters (185 yards)."

      "content": "Make a slip knot . Twist your yarn into a loop so there's a 6 to 8 inch (15 to 20 cm) tail at the end. Hold the ends of the yarn and use your other hand to pull the loop wide. Pull the yarn that's connected to the ball of yarn through the loop about halfway. It should now form a loose knot. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Secure the slip knot to a peg.",
      "content": "Secure the slip knot to a peg. Push the slip knot onto the peg that's on the upper row and farthest to the left. Lift up the loom a little so you can slide the yarn tail under the leg of the loom and set the loom back down. This will ensure that you don't accidentally work the yarn tail. Pull gently on the working yarn so the slip knot tightens around the peg. [2] X Research source"

Pull the yarn back to the upper row and skip a peg. Wrap the yarn around the third peg from the left. Continue to work around every other peg as you move back and forth between the upper and lower rows. Work to the end of the loom. [3] X Research source"

When you reach the end of the loom on the lower row, bring the yarn up and around the last peg on the right of the upper row. #Pull the yarn down and around the lower peg that's second from the right. Work the yarn back down the rest of the row by wrapping it around the pegs that you skipped earlier. You should be alternating between the upper and lower rows. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach the anchor yarn in a different color. Take a 4 to 5 foot (1.2 to 1.5 m) piece of yarn that's in a different color and lay it across the loom so there are even lengths at both ends. For example, you may have 3 inches (7.5 cm) of an anchor tail at both ends. Tuck the ends of the anchor yarn underneath the loom. [5] X Research source The anchor yarn will be removed once you're finishing the blanket, but it will help you handle the blanket as it becomes long on the loom."
