      "content": "Select a moisturizer. Super soft hands don’t come without the right products; any old moisturizer won’t do, if you want the silkiest skin. Find a moisturizing cream that is specifically advertised for use on hands. Hand creams are typically much thicker than a regular lotion, and have more nutrients needed for softening rough hands (which tend to be the driest part of your body). If your moisturizer is runny or thin, it probably won’t do the job you need to get super soft hands. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a good exfoliant. Exfoliants are used to scrub off the dead skin on your hands, both before and after moisturizing. The reason your hands feel rough to begin with, is because of the dead skin that is present. You can scrub this off, and then the fresh skin underneath is exposed. Exfoliants can be store-bought, or you can create your own. Try one of the following homemade recipes: [2] X Research source Sugar and olive oil, mixed into a paste Ground oatmeal and milk, mixed into a paste Coffee grounds and coconut oil, mixed into a paste Baking soda and water, mixed into a paste [3] X Research source"

Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. There are some specialty spa gloves available for getting soft hands overnight; these have a permanent gel that lines the gloves, that helps to lock moisture into your hands. Otherwise, any pair of knit or cotton gloves or mittens will work. If you don’t have any gloves, you can always use a clean pair of socks. If you have exfoliator gloves, made from a rough loofah-like material, you can wear those as well."

      "content": "Add your moisturizer. Put a dab of cream about the size of a quarter onto each hand; it may seem like a lot, but it will soak into your skin overnight. Massage the cream into each of your hands, spending time on the palms, between your fingers, and around your cuticles. Feel free to carry the moisturizer up your arms slightly, to soften the skin around your wrists as well. Don’t worry if your hands feel greasy or you think you have too much. [6] X Research source"

You have the option of adding a bit more moisturizer at this point, and dabbing on some cuticle oil around your nail beds. This will soften everything up, and leave your hands silky and soft. Repeat this entire process 1-2 times a week for hands that are always their very softest."
