      "title": "Butter a slice of white bread on both sides.",
      "content": "Butter a slice of white bread on both sides. Try sourdough for a tangy flavor, or an airy bread like ciabatta if you like the cheese oozing through the holes and burning on the pan. Buttering both sides will create a golden crust and a moist interior. If you use unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt to the pan to add more flavor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fry the bread on both sides (optional).",
      "content": "Fry the bread on both sides (optional). A quick browning for a minute on each side makes the toast extra rich and delicious. [1] X Research source If you prefer to keep the middle of the bread soft, you can skip this entire pre-cook step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add optional ingredients.",
      "content": "Add optional ingredients. A spread of mustard or pinch of cayenne adds a kick of heat. A thin slice of ham and you have a croque monsieur . If it sounds good to you, it probably is – although you should stay away from vegetables that get soggy when cooked, such as lettuce or pickles."

    {
      "title": "Add sliced or grated cheese.",
      "content": "Add sliced or grated cheese. Some cheeses melt into gooey goodness, and some cheeses have a strong flavor worthy of the toastie. Choose a cheese that does both, or combine a cheese from each category. [2] X Research source Here's the breakdown: Good melting cheeses: cheddar, Red Leicester, Gruyere, grated Parmesan, Fontina, Emmental, Muenster, Gouda Poor melting cheese (pair with one of the above): mozzarella, feta, provolone"

    {
      "title": "Cook for about three minutes.",
      "content": "Cook for about three minutes. Cook over medium-low heat, so the cheese has time to melt before the bread burns. Once brown and bubbly, transfer to a plate and serve hot. Eat plain or with chutney, brown sauce, or ketchup."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set your oven or toaster oven.",
      "content": "Set your oven or toaster oven. If your toaster oven has a \"broil\" setting that heats from above, this gives the cheese an extra crisp. In a regular oven, the \"broil\" setting is worth a try if it's located at the top of your oven, but the high heat can turn the cheese rubbery. [3] X Research source Here are your options: Oven (normal bake): Preheat to 250ºC (480ºF). Oven (overhead broil): Do not preheat. Move the oven rack to the lowest position to reduce heat. Toaster oven: Do not preheat. If there's a temperature control, set it to 250ºC (480ºF)."

      "title": "Choose thick-sliced white bread.",
      "content": "Choose thick-sliced white bread. Any white bread will do. Thick slices are another barrier against burning, but pre-sliced grocery store bread works fine."

      "content": "Cover completely with thin slices of cheese. Select a strong-tasting cheese, such as sharp cheddar. Use a cheese slicer to make several thin slices. Lay them on the buttered bread, overlapping slightly. Cover every inch of the bread to make delicious bubbling cheese hat, instead of a layer of charcoal. [4] X Research source Grated Parmesan works well too."

      "content": "Cook until cheese begins to bubble and brown. Return the bread to the oven. Watch it like a hawk until the cheese has completely melted and started to bubble, there also should be brown patches. This takes another 3–5 minutes or so, but even one minute too long can turn it black. This may only take 1–2 minutes if using a powerful broiler."

      "content": "Toast the bread in a low-temperature oven. Butter the bread on one side and place it in a cold oven at its minimum temperature setting. This recipe is quite quick, but you should check on the toast every few minutes just in case. Remove once toasted to your preferred color."
