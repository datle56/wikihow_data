      "content": "Measure your partner’s wrist and add 2 cm to get the length of your bracelet. Wrap a tape measure around your partner’s wrist to get their wrist size. Add 2 cm to your measurement so you’ll have enough room to sew the end to itself. If you’d like to add decorative rings or beads to your bracelet, add 3 to 5 cm more to your measurement. You can always cut off any extra strap after you finish the bracelet."

      "content": "Mark the length of the bracelet from the ring to the adjustable strap. Measure from where the O-shaped ring connects to the adjustable strap and use a pencil to mark where you need to cut your bracelet. Make sure the adjustable plastic part is pushed down close to the ring, then use a pair of scissors to cut straight across the bra strap at your measurement mark. If your bra has a hook instead of a ring, just wrap the bracelet around your partner’s wrist and slip the hook around the adjustable strap. [3] X Research source If you have an extra strap at the end, cut it off or tuck the end into the adjustable plastic piece."

Fold the strap over the ring so that about 1 to 2 cm of the strap presses against itself.

Put the free end of the new strap through the ring in your bracelet and sew the end to itself. Put the free end of the adjustable strap through the new ring and sew the end to itself."

Cut at least 6 in (15.24 cm) of any kind of thread you’d like, insert the end of the thread through the eye of the needle, and pull it through to create a tail. [5] X Research source Wrap the end of the thread around your middle finger and rub the thread between your thumb and middle finger. Pull the other end of the thread with your finger pressed down in the loop to create a knot . [6] X Research source If you’re using a needle with a very small eye, push a needle threader through the eye, insert your thread into the loop, and pull the threader through. To make your stitches super secure, you can also double-thread your needle by cutting at least 12 in (30.48 cm) of thread, folding it in half, and pulling both ends through the needle. Cut the thread with sharp scissors and lick the end of the thread so it’s easier to guide through the needle’s eye."

To sew the end of the strap down, push the needle through the back of the strap so the knot sits on the inside of the bracelet. Pull the needle and thread through the strap end. Poke the needle about 2 mm from where you made the first hole and push it all the way through both strap layers. Repeat this stitch until you reach the end of the strap. To knot it off, poke the needle through one of your stitches and pull the thread halfway through to create a loop. Push the needle through this loop and pull to create a knot."
