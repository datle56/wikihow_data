      "content": "Bring the crown of your head to the floor. Starting on your hands and knees, bow your head and bring the crown of your head down to the floor. Rest the crown of your head on the floor and put the palms of your hands flat on the floor with your fingers pointing away from your face. Move your palms away from your face to create some space between you head and your hands. This creates a tripod shape between your head and two hands. Your forearms should be perpendicular to the ground. You should be making a 3-point triangle with your head at the top.
