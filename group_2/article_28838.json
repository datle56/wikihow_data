The final hat will be 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) tall. If you want a clown hat, make the half circle 18 to 20 inches (45.72 to 50.80 centimeters) wide.

Poke a small hole into the hat, about Â½ inch to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) up from the base. Poke a second hole on the opposite side of the hat. Cut about 18 inches (45.72 centimeters) of thin elastic. Push or thread each end of the elastic through one of the holes, and tie a knot. [1] X Research source Try the hat on and place the elastic strap under your chin. If it is too loose, take the hat off and pull one of the elastic ends further inside the hat. Tie a knot and try the hat on again. Once the hat fits, cut off any excess elastic string. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of string above the knot. You can make the knot more secure by putting a drop of tacky glue or hot glue over it."

If you are making a bunch of hats for a party, consider making the hats more personal by writing the person's name in glue, and then using their favorite color in glitter. If you want to make the entire hat glittery, then use spray-on glitter instead. Shake the can for a few moments and hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface. Spray on a light, even coat and wait for it to dry completely before apply a second coat. Try working over a sheet of paper or a paper plate.

If necessary, secure the pipe cleaner ends from the inside using tacky glue or hot glue. You can use one pipe cleaner or a bunch of pipe cleaners. Here are some more ideas: Bend pipe cleaners into zigzag shapes. Wind a pipe cleaner around a pencil and gently pull it off, creating a springy coil. Bend the end of the pipe cleaner into a fun shape, such as a star or a swirl, while leaving the rest of the pipe cleaner straight. Wind two differently-colored pipe cleaners together for a candy cane effect. You can then use them as any other pipe cleaner. Make your pipe cleaner shapes extra wacky by hot gluing a tiny pompom to the end. This works especially well for the springy, boingy shapes."

Glue black tinsel along the bottom brim, and glue some plastic spiders to the point of each hat. You can also attach the plastic spiders to some string or pipe cleaners, and glue those to the point of the hat."
