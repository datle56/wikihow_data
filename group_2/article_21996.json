It may be tempting to see what the person is up to on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or some other social media site.

You may want to put those things in a box until you feel ready to deal with them. You may want to donate or even burn those things at some point, but for now, just stow them away so that they’re not constant reminders of your loss. If you do decide to burn things, ensure that you do so in a safe area where having a fire is legal — for example, an outdoor fire pit, not your bedroom floor."

You’d then come up with a plan for your next steps. It may feel sociopathic, but it really can help to approach your broken heart in this way.

This can help you get in touch with your feelings and even figure out how to get over them. If you’re out and you feel the need to vent, use a notepad or a note-taking app on your phone to jot down what you’re feeling. Recording your feelings can be particularly useful when you want to communicate with the person you miss or are upset with. Instead of contacting them, write them a letter or record yourself saying what you'd like to say to them. Do not send them the message though. This is just to help you.

I also didn’t pursue my own hobbies any more, and felt like I was just becoming a version of you.” It can be helpful to make a list of all the bad things in the relationship; just make sure that you keep it in a safe space or destroy it.

Have a positive attitude toward it. It can be helpful to even let yourself have a whole day in bed just reading or watching movies, or listening to sad music and crying your eyes out.

When the time comes, you can sit quietly and think about them all you want. Set a timer to make sure you don't go too long. You might try starting with two 10-minute periods a day — one in the morning and one in the evening. Try not to make the person the last thing you think about every night.
