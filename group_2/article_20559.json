In fact, a lot of photos of models and celebrities are digitally altered with unrealistic proportions. It's not a given that the if you get lean, you'll get a thigh gap; on the contrary, for tons of people, achieving a thigh gap just isn't possible. [1] X Research source Genetics and bone structure play the biggest role when it comes to gaining a thigh gap. Women who have hips that are set very close together are less likely to have a large gap between their thighs. If you have wider set hips, a thigh gap is easier to achieve with the right nutrition and exercise regimen."

Physical results could take as long as three to four weeks to start showing. Even then, some girls' genetics keep them from achieving a thigh gap, no matter how skinny they are. Whatever the case, it is not healthy to achieve a thigh gap by skipping meals or by exerting yourself to exhaustion. Stay motivated by noticing the ways in which a healthy diet makes you feel better, instead of simply looking better. You might have more energy, or notice that your clothes fit in a more flattering way. It may not be what you wanted, but learning to be happy with who you are is a skill you will need to develop whoever you are.

In serious cases, people focus on it so much that they begin to lose perspective about other important things in life, like health or maintaining social relationships. A troubling number of teens and young girls are treating a thigh gap in an unhealthy way, fasting and possibly developing eating disorders. Don't let the prospect of a thigh gap make or break you. Your thighs do not say anything about you. Do not let anyone tell you what to do. [3] X Research source If you feel very negatively about one physical feature, you may have body dysmorphic disorder, which can cause you to be extremely critical of your appearance. If you think you have this condition, seek professional help instead of working on getting a thigh gap. Instead of telling yourself, “I’m not pretty or attractive without a thigh gap,” positively reframe your comment and say something like, “I am so grateful that my legs help me walk, jog, and dance. They’re so strong and beautiful!”"

Even small restrictions, like eating 200 fewer calories per day, can lead to safe, gradual weight loss. Keep a food diary. You can write it down the old-fashioned way and look up calories online, or use an app like MyFitnessPal or Spark People. . Whatever you choose, try to be consistent. Figure out your “basal metabolic rate ” (BMR). This will tell you how many calories per day you burn simply by existing and allows you to calculate your daily calorie burn rate much more accurately. It is unhealthy to eat below your BMR, but you can try eating 1.2 times as many calories as your BMR. Try cutting your calories intake by about 200 to 300 calories. Make sure to count accurately, as overlooking how much you're eating is the main failing point of most diets. 3500 calories is equal to 1 pound, so by cutting out 300, you should drop 1 pound every 11 days.
