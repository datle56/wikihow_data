      "content": "The original Kibbe body system was invented by stylist David Kibbe. The concept was introduced in his 1987 book David Kibbe’s Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle as Only You Can . Originally referred to as an “image identity” system, Kibbe developed a styling handbook for 13 body types based on the interplay of geometric shapes, lines, and curves. [14] X Research source The intent was for women to be able to style themselves according to their body shape and type. However, Kibbe meant for his styling process to be used much more fluidly than how body typing is used today. Rather than strictly advising women on what they should or should not wear, Kibbe wanted to give a set of loose guidelines as to what types of clothing would flow harmoniously with their natural shape. In its modern iteration, the biggest benefit of the Kibbe system is giving people basic guidelines for styling that go beyond traditional body typing based on weight or simplified body proportions."

These Eurocentric ideals of beauty largely applied to White individuals with European ancestry and failed to account for body diversity across race, gender, and genetics. [16] X Research source Examples of Kibbe body types hardly ever feature BIPOC women, transgender women, or women in bigger bodies, and categorizing people based on body type or appearance can be a slippery slope toward body image issues, eating disorders, and fatphobia. [17] X Research source Many modern consumers are also tired of the focus on “flattering” or “slimming” silhouettes and want to move toward a fashion community where personal style is more important than dressing one’s body type to conform to the so-called ideal figure. [18] X Research source Other traditional body typing systems have faced similar criticisms and have largely fallen out of favor—the most infamous of which categorized female body types into vague shapes like apples, pears, upside-down triangles, hourglasses, and pencils. [19] X Research source Another body-typing system categorized people into three \"somatotypes\" (ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph) and connected these physiques to certain personality traits—a system whose scientific accuracy has been thoroughly debunked by modern research.
