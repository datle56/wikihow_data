      "content": "Heat the steel in a furnace or open hearth. You must heat the material to temperatures nearing 1,600 degrees F (870 degrees C) to make it malleable for forging and to remove impurities. During the heating process, substances like sulfur and silica will oxidize and separate from the iron, creating slag. The removal of slag greatly strengthens the steel."

      "content": "Forge the steel. [1] X Research source Strike the substance with a hammer, turning it as you forge. You will need to reheat the substance during the forging process to keep it malleable. Bend and chisel the substance on the anvil to form the blade shape. Target your hammer strikes to help shape the blade. Focus on the basic proportion of the blade initially. Forge the sword tip once you are satisfied with the basic blade shape, and then work on curvature and bevels. Bevel the blade in two sections: a long, sharp bevel extending to the tip of the sword provides the cutting edge of the sword and the shorter, thicker section runs along spine of the sword. Taper the blade on the end that will join with the handle."

      "content": "Treat the blade with a special clay mixture. You can add a mixture of clay and other substances, like grass and feathers, to the blade to achieve desired results. Coat the spine of the blade with the mixture, leaving the edge largely untreated. This will help make the spine flexible and the edge sharp. Reheat the blade in the forge."

      "title": "Quench the steel.",
      "content": "Quench the steel. This process both cools and hardens the substance. [2] X Research source You can use water or oil for quenching. Immerse the blade in water or oil along the edge and tip first. This method has a dual purpose: to make the cutting surface hardest and to keep the back of the blade softer to absorb blows meted out by adversaries. Quenching technique is important as the faster you quench the blade, the harder it becomes."

      "title": "Temper the blade.",
      "content": "Temper the blade. Reheat the blade to about 400 degrees F (204.4 degrees C) after quenching and then allow it to cool to room temperature. This process helps balance the blade's flexibility and hardness."

Build the handle out of a hardwood, like yellow poplar or alder. Quarter-saw the wood at the end to provide maximum strength. Install two brass or copper pegs and anchors and align them with the tang. They will hold the blade in place."
