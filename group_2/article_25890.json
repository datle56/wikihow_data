      "title": "Finish all the starter quests.",
      "content": "Finish all the starter quests. Before proceeding with trying to increase your level, finish every available starting quest in Wizard City. When you finish all of these quests, you should already be at Level 9. Finishing these quests will also provide you a lot of good starting equipment and a fair amount of money. Make sure that you complete everything in Cyclops Lane, Firecat Alley, Colossus Boulevard, and the Sunken City. These areas in Wizard City are only available by purchasing a membership or paying with Crowns."

    {
      "title": "Get a subscription or buy some Crowns.",
      "content": "Get a subscription or buy some Crowns. You won't have access to the majority of the quests in the game without purchasing Crowns or a membership. You can use Crowns to access previously-locked areas, while a membership opens everything up to you. Quests are the quickest way to gain XP, so having access to these is essential for leveling up. If you don't play often, you can purchase Crowns to open the next area you want to go to instead of buying a membership to access everything at once."

    {
      "title": "Complete every quest in each world.",
      "content": "Complete every quest in each world. Quests are by far the fastest and most consistent way to earn XP and level up. In each world, complete all of the available quests. Most players will progress through worlds in the following order: [1] X Research source Wizard City Krokotopia Marleybone MooShu Dragonspyre Celestia Grizzleheim & Wintertusk Wysteria Zafaria Avalon Azteca Aquila Khrysalis Four Dungeons Polaris Mirage Empyrea Some suggest skipping all of the sidequests in Wizard City and Krokotopia, as they don't give out enough XP to make them worth your time. Regardless of what you decide to do, make sure you start doing all available quests once you reach Marleybone."

      "title": "Do the Prospector Zeke quests.",
      "content": "Do the Prospector Zeke quests. Prospector Zeke can be found in the central hub of each world, and his quests are some of the most lucrative in the game. He rewards you with training points, which is essential for building a good deck. If you're speeding through the quests, make sure you take the time to talk to Zeke. Most of Zeke's quests involve finding items and bringing them to him. Make sure you speak to Zeke when you first arrive at each world, as you will be coming across the items he needs at each location you visit."

      "title": "Use attacks that cost more Pips.",
      "content": "Use attacks that cost more Pips. Each of your attacks cost Pips, and the higher the rank, the more Pips an attack costs. The amount of XP you earn is based on the number of Pips you use to cast a spell, following this pattern: 0 Pips - 3 XP 1 Pip - 3 XP 2 Pips - 6 XP 3 Pips - 9 XP 4 Pips - 12 XP You still gain XP if your spell fizzles."

      "title": "Get the upper hand in dungeons.",
      "content": "Get the upper hand in dungeons. When you enter a tower or dungeon, check that you get to attack first. If you get the first attack, you will have the first attack on every floor, giving you a big advantage. If you don't get the first attack, press Esc and leave the dungeon. You won't be penalized for leaving, and you can try again for the first attack."

    {
      "title": "Find a high-level friend.",
      "content": "Find a high-level friend. If you can join up with a few high-level wizards, they can teleport you to one of the later dungeons. You won't need to participate in the fights, but you will still gain all of their experience. By using this method, you can go from level 1 to level 18 in just a few minutes. Some of the best dungeons are Labyrinth, Crimson Fields, and the Tree of Life. You can only run each dungeon twice. You will get full experience the first time and 50% experience the second time. After that, you will no longer gain experience from that dungeon. Try asking nearby players for help running a dungeon, but avoid pestering anybody. It requires a time investment on their part, and can be a lot to ask of someone."

      "title": "Repeat old dungeons.",
      "content": "Repeat old dungeons. When you've started gaining some levels, go back through dungeons you've already completed. The XP gain won't be huge, but you should be able to breeze through them with your stronger wizard."
