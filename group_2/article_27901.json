      "title": "Purchase a set of white fake nails.",
      "content": "Purchase a set of white fake nails. The more they match the natural color of your teeth, the better. You could paint them, but it'll taste funny and might come off with your saliva. If you can't find white, aim for something that's a light flesh color. A standard set from the drugstore will suffice -- no need to get fancy here! You're only using two of them anyway."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick out the nails that fit your canine teeth.",
      "content": "Pick out the nails that fit your canine teeth. Your pack will come with nails that are all different sizes, so pick out the nails that naturally fit your canine teeth -- those are the ones that are already kind of pointy. Certain people will even be able to snap on the fake nails over their teeth. Can you get them to stick without holding? If you'd like, you can also put them on over your lateral incisors (those are the teeth to the right and left of your two front teeth). For some people, this is more visible and still looks okay."
    },
    {
      "title": "File them to a point.",
      "content": "File them to a point. You can use nail clippers if you're running out of time or feeling impatient, but a file is best. You can make them as pointy as you like, as long or short as you like, just make sure that the two match!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick them on with a bit of denture adhesive.",
      "content": "Stick them on with a bit of denture adhesive. You don't need very much at all -- just a drop. Any color works, but you'll obviously be better off with adhesive that's white or clear. Do not use nail glue. Or super glue. Or any other kind of glue, for that matter. Not only is it toxic, but you'll be left with fake nails glued to your teeth that you can't get off. This work just fine for talking and careful drinking, but try to avoid eating too much with them in. You don't want to end up swallowing your nails!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a small amount of braces or dental wax and roll it into a ball.",
      "content": "Take a small amount of braces or dental wax and roll it into a ball. It should be about half the size of a pea. And it doesn't just come from dentists! It can be bought in most stores in the dental section near the toothpaste. Who knew?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Press the wax into your canine tooth.",
      "content": "Press the wax into your canine tooth. Mold the wax to look like a fang. How big and outrageous are you going for? Make sure to keep it manageable so you can still talk!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bite down to mold the wax behind the tooth.",
      "content": "Bite down to mold the wax behind the tooth. You want to make sure it is situated in your mouth correctly. If you don't, it'll feel unstable and you'll be unable to close your mouth without jostling it. You want to be able to talk!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Suck gently on the tooth with the wax to try to create a vacuum.",
      "content": "Suck gently on the tooth with the wax to try to create a vacuum. This allows the wax to have a stronger hold on your tooth. The last thing you want is it moving around, falling out, or keeping you from talking without a lisp. Becauthe vampireth that talk like thith are not scary. You want to be thcary!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat for the other side.",
      "content": "Repeat for the other side. Then start freaking everyone out, eyeing their necks and all. Just try to avoid eating too much around them -- the fa√ßade might break if you're chomping on popcorn and your fangs pop off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off the tip of a straw right before the part that bends.",
      "content": "Cut off the tip of a straw right before the part that bends. You could use a non-bendy straw, but the bendy kinds top portion is just the right size. Don't have one of those? Cut off a portion of your straw that's about 2 inches (5 cm) in length. Obviously, you want a white straw. Red stripes could be blood, but only the dimmest of bulbs will be fooled."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold it in half and cut the open ends to a point.",
      "content": "Fold it in half and cut the open ends to a point. Force it to fold in half, forming a crease, and then cut each end to a point. You can make it super pointy and long or you can make it more subtle. How steep of an angle do you want to go for? Do this for both halves of the straw on both the top and bottom."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull them apart and cut off one side.",
      "content": "Pull them apart and cut off one side. They should be weakened enough that the two come apart with just a bit of tugging. You now have two fang-like caps for your teeth. Instead of leaving the front and back, cut off one fang on each, leaving a band to wrap around your teeth. If you left both sides, you'd be able to see two different fangs on each tooth. This way, the fang will stay on with the band of straw that wraps behind and the fang will only stick out the front."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put them over your canines.",
      "content": "Put them over your canines. Those are the teeth that already come to a point almost naturally. You could put them over other teeth if you really felt like it, but that might not get the vampire point across. These aren't super sturdy. You'll be able to talk and drink (ideally with a straw), and if you eat, try to eat at the back of your mouth. The benefit of these, however, is that they're super easy to take out and put right back in!"
