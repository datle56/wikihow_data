As soon as you remove the redstone block from the sticky piston, it will retract and the machine will keep moving through the air in perpetual motion. Remove one of the redstone blocks to stop the flying machine. This flying machine is a one time, one use machine. Once you reach your destination, it must be rebuilt again."
