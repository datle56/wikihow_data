Aim for either the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, [4] X Research source the New Jersey Transit (NJT) Northeast Corridor, or the NJT North Jersey Corridor Line. Some Amtrak Northeast Corridor tickets stop at the Newark Airport center. In contrast, others arrive at the Newark station, which is a good car-ride away and will still cost a pretty penny if you plan on taking a taxi from one location to the other."

If you're taking the Northeast Corridor line to the airport, then lookout for the \"NEC\" sign on the screen when you search for your train. Double-check that the train stops at Newark Airport. As you board the train, there will be a screen on the wall before you head down the stairs: it lists all of the stops that the train will take. The train will usually stop at Secaucus and then Newark Penn Station before your stop.
