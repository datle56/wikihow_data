      "content": "Choose an old shirt to turn into a crop top. You can crop just about any type of shirt or sweatshirt. Choose a top that fits you well or that is a bit loose if you want to add ties in the front, or go with a tight, stretchy top if you want something that will be form-fitting. [1] X Research source Try making a crop top out of a t-shirt, an old button-down dress shirt, or a form-fitting tank top. [2] X Research source Make sure to choose a shirt you are okay with cutting up! It will look very different after you are finished with it."

      "content": "Identify a crop top length. Put on the shirt you will be using and stand in front of a mirror. Fold the bottom of the shirt up and play around with different lengths until you find one you like. A typical length is a few inches above the belly button, but you can make the length shorter or longer if you like. Use a fabric pen or chalk to mark the length that you want the shirt to be. You may want to have a friend help you with this part. Ask them to trace a line going all the way around the top where you want to crop it."

      "title": "Cut off the bottom of the shirt at the length you have chosen.",
      "content": "Cut off the bottom of the shirt at the length you have chosen. Remove the top and lay it on a flat, hard surface, such as on a table, a countertop, or the floor. Smooth out the shirt so that there are no bumps in the fabric. Then, use a pair of scissors to cut straight across the line you have traced onto the shirt. [3] X Research source Make sure that there are no jagged edges! It is important to cut the shirt cleanly for best results."

      "title": "Reserve 2 triangular strips of fabric to secure the shirt, if desired.",
      "content": "Reserve 2 triangular strips of fabric to secure the shirt, if desired. Do not cut all the way around the top if you want to secure it in the front! Create 2 triangular strips of fabric in the front of the shirt that you can use as ties. Cut down from the new bottom of the top toward the old bottom of the top to create the triangles. [4] X Research source If you are making a crop top out of a button down shirt, reserve the fabric on either side of the front edges of the shirt where the buttons and buttonholes are located."

      "content": "Cut along the inside of the collar with fabric scissors. You can leave the collar in place if you like the way it looks, or remove it for a lower cut neckline. Lay the shirt down on a flat surface before you remove the collar. Be sure that the shirt seam lines are even and there are no wrinkles in the fabric. Next, cut off the collar of the t-shirt. Cut about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the hem of the collar to remove it completely. [5] X Research source Remember, you can always cut off more fabric for a lower neckline, but you cannot add it back on. Cut only a small amount at first and then try it on before you cut any more."

      "content": "Cut off the sleeves for a sleeveless crop top. If your shirt has sleeves and you want to remove them, then cut along the inside of each of the shoulder seams on your shirt. Cut a straight line using fabric scissors to remove the sleeve fabric. [6] X Research source To create openings in the sides of the shirt in the underarm area, cut out a longer sleeve opening."

You can make the section larger if you want a lower cut top, but try the crop top on before you cut it more. Slip your arms into the leg openings and your head through the hole you cut to see how it fits. [8] X Research source If you prefer a v-neck shape, then cut a 4 in (10 cm) strip along the crotch instead. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the legs shorter if desired. Leaving the legs as is will result in a long-sleeved crop top. However, you can cut the legs shorter if you want a short-sleeved top. While wearing the top, mark the sleeves where you want them to end and then remove the top. Lay the leggings out flat and cut straight across where you have marked them. [10] X Research source Try the leggings on again before you cut them any more! You can also use capri style leggings or bike shorts to make a short-sleeved crop top."

      "content": "Choose 1 yard (0.9 m) of a fabric that has some stretch to it. Opt for a cotton jersey or another type of stretchy fabric that you like to make your crop top. This will help to ensure that the crop top will be form-fitting and flattering. You can use a print or solid fabric. Avoid fabrics that are bulky or rigid, such as wool, pleather, and velvet."

      "content": "Measure the circumference of your bust, waist, and upper arms. Accurate measurements will help you to create a crop top that fits you well. Use a soft, flexible measuring tape to find the circumference (area around) your waist, bust, and upper arms. Write down the measurements. [11] X Research source Measure the area around your waist where you want the bottom of the crop top to fall. For example, if you want the crop top to end at your belly button, then measure around this area. Measure at the widest part of your bust and upper arms."

Fold your fabric in half and draw a rectangle on it that is half the width of your bust measurement on 1 side and half the width of your waist measurement on the other side. The rectangles should be the length of the distance between your bust and waist. [12] X Research source For example, if your bust measurement was 34 in (86 cm), waist was 29 in (74 cm), and the distance between the 2 is 13 in (33 cm), then your rectangles would need to be 17 by 14.5 by 13 in (43 by 37 by 33 cm). Add 1 in (2.5 cm) to each of these measurements only if you plan to hem the fabric. Cut along the lines you have drawn on the fabric to ensure an even cut."

Then, cut along the lines to get 2 equal-sized pieces. You may make the sleeves as long or as short as you want them to be. [13] X Research source For example, if your arm circumference is 16 in (41 cm) and you want 6 in (15 cm) sleeves, then cut 2 rectangles that are 16 by 6 in (41 by 15 cm). Make sure to add 1 in (2.5 cm) to each of both measurements if you plan to hem the fabric. Follow the lines you have drawn on the fabric to ensure that you cut it evenly."

Then, sew a zigzag stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the edges of the 2 pieces that will be the sides of the crop top.

Fold over the raw edges of the fabric by about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) and sew to secure the folded fabric on the inside of the shirt and sleeves. [16] X Research source Make sure that the fabric is folded so that the raw edges will be hidden on the inside of the shirt. Fold the raw edges towards the wrong (back or inside) of the fabric. Cut the excess thread after you finish hemming the shirt."

Sew a straight stitch in the shape of a square or diamond around the edges where the sleeve and body piece overlap. Then, repeat on the other side of the body piece to secure the other sleeve. [17] X Research source Cut the excess thread when you are finished, and then try on your crop top! It is finished! Crop tops are useful for the petite. A crop top might end to your waist. You can wear it with a high-waisted bottom with high-waisted jeans, high-waisted pants, high waisted skirts so that you do not show your skin. It is better not to wear a longer t-shirt underneath because it is not in keeping with the purpose of a crop top that is supposed to be a short piece."
