If you don’t have masking tape, you can use any other type of tape as long as it isn’t electrically conductive. Electrical tape is another safe bet."

The paper should measure 7 inches by 7 inches, and the foil square should sit right in the center or it, so that it looks like a silver square inside of a white one. Use masking tape to fasten the foil square to the white paper. Tape all around the foil square to ensure it sits smoothly against the paper."

The paper-foil square should form a tube that’s slightly larger than the paper towel roll. The fit should be snug, but not so snug that you can’t easily move the paper towel roll in and out of the paper-foil tube. Be sure to have the aluminum foil facing out, so that the paper touches the roll. You want to insulate the two foil squares from each other, so make sure they don’t touch."

Wind the wire around the toilet paper roll 25 times, being sure to make tight, close winds. Don't forget to leave a foot-long piece of wire at both the start and finish of your coil. 25 turns will work out to roughly 13 feet (4 m) of enamelled wire. Enamelled wires are ideal for the coils because their coating is easier to remove once they’re coiled, and you will need to remove some of the coating in order for the tuning bar to work with the coil (we’ll come to this later)."

These pieces of wood do not have to be the exact same length. Many people use scrap wood to construct the base, so if you have other sizes lying around, you are welcome to use those.

The bottom of the L should be lined up with, and perpendicular to, the right end of the base. The top of the L (the longer side of the L) should be parallel with the base.

Place the coil at a distance from the tuning bar that allows the bar to sit on top of the coil. You need to be able to move the tuning bar back and forth over the secondary coil, much like a windshield wiper moves across a car window. You can use masking tape to fasten the coil to the base. Just place a strip on the inside of either side of the coil and connect it to the base."

Piezo ear pieces are good because they have a high impedance of 6k- 10k Ohms [2] X Research source . Old telephone ear pieces that are 150 Ohms are not suitable.

Try a different pipe in the house — make sure it extends to the ground. Good grounds include a steel rod for your house wiring (check below your electric meter and ask an experienced adult to connect this), a cold water pipe, sink faucet as long as piping is metal, or a steel beam house support. Decent but less effective grounds include a heating or air-conditioner register, metal window frame, a longer 20-foot ground wire laid on the floor, or a ground wire wrapped around a metal drain pipe or water pipe."

Other suitable choices include a wire run along the ceiling of an upper floor room or hallway, or a wire run along a basement ceiling. Avoid running your antenna along basement floor or inside any metal buildings. This would work well for a ground, but not for an antenna. Make sure that the wire does not run close to anything that is conductive: metal roofs, chain link fences, etc."
