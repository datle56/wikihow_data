[4] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Foods with strong scents, such as garlic, onions, and spices like curry can contribute to body odor. Other products like coffee and tobacco may also be contributing factors. Limiting how much of these you eat or use will ultimately keep your underarms feeling and smelling fresh. If you want to determine if a particular food is causing offensive body odor, eliminate it from your diet and see if the problem goes away. If it does not, try eliminating other foods one by one until you determine which one has the effect. Chewing on leafy greens like parsley, or taking wheat grass supplements with meals may also reduce the problem, as these foods are natural deodorizers."

This means that a antiperspirant will also control odor, while a deodorant alone may only mask it. Most antiperspirants contain aluminum compounds. When you apply the deodorant, these compounds block your sweat glands, preventing perspiration. Some research, however, suggests that there may be a link between aluminum and issues like breast cancer and Alzheimer’s. Other research draws more mixed conclusions.

[10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Many also believe it improves appearance. You can choose an electric razor, a non-electric razor with disposable blades, or a disposable razor. Begin by washing. Shave after showering and drying your underarms. The warmth will open the pores of your skin, making it somewhat easier to remove hair. Apply shaving cream, if desired. Many people prefer to use a shaving cream to make the shaving process easier and to reduce irritation. Follow the directions your cream supplies, but generally speaking you will only need to apply a thin, even coat. Unscented cream is best, because it lessens chances of irritation and allergic reaction. [11] X Research source Carefully use the razor to remove hair from your underarms. Go slowly and carefully, as your underarms are curved and difficult to shave. You do not want to cut or nick your skin in the process. Shaving in the direction that the hair grows will reduce the chance of razor burn and ingrown hairs. Use a mild astringent afterwards. Apply a mild astringent, such as witch hazel, after shaving to reduce irritation. Exactly how often you will want to shave depends on how fast your hair grows, your personal preference, and other factors. Replace your razors regularly. It's time to get a new one when you see an accumulation of waste in the razor. This waste can introduce bacteria to your pores and cause an infection.

The strong chemicals used in these creams are potentially caustic to the skin and can cause irritation. [13] X Research source Carefully follow all directions provided with the cream. Due to the harshness of the chemicals, it is safer to leave the cream on for less than the lowest recommended time. [14] X Research source Always test a depilatory cream before a full use. Apply to only a very small portion of your skin, then wait 24 hours. If you do not have any allergic reactions like redness, swelling, or itching, then it is likely safe for use on your skin.

[16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hair should be neither too short nor too long for optimum waxing—about ¼ of an inch is a good length. If it is longer than that, trim the hair before waxing. Clean, exfoliate, and dry your underarms before waxing. Using a quality cosmetic wax, apply a strip or thin layer in the opposite direction that your hair grows in. Remove according to the product directions. Use a cooling moisturizer, aloe, or ice afterwards to ease the pain and irritation. Waxing requires skill and can be painful and even dangerous, so you may want to have a professional take care of this. Be sure to go to a reputable and clean salon [17] X Research source"

If you find this darkening disagreeable, you may want to lighten the skin. There are commercial skin lightening creams, but these are not well-regulated and may contain harsh chemicals. Luckily, there are natural ways of lightening the skin. Some of the simplest and most effective include: Try using honey as a simple and safe remedy that may help lighten skin. Apply raw honey over your armpits and leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes. Then, rinse it away. You can also combine a ½ tablespoon of honey with a tablespoon of yogurt or ½ teaspoon of lemon juice to intensify the effects. [19] X Research source Often, dead skin cells cause underarm skin to darken, so regular exfoliation can also help. Exfoliants can dry out and irritate the skin, so choose a mild one."
