If you want to do dinner and a movie, there's nothing wrong with that. The point is for the two of you to spend time together. Put your phones away on date night so you can spend quality time together.

Okay, it's true that the word \"planning\" seems to contradict the word \"spontaneity\"—but if you're married with kids, you know nothing can ever truly be spontaneous. Instead, orchestrate moments that give you the opportunity to indulge in a little impromptu intimacy.

They'll probably only be gone for a minute or two, but that's plenty of time to do a little making out."

You probably remember a time when the roles were reversed—these things happen. The last thing you want to do is get mad at them or try and force the issue.

Even if it's just for a few minutes, it'll help you feel closer to each other. A lot of mental and emotional intimacy comes from getting to know each other and being vulnerable around each other. If you've been married for a while, you might feel like you already know your spouse, so you've stopped making an effort to get to know them or ask them questions. Trying something new, like learning a new hobby together, can help you see each other in a new light.
