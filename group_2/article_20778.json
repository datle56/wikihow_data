      "title": "Verify ownership.",
      "content": "Verify ownership. This sounds obvious, but the first step before you can give away a vehicle is to make sure that you are the legal owner. To do that, you must have the title. The title is a certificate that you should have received from the dealer, probably after you paid off all the loans. The title will name the rightful owner or owners of the vehicle. If you have lost your title certificate, you will need to get a replacement from your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Each state has a different procedure and fee for this. At https://www.dmv.org/replacing-a-lost-title.php you can find a handy map of the U.S. with contact information for the DMV in each state."

      "content": "Involve Probate Court, if an inheritance. If the owner’s name on the title is someone who is deceased, and the gift is an inheritance, you may need to go to Probate Court to get an order for the transfer. Alternatively, in some states, it is possible to file a simple affidavit with the Registry of Motor Vehicles in order to take possession. You will need to check with your state law. [2] X Research source If the car was owned jointly by a married couple, for example, and one dies and the remaining owner wants to give the car away as a gift, the surviving individual can, in most cases, transfer the car alone. A copy of the death certificate may be needed to accompany the title."

Many title certificates specify that the writing must be done cleanly and clearly, with no erasures or cross-outs.

      "content": "Get lienholders to sign off. If the lienholders have not yet already given you something to show that the loans are satisfied, you will need to have them sign off on the title as satisfied in full. If your loan was from a dealer, you will want to contact the lending department. If you obtained your loan from a bank or some other lending institution, then find your original loan paperwork. That will tell you who to contact for payoff information."

This is not exactly a concern for the person giving the gift, but the new owner, in order to drive the car, will have to get it insured and registered. The new owner's insurance company will usually issue the owner a card or letter to show proof of insurance. [5] X Research source"

The Registry will deliver this in your own name, usually within a couple weeks. When it arrives, check the new Certificate of Title to make sure that the information is all printed accurately. This document is your proof of ownership of the vehicle. If there are any errors, even if they appear minor (such as an incorrect middle initial, for example), these could cause trouble for you in the future. If you see any mistakes, notify the Registry of Motor Vehicles immediately. You will probably have to submit an application for a correction. [8] X Research source"
