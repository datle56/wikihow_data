      "content": "Take out an aluminum pot. Place it on the burner (stovetop). Turn the temperature up to medium, mid-high heat. Allow your pot to warm up as you prepare the rest of the pap. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source If you have a gas stove, turn the heat down to medium, mid-low. A gas stove will heat up much faster than an electric stove. You can use other types of pots as well such as steel or copper. However, aluminum pots will transfer heat more equitable throughout your dish."

      "title": "Pour water into the pot.",
      "content": "Pour water into the pot. You can use tap water or purified water. Pour in about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of water (500-600 mL). Allow the water to sit in the pot until it comes to boil. Add one teaspoon of salt to the water. [3] X Research source Do not let the water boil over. If you have a low-standing pot, turn the heat down slightly or pour some of the water off into your sink."

      "content": "Add in the maize meal. Maize meal is basically a South African version of grits and cornmeal. Add in about 2-3 cups of maize meal to the boiling water. Place the lid on the pot. Turn the heat down to medium. [4] X Research source If you are using a gas stove, keep the heat at medium, mid-low. You can use either rice or grits as a substitute for Maize meal."

      "title": "Stir your maize meal.",
      "content": "Stir your maize meal. After you have let the maize meal simmer for five minutes, remove the lid. Stir the mixture so that the heat is distributed equally. You can add in a little butter for extra flavor. Replace the lid, and reduce the heat to low. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source You can use margarine as a substitute for butter. The goal is to have the ingredients mixed well, without being either too thick or too thin. Take some maize meal in a spoon and drop back into the pot. If it slowly slides off your spoon, that is a good consistency."

      "title": "Simmer the maize meal for another half an hour.",
      "content": "Simmer the maize meal for another half an hour. Only remove the lid once or twice to stir. Immediately replace the lid when you are done stirring. It might not take the full half hour to cook. Make sure to keep an eye on the pot so that your maize meal does not burn. If you feel as if the pot is getting too hot, you can slant the lid so that a small section allows hot air to go free. Let the lid stay slanted for a minute before you replace it. You can also add some more butter here if you feel as if the consistency is too thin."
