In addition to reading the plain facts, read opinion pieces. See all sides of an issue so you can develop an informed opinion. Do not hide uncommon opinions.

      "content": "Recognize your unique role in the group. There are many ways to be an important member of a group, and you probably already have a natural role within the groups that you engage with. This role may not be someone who is at the center of attention at all times, but your role is important nonetheless. Think about your role when you are in a group and try to be proud of this contribution. For example, you might be the type of person who is quiet most of the time, but who says insightful or funny things whenever you do speak. Or, you might be the member of your group who others look to for direction or to keep everyone on track. Still another role might be as a supporter. You might be the one who encourages other people within your group and helps them to feel comfortable."

      "content": "Express your opinions. Once you've developed your opinions, be assertive and express them. If you simply agree in arguments and discussions, you won't stand out from the crowd. Feel free to express your opinion when discussing issues like politics and current events. This will make people notice you more. Remember to be respectful when voicing your opinion. You can stand out if you're argumentative, but it may not be in a positive manner. You can phrase your opinion by beginning with something like, \"I see what you're saying, but I actually disagree.\" Remember that your needs and feelings matter. Work on being willing to express yourself to be more assertive. Also, remind yourself that it is okay to say “no.” Try to practice saying no in situations that are low stakes. [11] X Research source For example, if a member of the group asks, “Does everyone like the idea of ordering pizza for lunch?” then you might say something like, “No, actually.

[12] X Research source Talk about interests that are unique to you. For example, maybe you're an expert on French history. Talk to someone about a new book about French history you're reading.
