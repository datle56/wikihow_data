Keep heating it at 30-second intervals, stirring between each one, until the petroleum jelly is liquid. The petroleum jelly should be clear, with no lumps or clumps.

Choose one of the additions from the list below, then stir it into your lip balm base. Use crushed blush or eye shadow to add color. A smidge of lipstick will also work.

Great carrier oils and their uses include: [6] X Research source Coconut oil smells and tastes great. It's solid at room temperature, but it melts quickly. Olive oil is a great, easy-to-find oil.

Peppermint or spearmint are cool and refreshing. You can use up to 16 drops. Mandarin, orange (sweet), or tangerine are sweet and tangy. Lemon or lime are safe as long as they are distilled and not cold-pressed. Lavender and rose have a wonderful scent, but not everyone likes their flavor.
