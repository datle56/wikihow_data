If you prefer, though, you can also place the fruit in a blender and process them until liquefied. Liquefying the oranges and lemons usually provides the best flavor, but finely chopping them can work well too if you don’t have a blender. If you want to liquefy the fruit without a blender, you can mash the pieces with a potato mashes to help break them down."

Add the oranges, lemons, 6 pounds (2.7 kg) of white granulated sugar, ½ teaspoon (1.2 g) of grape tannin, and 2 teaspoons (8.8 g) of yeast nutrient to a fermentation container. A food grade bucket works well as a fermentation container. You can usually find food grade buckets and other fermentation containers at stores or online retailers that sell wine-making supplies. Some hardware or home improvement stores may sell them as well."

When all of the ingredients are in the fermentation container, slowly transfer the boiling water to it. Use a spoon with a long handle to carefully mix the ingredients together until the sugar granules completely dissolves, which can take 3 to 5 minutes.

Reserve the liquid in a second fermentation container that’s made of glass. The container should be made of glass so that you can see into to determine how far along the fermentation process is.
