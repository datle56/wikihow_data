[5] X Research source Feline Behavior for the Veterinarian. Bonnie Beaver. WB Saunders. 2nd edition If your cat displays symptoms like increased thirst, altered appetite (decreased or increased), changes in bowel movements (diarrhea or constipation), and other physical abnormalities such as vomiting or sneezing, these may all be signs of a physical illness. It can be difficult to distinguish psychological issues and physical illness in your cat, as there is a big overlap with the quiet behavior of a depressed cat and a cat that is ill. So, if your cat starts behaving oddly in any way, get her checked out by the vet to ensure she is not sick. From this diagnosis, you can consider if your cat is in fact depressed."

[9] X Research source Feline Behavior for the Veterinarian. Bonnie Beaver. WB Saunders. 2nd edition Introduce a new toy, especially one that triggers natural hunting behavior like a mouse on a string. Be patient if she does not react right away. Start by putting the toy near her paw and jerking it to encourage hunting behavior. Do this for five minutes, even if your cat doesn't respond. The fact that you are giving her your undivided attention will make an impression on her. Once she starts to play, this will engage her hypothalamus and send out hormones that are beneficial for counteracting depression. An active cat is a happy cat."

But the room diffuser is probably most useful for your depressed cat because you can plug the diffuser unit into an electrical socket in the room where your cat spends most of her time. As the cat sleeps, she will breathe in the pheromone. Don't worry, these diffusers are odorless to people and have no effect on humans."

Bonnie Beaver. WB Saunders. 2nd edition Before using these supplements, consult a veterinarian who prescribes them to cats a regular basis. Just because a supplement is not a prescription drug doesn't mean it is free of side effects. The nutraceutical Zylkene has been developed to decrease stress in cats. As stress is a major cause of feline depression, decreasing this can help get your cat back on her paws. Zylkene contains a molecule derived from milk, which acts on the brain receptors. It has a similar calming effect to certain prescription medications but with fewer potential side effects. This will help to soothe your cat’s anxiety and reduce her fears, both of which are powerful drivers for depression. The effect of nutraceuticals are not rapid, so it can take up to seven days before you notice any clear differences in your depressed kitty. Zylkene comes as a capsule. The dose for an average-sized cat is one 75mg capsule once a day."
