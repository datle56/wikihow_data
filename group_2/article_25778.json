    {
      "title": "Learn the principle of a counter-attack.",
      "content": "Learn the principle of a counter-attack. Form V is all about redirecting your opponents attacks back at them, and attacking immediately after defending."

      "title": "Decide whether you should study Djem-So or Shien.",
      "content": "Decide whether you should study Djem-So or Shien. Shien is more useful for fighting blaster-wielding opponents such as droids or bounty hunters. Djem-So focuses more on using physical strength to dominate a lightsaber duel. Bear in mind that some Jedi frown upon Djem-So as being not in keeping with the Jedi code."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know the difference between Shien and Soresu.",
      "content": "Know the difference between Shien and Soresu . Shien is very similar to Soresu, in that it uses similar moves to deflect blaster bolts. The main difference with Shien, though, is that the blaster bolts are deflected in such a way that they either: Return to, and hit, the person who fired them; Hit another opponent; or Damage the environment in such a way that is disadvantageous to your opponent (e.g. destroy an overhang and bury them under a pile of rubble)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Try using a reversed grip when using Shien.",
      "content": "Try using a reversed grip when using Shien. This makes it easier to perform large, sweeping moves, in the manner of throwing a punch. Some, however, frown on this style. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use counter-attacks to disrupt the enemy.",
      "content": "Use counter-attacks to disrupt the enemy. If you're on the defensive, counter-attack your opponent after they make an attack. This should help to put you on the offensive. Then, use repeated power attacks to keep your opponent on the defensive and batter them down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Once you're on the offensive, use strong, powerful, brute-force attacks to batter down your opponent.",
      "content": "Once you're on the offensive, use strong, powerful, brute-force attacks to batter down your opponent. Djem-So is all about dominating the duel using (Force-enhanched) strength. For this reason, some of the more pacifist Jedi frown upon it."

    {
      "title": "Use an attack called the Falling Avalanche.",
      "content": "Use an attack called the Falling Avalanche. This attack is special to Djem So. The handle is held behind the head withe blade pointing downwards or backwards. The lightsaber is then swung up and over the head, and down onto the opponent, with as much force as you can muster. This attack is very useful for breaking an opponents defense."

      "content": "Djem So: the blade is held above the head, angled backwards and down at about 45 degrees. This is also the beginning stance for the Falling Avalanche attack."
