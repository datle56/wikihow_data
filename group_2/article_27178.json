      "title": "Make this for an emergency mixed drink ingredient.",
      "content": "Make this for an emergency mixed drink ingredient. Some bartenders use this substitute when there's no ginger ale in stock. It's not intended to be an amazing drink by itself, or to be drunk straight. Don't assume the customer is fine with the substitute. Let them know you would have to use a soda replacement, and give them the option to change the order."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start with a glass of ice.",
      "content": "Start with a glass of ice. As always, mix in a glass of ice to keep the ingredients cold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a couple dashes of bitters.",
      "content": "Add a couple dashes of bitters. This adds a spicy aroma and taste to replace the ginger bite. You may use Angostura bitters, or whatever you have on hand. Bitters are alcoholic. Skip this step if you're making the drink for kids or non-drinkers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a splash of sour mix.",
      "content": "Add a splash of sour mix. Most prepackaged sour mixes taste terrible. Make this simple recipe yourself for best results: Make simple syrup by combining equal amounts of sugar and water. Heat and stir until all sugar is dissolved, then let cool. To make sour mix, combine two parts simple syrup and three parts lemon or lime juice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the glass mostly full of lemon-lime soda.",
      "content": "Pour the glass mostly full of lemon-lime soda. At least ¾ of the \"ginger ale\" should be Sprite, 7–Up, or another lemon-lime soda. You can even make it most of the drink, saving just a splash for the remaining ingredients."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the rest with cola.",
      "content": "Fill the rest with cola. The main purpose of the cola is to add a golden color to the clear soda. You only need a splash, but you can add up to ¼ of the glass if you prefer the taste."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add it to the drink.",
      "content": "Add it to the drink. Test your fake ginger ale by mixing it with whiskey, or use it in cocktails such as the Moscow mule. Bartenders typically add the same amount they would regular ginger ale."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try this for a real ginger taste.",
      "content": "Try this for a real ginger taste. If you want a more authentic ginger flavor, you can rely on this recipe instead. Making it at home allows you to adjust the strength to suit your taste."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start with ginger syrup.",
      "content": "Start with ginger syrup. Start with about 2 tbsp (30mL) for a 10-oz (300mL) glass. You can find this ingredient at health food stores, upper end grocery stores, or online. For a fresher taste, make your own: Heat 1 cup (240mL) water and 1¼ cups (240g) sugar, stirring until dissolved. Add ½ cup (120mL) grated or thinly sliced, raw ginger. Simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool, then add 2 tbsp (30mL) lemon juice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the glass with seltzer or soda.",
      "content": "Fill the glass with seltzer or soda. Plain seltzer (fizzy water) is best. You may use lemon-lime soda, cream soda, or other sodas. Sodas add a large amount of sugar and can overpower the ginger taste."

    {
      "title": "Add a few drops of bitters (optional).",
      "content": "Add a few drops of bitters (optional). This alcoholic ingredient will add complex herbal flavors. Try it if you happen to have it on hand, but don't bother buying it if you don't make cocktails at home."

      "title": "Stir and serve.",
      "content": "Stir and serve. Give it a stir until all the ginger syrup has dissolved. Add ice or drink it straight."
