The surface of the stellated icosahedron is made up of a number of pyramids (in fact, if you take the regular icosahedron - a solid with twenty triangular faces - and make each face the base of a triangular pyramid, you get a stellated icosahedron). So we start by using the units to make a series of connected pyramids. To get a more simple idea of this complex cube you are now going to build, just think of an only 12-faced regular pentagonal dodecahedron (a Platonic solid), and imagine each of its 20 vertices (5 at the top, 5 at the bottom and 10 around in-between) will be replaced by a pyramid. With 30 units you will shape together those 20 pyramids."
