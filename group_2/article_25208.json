This will give you a good idea of which size hat to knit. You can also choose a hat size based on how high you want the hat to be. Follow these size recommendations to make a hat that fits your child well: Preemie: 10 in (25 cm) circumference and 6 inches (15 cm) high Newborn: 12 in (30 cm) circumference and 7 inches (18 cm) high 6-month old: 14 in (36 cm) circumference and 8 inches (20 cm) high 1-year old: 16 in (41 cm) circumference and 9 inches (23 cm) high Toddler: 18 in (46 cm) circumference and 9 1 ⁄ 2 inches (24 cm) high"

Keep in mind that you'll only need about 1/2 to 2 ounces (40 to 160 yards) of the yarn so this is a great project for using up yarn from your stash.

Then, slide the index and thumb of your other hand under and through the loop. Use these fingers to pinch the working yarn and pull it through the loop. [2] X Research source If you continue to pull, you'll make the knot with a small loop at the end. If you kept pulling this, the knot would unravel or slip away."

Once you've made the slip knot, put it onto 1 of your circular needles and pull the yarn tail until the stitch is secure. If you don't want to use circular needles, put the slip knot on double-pointed needles of the same size.

To join the round, knit a stitch to connect the first and last stitches that you cast on.
