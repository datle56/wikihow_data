      "title": "Bring the sugar, water, and lemon juice to a boil in a saucepan.",
      "content": "Bring the sugar, water, and lemon juice to a boil in a saucepan. Start by adding 1 cup (240 mL) of water to create a liquid base in the pan. Then mix in 1 ½ cups (345 g) of granulated sugar and the juice from half of a lemon. Do this over a medium-high heat, and continuously stir the mixture to keep the sugar from burning.

      "title": "Lower to a medium-low heat and allow the mixture to simmer for 3-5 minutes.",
      "content": "Lower to a medium-low heat and allow the mixture to simmer for 3-5 minutes. Keep stirring the mixture as it simmers. When it is ready, remove the pan from the heat. The liquid will look clear and the granules of sugar will be completely dissolved. [3] X Research source Continue to simmer the mixture if the granules are not dissolved after 5 minutes. As long as you stir, the liquid will not burn and the taste won’t be altered. However, the longer you simmer the mixture, the thicker the consistency will be after it cools."

      "title": "Transfer the syrup into a sealable glass bowl and store it in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Transfer the syrup into a sealable glass bowl and store it in the refrigerator. Let the syrup rest 1-2 minutes in the pan, and then pour it into a glass bowl that has a lid and put it in the refrigerator. While in the refrigerator, the syrup will thicken considerably as it cools off. Leave the syrup in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. [4] X Research source Add additional flavorings to the lemon-simple syrup before it cools completely while resting in the pan. Consider adding 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of rose water or 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of vanilla extract to reduce the tangy taste of the lemon. Leave the syrup as is if you want a stronger, lemony flavor. [5] X Research source If you are not planning to make the kunafa dough the same day as the simple syrup, add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of corn syrup before placing it in the refrigerator to maintain the smoothness of the simple syrup. The syrup will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week."

      "content": "Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C) to save yourself waiting time later. Make sure the racks in the oven are clear of any baking pans or trays. Place the oven rack along the center rung in the oven, so your kunafa does not cook to close to the top or bottom of the oven. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Grease a cake pan with melted butter to keep the dough from sticking.",
      "content": "Grease a cake pan with melted butter to keep the dough from sticking. The cake pan can be whatever shape you want—square, circle, or rectangle—but aim to have the cake pan at least 2 in (5.1 cm) deep. This will give your dough enough room to rise. You can also use a deep-dish pizza pan if you do not have a cake pan that is deep enough. [7] X Research source For a traditional shape, use a standard round cake pan that is 12 in (30 cm) in diameter and 2 in (5.1 cm) deep. Instead of butter, you can use olive oil to grease the pan.

      "content": "Mix 1 lb (454 g) of kataifi dough and 1 cup (225 g) of melted butter in a bowl. Use your fingers to break up the clumped strands of kataifi dough before adding the melted butter. Then thoroughly toss the pastry dough strands with your fingers until they are evenly coated with the melted butter. [9] X Research source Kataifi dough is thin strands of phyllo pastry dough, and can be purchased in Middle Eastern or Greek markets, or in the world food section of your local grocery store.

      "content": "Decorate the bottom of the greased cake pan with blanched almonds. Arrange the almonds into the shape of a flower or starburst for a traditional look, or have fun creating a design unique to you. Lay the almonds to look like a spiral or shape the almonds into a letter to represent someone’s name. [11] X Research source Aim to use no more than ¼ cup (40 g) of blanched almonds. This way, the flavors will remain balanced throughout the dessert and you will not just be eating a mouthful of almonds."

      "title": "Press half of the kataifi dough into the decorated pan.",
      "content": "Press half of the kataifi dough into the decorated pan. Use your fingertips to gently spread the dough out until it is even. Do not plop the dough or press it against the bottom of the pan too firmly; otherwise, you may disturb the almond design or overwork the dough. [12] X Research source You do not have to have an exact measurement of dough in the bottom of the pan. Just use your best judgment to divide the dough in half."

      "title": "Add a layer of creamy pudding, ricotta, or mozzarella for the filling.",
      "content": "Add a layer of creamy pudding, ricotta, or mozzarella for the filling. The ingredients used in the creamy filling of the kunafa vary, so choose a filling texture or taste that appeals to you the most. Experiment with the amount that you use, but avoid using more than 1 lb (453 g) of the filling. To make the classic creamy pudding filling, boil 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of milk or cream. Then add 1/8 tsp (0.29 g) of sugar and cornstarch, and stir the mixture until it thickens. [13] X Research source Instead of a creamy filling, opt for a dairy-free, crunchy filling. Mix together 2 cups (240 g) of chopped walnuts or pistachios, 2 ½ tbsp (22.5 g) granulated sugar or brown sugar, ½ cup (75 g) of golden raisins, and 2 tsp (4.6 g) of ground cinnamon. Then evenly layer the mixture onto the dough. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Take the remaining dough and press it evenly over the filling.",
      "content": "Take the remaining dough and press it evenly over the filling. Make the top layer of dough as even as possible so the pastry cooks evenly. Gently, spread it out with your fingers until it covers the inside of the pan and none of the filling is showing. Be careful not to press so hard that you cause the filling to overflow."

      "content": "Bake the pastry in the oven at 350 °F (177 °C) for 30-45 minutes. Check on the kunafa to see if the crust has a golden coloring that resembles the color of cornbread. The golden color indicates that it is done cooking. [15] X Research source If the kunafa does not have any golden coloring, let it continue baking and check on it every 1-2 minutes."

      "title": "Pour the lemon simple syrup on the kunafa and let it rest for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Pour the lemon simple syrup on the kunafa and let it rest for 10 minutes. The warm pastry will melt the syrup into a thin glaze. Allow the kunafa to cool off before removing it from the pan. This will also give the syrup a chance to soak into the pastry. [16] X Research source Use a spatula to help spread the syrup around the surface of the kunafa. Since the syrup was chilled in the refrigerator, it may be difficult to spread at first."

      "content": "Rest a serving plate on the top of the pan and carefully flip the pan over. Since you greased the pan, the kunafa will slide out and rest on the dish. If you are afraid that the kunafa won’t fall out of the pan, run a thin spatula around the sides of the kunafa before attempting to flip it. [17] X Research source Dairy fillings that have not rested after baking in the oven may have to be cut and served in the pan to keep the filling from running out. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Add additional garnishes that will complement your kunafa before serving. Pick ingredients you may have used inside of your kunafa to garnish it. For a traditional taste, leave the kunafa as is, and enjoy! Some common garnishes are powdered sugar, cinnamon, or pistachios. [19] X Research source Put leftovers in a sealable container, and store them in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can eat the leftovers cold, or reheat them in the oven to maintain the crunch of the crust. To do this, place the leftovers on a pan covered in foil and bake them 10-15 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C). [20] X Research source"
