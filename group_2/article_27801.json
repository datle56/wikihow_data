      "content": "Fill a tall pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. When it comes to making pasta, it doesn't matter how much water you use; you just need enough to submerge the pasta. Err on the safe side and fill the pot about 3/4 full to make sure you have enough. You want it to come to a full, rolling boil before you add the pasta. If you want, you can salt the water to help flavor the pasta. Add a few shakes of salt from your salt shaker. You can also add salt later, after the pasta has cooked, or just enjoy the saltiness of the Alfredo sauce."

      "content": "Cook the pasta for the amount of time indicated on the package. Different types of pasta require different cooking times. In general, it should take eight to ten minutes to finish cooking your pasta. Most people enjoy their pasta \"al dente,\" which means it still has a bit of bite to it, rather than being completely mushy. You can check to see if the pasta is ready by using a fork to pull out a piece and tasting it. If you like the texture, remove it from heat. Or smack a piece of pasta against the wall or another surface. If it sticks, it's ready."

      "content": "Figure out how much Alfredo sauce to use. You'll need the same number of sauce servings as pasta servings. For example, if you made enough pasta for two people, heat enough sauce for two people. Check the nutrition label on the sauce jar to find out how much sauce is in one serving; it should be about 1/4 to 1/2 cup per person."

      "content": "Heat the sauce over medium heat. Place the pan on a burner, turn the burner to medium, and let the sauce begin to heat. Stir it occasionally using a spatula or spoon to keep it from scorching on the bottom. It should take about five minutes to heat. Taste the sauce to see if it's hot before going to the next step."
