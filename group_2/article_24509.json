[1] X Research source Plus, 44% of Amazon sellers reported a good profit margin (above 15%), so selling on Amazon can absolutely be a great side hustle or main business. [2] X Research source To lay the groundwork for that kind of success, here's what to do: Save up at least $500-$5000 (depending on the products you sell) to cover inventory, storage fees, seller fees, and marketing.

If you join the Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) program, you never have to give inventory or shipping orders a second thought. Amazon takes care of all those logistical concerns for you.

      "content": "Amazon makes marketing your products and finding customers easier. Amazon lets you choose how to help people find your products: using ads or their algorithmic search engine. Having options with different price ranges helps you stay within your marketing budget and optimize your advertising campaign until you find the ad types that generate the highest return. [8] X Research source For example, you can optimize your product listings with keywords and let Amazon's search algorithms direct customers to your products through their queries. This method isn't guaranteed to help you rank higher in search results, however, and you'll likely face a lot of stiff competition from other sellers. Alternatively, you can pay extra to buy Amazon Ads and reach new customers both on and off the Amazon platform. This strategy may help you bypass some of your competitors in the search results ranks."

      "content": "Both FBA and non-FBA sellers must pay for inventory storage. If you opt to fulfill your own products on Amazon, you must purchase your inventory from a wholesaler or manufacturer; store it; and then package and ship orders yourself. In that case, you may have to pay for a storage unit (or several units) to hold all your merchandise. [9] X Research source If you join the FBA program, you'll have to order your inventory, ship it to Amazon, and then pay them a fee to store your merchandise in their warehouses. The average cost of a storage unit in the US ranges from $70-$260 per month depending on the size of the unit. [10] X Research source Amazon charges FBA sellers $0.78 to $1.40 sq cu ft based on the size of the unit and the time of year."

The fee varies depending on the product type and how much it weighs. Whatever the cost, you'll need to raise the prices of your items to generate a profit and cut your losses. Unfortunately, when you raise the price, you risk driving customers away. In the end, it's almost always the sellers who lose. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Customers can ask for refunds for items you sold them for any reason. In general, third-party sellers who fulfill their own orders must manage their customers' refund and return requests . However, if a customer is dissatisfied with a third-party seller's decision on a refund, they can file an A-to-Z Guarantee Refund claim directly with Amazon. [12] X Research source If Amazon approves the claim, the seller has to remit the money for the order back to the customer, regardless of whether they feel the refund is fair. While this policy does protect customers, it can make sellers feel shortchanged â€“ especially if they don't think the customer is asking for a refund for a valid reason (like claiming they didn't receive the package when the tracking information says the delivery was successful)."

      "content": "FBA sellers must pay Amazon fees for fulfillment, storage, and more. Because Amazon fulfills the orders for these sellers, they can charge them a fulfillment fee (per item), a monthly storage fee, a fee for free shipping for items returned by customers, and more. Read the full list of FBA fees below. [13] X Research source Fulfillment fee : A fee Amazon charges per item you sell. It covers packaging and shipping your items, so you don't have to do it yourself. The cost ranges from $2.48 for a 2 oz item to $203.46 for a 150 lb (68 kg) item, with every lb (kg) above 151 lb (68 kg) costing an additional $0.19. Storage fee : A fee for storing your inventory in their warehouses. The price varies depending on the size of your storage unit to the time of year (the storage fee is often 2-3 times higher from October-December than it is from January-September due to the holidays). Aged inventory fee : Amazon charges this fee for your inventory if they have to store in their warehouses for longer than 181 days. Removal, disposal, and liquidation fee : If you decide to dispose of or liquidate any of your inventory, Amazon will do it for you for an extra cost. FBA Inbound placement fee : A charge for a service where Amazon distributes your inventory to fulfillment centers closer to your customers. This allows for faster shipping, which will help you retain customers and maintain Amazon's reputation for timely deliveries."

The referral fee is always a minimum of $0.30 but varies widely depending on the type and size of the product. The seller account fee is either $0.99 per item or $39.99 per month, depending on which option the seller wants to choose. [14] X Research source If you're generating a lot of orders per month, paying $39.99 a month for a professional seller account is both more economical and more beneficial to your business. This plan stays the same price no matter how many products you sell, plus it comes with extra tools and resources to improve your sales and grow your brand. If you're only selling a few items per month, then $0.99 per item may be better suited to your budget."

Amazon offers an advertisement service where you can create and distribute ads on their platform and all over the internet. Choose from the following ad options: [22] X Research source Cost-per-click (CPC) ads : CPC ads include Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, and Sponsored Displays. The way it works is Amazon places your product or brand high in search results or on relevant pages throughout their website. The best part is you only have to pay them when someone clicks on your ad. You also get to set a cap on how much you want to pay overall, so you never exceed your advertising budget. Display & video ads : Display and video ads are only available to sellers who are registered with the Amazon Brand Registry, book vendors, and vendors and agencies with clients. It's a long, splashy ad that stretches across the webpage. Amazon displays it on its platform as well as on other sites the company owns, like Twitch and iMDB. Cost-per-mille (CPM) audio ads : These ads are 10-60-second-long commercials that air on Amazon's podcast and streaming services like Alexa News, Twitch, and Amazon Music. They can even reach radio show listeners through the Amazon Publisher Direct (APD) network. For this type of ad, you must pay a certain cost per 1000 impressions of your ad (\"mille\" means \"thousand\")."
