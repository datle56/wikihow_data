You don’t have to list all their faults, but make sure you’re prepared with specific and honest reasons about why you don’t like them.

[10] X Research source If you’ve only known them for a few weeks, you can say, “I think you’re a good person, but you and I have completely different interests, friend groups, and lifestyles. I’d rather just go our separate ways.” [11] X Research source If you’ve known the person for longer, organize your thoughts beforehand.

[14] X Research source Try to write them an email instead of talking to them in-person, this way you won’t have to be alone with them. Try to address your concerns as they come up.
