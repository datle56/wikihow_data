      "title": "Get plenty of aerobic exercise.",
      "content": "Get plenty of aerobic exercise. We think of the brain’s processing speed similarly to how electrical signals travel across wiring connections. In the brain, these wiring connections are called axons. The brain's white matter is made up of all of this wiring and is fed by blood vessels, meaning that vascular problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure can starve the axons of much-needed oxygen and glucose. Therefore, staying fit and getting plenty of aerobic exercise is the number one suggestion by most neurologists to sustain axons and even potentially improve processing speeds.

Aerobic exercise—getting your heart rate up gets blood flow to the brain—which helps the brain recover.”"

Avocados are high in fat, so limit yourself to a quarter or half an avocado a day. Blueberries: Blueberries are packed with antioxidants, which means they protect the brain from oxidative stress and may reduce the effects of age-related conditions. Aim for 1 cup (16 US tbsp) of blueberries per day.

Deep-water fish such as salmon, sardines, and herring are full of them. Aim to eat a 4 ounces (110 g) serving 2 to 3 times per week.

      "content": "Get the proper amount of sleep each night. The National Institutes of Health recommends that adults get approximately 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night and that teenagers get 9 hours. The brain forms new pathways while you sleep, and studies have shown that getting the right amount of sleep helps with learning, problem-solving skills, and memory. Sleep also plays a role in the body’s repair of the heart and blood vessels, which fuel the white matter of the brain.

      "content": "Keep learning new things. Well into adulthood, the brain continues making new connections. Learning a task builds new connections, and mastering those connections strengthens the connections in a way that makes the information travel across axons more quickly. [12] X Research source More specifically, when you learn, types of brain cells called glial cells can form sheaths of protein and fatty substances (called myelin sheaths) around axons that insulate the axons and subsequently speed electrical signals down them. [13] X Research source Learning new skills can both increase myelin sheaths as well as form sheaths around formerly bare axons. Thicker myelin sheaths can improve a number of brainy tasks from reading to creating memories to decision-making.

The belief is that because musical training involves so many specific coordinations—visual to read music, auditory to listen to what you’re playing, and motor to finger the instrument—the connections between these brain areas become stronger and more tightly connected.

Try your hand at this brain game by opening a large, clear version of the above image. The rise in popularity of brain games is too new for any long-term studies to prove specific improvements of brain function; however, many people feel that brain games have helped with their cognition. As Lewis reiterates, no game or activity is better than another. At the end of the day, “any is better than none.”"

      "content": "Start over from the face’s perspective. Once you’ve gotten quick at calling the directions, try calling the directions from the face’s perspective instead—as if you were the face looking out from the page. This approach is more difficult because it requires one additional processing step to correct for the face’s perspective. As with the first trial, time yourself and try to complete the picture without error at different milestones—30 seconds, then 15 seconds."

Return to the exercise from step 2, but this time, point your finger in the opposite direction of the one you’re saying aloud for each face: “down [point up], left [point right], up [point down]…” This one will be even more difficult because you’ve added a motor skill component to the verbal component. Similar to the idea behind why musical training can improve processing speed, this exercise requires the coordination of multiple brain modalities—visual to interpret the information in the picture, verbal to say the direction aloud, and motor to point in coordination with the rest. You can also continue adding more components to the exercises. For instance, calling out the face’s perspective direction only when you reach green faces or on every third face."
