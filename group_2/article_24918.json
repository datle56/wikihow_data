      "content": "A 2021 study showed feeling desired is important for men's sexual satisfaction. For the vast majority of the men who participated in the study (a whopping 95%), \"feeling desired\" ranked as very important. Some even said it was more important to them than basic physical needs like eating and sleeping. The easiest way to help him feel desired is to tell him—whether it's face-to-face or through a sexy little text. [1] X Research source For example, as he's on the way home from work, send him a flirty text and say something like, \"I've been thinking all day about your body next to mine. I crave your touch.\" While the two of you are out together, you might lean close and whisper in his ear, \"I forgot how hot you look in that suit—I just want to devour you.\""

Channeling some of that energy into your married life will help increase his sexual and overall satisfaction in the relationship. [2] X Research source This could be as subtle as a light touch on his arm as you're talking or a brief squeeze as you brush past him in the kitchen. Rest your hand on his arm as you're reading something together or on his leg when you're in the car. Think back to how you might touch someone when you were flirting with them and trying to get their attention, then touch your husband in some of the same ways. The same facial expressions and looks work too! A fleeting, meaningful glance can make him feel the same way your hand brushing his chest or lingering on his arm would. Kissing and cuddling in bed at night, even if you're not going to have sex, helps sustain your physical and emotional bond.

      "content": "Taking the lead shows him that you're enthusiastic and you want him. Remember: feeling desired is very important for men's sexual satisfaction. If he's always the one who initiates sex, he has no way of knowing if you really want it or just go along with it when he brings it up. Embrace the vulnerability that comes with getting the ball rolling not knowing if he'll reciprocate. [4] X Research source There are ways you can ease into this if you're kind of shy about initiating sex . For example, you might send him a teasing text like, \"I might have a surprise for you tonight in the bedroom... if you're up for it.\" Sending a sexy photo can also work to kick off something sexual. For example, you might tie a ribbon around yourself, text him a picture, and say, \"You have a present... but you have to unwrap it.\" This is also a good way to improve your own satisfaction. If you're taking the lead, you can show him exactly how you like to be touched.

The best way to initiate a surprise quickie is to catch him at a time when he'd normally be down for sex but isn't expecting it at the moment. Then, just start making out with him and let things go from there. [6] X Research source For example, if he likes morning sex, you might set your alarm for 10 minutes early and wake him up with kisses and gentle caresses of his body. You can also initiate a quickie with a text. For example, if you're at home and know he has a lunch break coming up, you might text him, \"I have a special lunch for you... but you'll have to come home to get it.\" When he comes home, you can be waiting naked or in some lingerie he likes."

If talking dirty isn't something you feel super comfortable with, start with more vague, PG-rated comments, such as \"I love it when you put your hand there,\" or \"You feel so good.\" You can always ramp it up from there. [7] X Research source Remember that he wants to feel desired, so focus on what you love about him and make it seem like you just can't get enough of him. For example, you might say, \"Your body against mine makes me so hot,\" or \"I can't get enough of how you feel inside me.\" As long as you're both comfortable with it, try watching pornography together to get some good ideas for dirty talk."

There are other ways you can show that he's making you feel good: your muscles tensing, grabbing him or a nearby object, lightly scratching him, or breathing heavily. [8] X Research source Don't be afraid to use your words as well! For example, you might say, \"That feels so good\" or \"I love when you do that\" or \"Please don't stop.\" If you have a vagina, know that faking orgasms isn't doing anyone any favors. At best, all you do is teach him that whatever he was doing was working when it definitely wasn't."

[9] X Research source Treat sex as an exciting activity that you and your partner both participate in and be on the lookout for different ways you can make it even more fun. [10] X Research source There's science behind this, too. Multiple studies show that couples who make an effort to try new and different things in the bedroom report higher levels of sexual desire and greater sexual satisfaction.

For example, many people experiment with roleplay to spice up their sex lives. But here's the thing about roleplay: It's actually really hard to convincingly do! You might end up collapsing in a fit of giggles—and that's okay. It just gives you another opportunity to bond with each other."

You can turn anything you have lying around the house into a sex toy (just make sure it's clean first). For example, you might tie your partner to the bed with neckties and tease him with a feather. Go slow so you have time to notice all the different erogenous zones on his body."

The science behind pillow talk is that having an orgasm floods your system with oxytocin, a hormone that gives you warm, fuzzy feelings of love and trust. It makes you want to open up to your partner and share your thoughts and feelings. [15] X Research source A 2020 study showed having more pillow talk results in men specifically feeling more satisfied with their relationships.

Can we talk about it? Your satisfaction is really important to me.\" Sex is a \"taboo\" or \"forbidden\" topic in a lot of cultures and communities, so it's understandable that you might feel shy or embarrassed about this at first.

But if you and your husband are having a conversation about sex, the things you don't like are going to come up. [19] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I really love when you touch me. If you used your tongue as well, it would really take me over the top. That would make our sex even more amazing than it already is.\" Everybody likes different things in bed—there's no \"one size fits all\" when it comes to sex. Remember that your husband is the ultimate authority of what pleases him. If you want him to be sexually satisfied, what he says is more important than what you've read in a magazine, seen in a video, or done with other men. To accept this kind of criticism, you have to allow yourself to be vulnerable—and that can be tough. You might feel the urge to get defensive, but try to have empathy for your husband and see things from his point of view. [20] X Research source Accepting his criticism and making changes to better please him also makes him feel more desired. You're showing him that you're sexually attracted to him and want to please him. [21] X Research source"

To set the scene, you might start by texting him a picture of the costume laid out on the bed and say something like, \"Are you ready for your physical tonight? I plan to give you a thorough examination.\" Don't be afraid to share your own fantasies as well. Many men are going to enjoy fulfilling your fantasies as much as you enjoy fulfilling theirs. You might even find that you have some fantasies in common. For example, you might have a fantasy of being tied up and helpless, and he might have a fantasy of rescuing a \"damsel in distress.\" Those two fantasies can definitely work together! You can share your thoughts and feelings with each other. Try to make time for having fun together. Make an effort to be playful and find something that works for the two of you as a couple."

The idea of penciling in sex on your calendar might sound really un-sexy, but it shows that sex is just as important to you as the other things you make time for. It also keeps other things from getting in the way of having sex. [23] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Scheduling a specific time for sex requires you to schedule other things around it, rather than the other way around. This is a great thing to try if you find that sex keeps getting pushed to the side in favor of other things you need to do. This doesn't mean that, when the time comes, you have to have sex even if you don't want to. Your libido might not always match up with your calendar—and that's okay. Instead, spend that time relaxing and holding each other."

When you do that, studies show, your passion and sexual desire for each other start to decrease. You can keep this from happening by making sure that each of you has your own things that you do separate from each other. [26] X Research source For example, you might each take a separate class one night a week, or join rec league teams in different sports. Spending time apart can be just as important as spending quality time together. Additionally, it turns out the old saying that \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\" actually holds some truth. When your partner's not around, your imagination kicks in and they become more desirable—so you might plan solo weekend getaways, then get ready for a hot reunion. [27] X Research source"
