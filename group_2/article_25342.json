You might find yourself checking your ex’s page, or interacting with them online even while you still harbor feelings for them, good or bad. That’s a sign that you’re still tethered to an old flame. If seeing your ex online still stirs feelings, consider unfollowing or blocking them, or even taking a break from social media until those feelings pass.
