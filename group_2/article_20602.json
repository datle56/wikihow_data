[32] X Research source Capricorn – Quiet, unassuming Capricorn can be easily overwhelmed by loud and flashy Aries. They’re also both incredibly stubborn cardinal signs. Compromise is the key to learning from each other and making this relationship work. [33] X Research source Pisces – Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and Pisces is the last, making this pairing a little awkward. Aries is direct and driven, while Pisces likes to go with the flow. They can be a successful pairing if they learn to see the world from the other’s perspective. [34] X Research source"
