      "title": "Remove the meat from the fridge at least 30 minutes before cooking.",
      "content": "Remove the meat from the fridge at least 30 minutes before cooking. Letting the meat warm up to room temperature prevents a temperature shock that makes the outsides of the ribs cook much faster than the inside. Think of the bones like mini ice cubes, staying cold for much longer than the meat, and you'll see why letting the whole thing warm up a bit before cooking is so important. [1] X Research source Continue with the dry rub and prep work while they warm up -- you just don't want to put the ribs in the oven before 30-60 minutes."

      "content": "Cut the thin, silvery membrane off the back of the ribs with a small knife. It can be a bit sticky, but it should peel off with a little prying. Cut a long slit along the top of the membrane and pull down, along the bones, to peel it away. This membrane is not only tough to chew, it prevents your flavors from penetrating the meat."

      "content": "Mix up all of the ingredients to make your dry rub. The dry rub is more than just seasoning -- the salt and sugar work together to help retain the meat's moisture, which is essential to fall off the bone ribs. Whisk all of these spices and sugars together evenly with a fork. You can use the dry rub recipe above, or purchase your own directly from the store. When possible, use some specialty \"smoked salt\" to get an impressively smoky flavor."

Don't be shy-- use a generous amount of your spice and sugar mixture and cover the ribs by rubbing it into the meat. If you're going to be grilling or smoking your ribs or want to make your own sauce, set aside 3 tablespoons dry rub before starting."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 250F/120C. For the juiciest ribs, you want a slow, even cooking temperature for the first few hours, which cooks the meat slowly while retaining moisture. While accomplished cooks can master this art with a smoker or large grill, it is far easier to use your oven. These ribs can either be finished in the oven or on a grill, meaning you can still get delicious smokey flavor after tenderizing the meat in the oven"

First, they provide liquid for the steam, which helps keep the meat moist as it cooks.

If they are already tender, crank up the oven. [5] X Research source If you'd like to finish the ribs on the grill, go set the burners to high and then click here for the rest of the recipe.

Depending on your grill, there are different ways to do this: Charcoal and wood-fired grills should be set up so that half of the grill is covered in briquets and the other half is empty. Slow and steady is the way to go for ribs that fall easily from the bones. Propane grillers can simply turn on 1 burner and leave 1-2 burners off. If you have a second, higher rack on the grill, this can work too. [8] X Research source"
