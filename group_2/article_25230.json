      "content": "Get into the proper position to throw a temple punch. To throw a punch with your right hand, place your left leg in front of you and your right leg back. Your knees should be slightly bent. [1] X Research source Self-defense specialist Derrek Hofrichter suggests taking a fighting stance where “your dominant side is in the rear and you take a slight step forward with your non-dominant side. A right-handed person would have their left foot out in front and the right foot behind. Then, you're going to add a slight 45-degree angle, so instead of your feet just being totally forward, you'll slightly angle them inward.” [2] X Expert Source Derrek Hofrichter Self-Defense Specialist Expert Interview. 26 January 2021."

      "content": "Try to relax your body before making a move. Make sure your body is loose, which will increase your momentum and the force of your hit. Release any tightness you feel in your shoulders, arms, hips, and legs. This is called the “guard” position. Don’t hold your breath, but instead, focus on your breathing. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Aim for your opponent’s temple with a hook.",
      "content": "Aim for your opponent’s temple with a hook. To deliver a hook, keep your non-dominant hand in an upright “guard” position near your face. Then, bend your punching arm at the elbow slightly more than 90 degrees while keeping your forearm raised. Turn your torso, back leg, and heel at the same time you deliver the hook to the temple. [4] X Research source This punch will cause the brain to swing violently against the skull lining, so your opponent experiences a blackout. The area is referred to as a pressure point on the head since hitting someone there disorients them. A hook is a punch thrown to the side of your opponent’s body, including their ear, temple, or jaw. The temple is the area on the side of a person's face, between the hairline and the eyebrows, at eye level. It’s located 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) behind and just above the eye."

      "content": "Use your hips to generate force, not just your arms. Generate more force with a hit by twisting your hips while you move toward the target. If you want to put more force into your swing, be sure to use your hips as well as your arms. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your two largest knuckles to punch.",
      "content": "Use your two largest knuckles to punch. Try to hit with just your two largest knuckles instead of the smaller knuckles of the ring finger and pinky. Many boxers make the mistake of hitting with all four knuckles and wind up with broken hands. Karate practitioners use and condition the two large knuckles to avoid that problem and concentrate all that force into a smaller area. If you hit the ribs with all four knuckles, it dissipates the force. If you hit the ribs with just the two large knuckles, it concentrates the force and breaks the ribs. Self-defense trainer Adrian Tandez notes that “there is a big difference between punching with gloves on versus punching without gloves. The chances of you breaking your hands in a bare-knuckle fight are very high. When you throw a punch , it has to be safe, it has to be aligned properly, and you have to hit with the right part of your knuckles.” [6] X Expert Source Adrian Tandez Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 24 July 2019."

      "title": "Strike your opponent with your closed fist and follow through.",
      "content": "Strike your opponent with your closed fist and follow through. It's sometimes easier to use the palm of your hand for hitting, but in this case, your fist will be more accurate. Aiming at the side of the person's face and hitting them from that angle is extremely hard to do with force when only using the palm. When punching the temple, be careful because it can kill someone due to the brain being severely damaged. Only use the amount of force that is necessary. Self defense trainer Tsahi Shemesh recommends always being the one to hit first in a fight. “You can’t avoid the fight and are going to get hit anyway. Do you prefer to be the one that gets hit or the one that hits first? If the fight is a fact, you want to be the one that has the element of surprise.” [7] X Expert Source Tsahi Shemesh Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 17 Sep 2019."

Martial artist and self-defense trainer David Engel states that “after your opponent has thrown a strike is when they're most vulnerable. If you can slip or bob and weave an opponent's punch, their jaw will likely be in the air, and their shoulder will be down instead of protecting their jaw. That would be the best time to throw a knockout punch.” [9] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020."

      "content": "Aim for the jaw or the middle of the chin. Uppercuts and sideswipes are the 2 best punches to use when hitting your opponent in the jaw or chin to cause a knockout. For an uppercut, target the jaw by coming straight up with your fist and minimizing any lateral movement. Ideally, you want the recipient's head to snap straight up after you hit them with an uppercut. To sideswipe the chin, target the jaw with your fist by coming in from a side angle. After you hit them, you want your opponent’s head to snap to the side (and hopefully cause a blackout)."

Baseball players also use this strategy to generate more force when they swing the bat. [11] X Research source Martial artist Danny Zelig believes you should hit areas in the body that your opponent will find difficult to block. “If you have an option to strike to the stomach or strike to the groin—and the strike to the stomach will give you a 40% chance to stop the attacker, but the same attack to the groin will be 41%—go with the 1% more. Work on specific targeting, like groin, poking the eye, throat, and areas that give you a better chance to stop a bigger, stronger attacker .” [12] X Expert Source Dany Zelig Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 13 August 2019."

What you’re doing is “hooking” your leg around your opponent’s head to strike their jaw—specifically, aim for the area of your opponent's face just below the jaw. Your entire body should spin along with your kicking leg as you strike their jaw with force. This is called a hook or spinning hook kick. Expect that your opponent will snap their head back and fall off-balance. Be careful, this can cause the other person to lose consciousness."

When you hit very fast and hard, this only increases the chances of your brain rattling, which leads to a blackout. [14] X Research source"
