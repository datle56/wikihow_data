      "content": "Many banned users report that this is the most effective solution. Snapchat can detect the IP address of the device you used to create your account. This means that if you try to make a new account on your current phone or mobile device, it may end up getting blocked again. To get around this issue, install Snapchat on a completely new device and set up a new username and password. Some users report that it doesn’t matter if you use the same phone number or email to create your new Snapchat, as long as you’re using a different phone or tablet to create your account."
