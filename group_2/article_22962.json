      "title": "Geminis shut people out when they're hurt.",
      "content": "Geminis shut people out when they're hurt. His talkative and lively personality can suddenly dim after an argument or disagreement. This is how he copes, bottling up his feelings until he can't close the lid anymore. [1] X Research source With Mercury ruling his nature, a Gemini man prefers to be unemotional and avoid confronting his difficult feelings‚Äîbut he'll talk when he's ready! Try not to egg him on if he's uncharacteristically quiet after an argument. Instead, let him have his space but talk to him periodically. This will give him time to think through his emotions \"and\" provide many opportunities to talk when he's ready."

      "title": "The smart but erratic Gemini may need time to think.",
      "content": "The smart but erratic Gemini may need time to think. Asking for time alone and removing himself from the situation might be his way of sorting through what's happened. Whether it was an argument or he just received bad news, sometimes he wants to think things through before sharing how he feels. Remember, he's an air sign ruled by Mercury and the 3rd House, which means he's extremely intelligent and thinks practically before thinking emotionally. Try not to bring up what's hurt him until he comes to you. This will show him that you respect his boundaries and are someone he can rely on."

      "title": "A Gemini man can be very protective about his feelings.",
      "content": "A Gemini man can be very protective about his feelings. Although the messenger planet Mercury governs his world, he can have a hard time expressing difficult emotions. Because of this, he may give you the cold shoulder if he's hurt. Give him space to think and work things out, and, in time, he'll come to you. Communicate with him to appease the Mercury in him. Even if he's not reciprocating your affections right now, he eventually will. Geminis need a smart and surprising partner, so send him a short text to remind him how much you care. Try something like, \"Saw some apples at the store and thought of you ‚ù§Ô∏è\" or, \"Good morning! I hope today's a better day. I'm here when you need me üòä‚ù§Ô∏è\""

      "title": "Practical Gemini will brush off concerns if he's seriously hurt.",
      "content": "Practical Gemini will brush off concerns if he's seriously hurt. The last thing he wants is confrontation, and if that means going the extra mile and pretending like nothing ever happened, he'll do it. He might also do this if he's keeping what's hurting him a secret to avoid hurting you. Either way, he'll go with his mutable modality and adjust his life around his pain. [2] X Research source This behavior is normal for a Gemini man, so be patient . He'll reveal the cause of his stress with time. Offer support emotionally and physically. That could be an extra hug before he heads off to work or school or letting him complain about an upcoming assignment."

      "title": "Impulsive Geminis can explode before they have time to think.",
      "content": "Impulsive Geminis can explode before they have time to think. More often than not, he'll speak before he thinks if he's hurt. Sometimes the emotions can be too much for a Gemini to bear. As an air sign, his mood changes as often as the breeze, so give him a chance to cool down and think rationally again. [3] X Research source A Gemini's dual nature is symbolized by twins and represents the exchange of thoughts and ideas. He has two personalities, and when he's hurt or overwhelmed, one can overpower the other. Try to remain calm and level-headed if he bursts. Having patience will go a long way in keeping the relationship alive."

      "title": "Curious Geminis can lash out if they're upset.",
      "content": "Curious Geminis can lash out if they're upset. A lot is going on in that big brain of his, and with so many ideas coming and going, he can quickly lose his temper. His otherwise playful expressions can turn hostile, and he may not even realize it. Stay calm and collected when he's like this. If you feel like you're about to lose your temper, take a few deep breaths and remove yourself from the situation. Things will cool down with time, and he'll appreciate your patience."

      "title": "A Gemini man would rather forget what happened than be vulnerable.",
      "content": "A Gemini man would rather forget what happened than be vulnerable. Even though Mercury is his ruling planet, communicating his feelings can sometimes be difficult, especially if he's hurting. He'd rather bottle them up than show he's \"weak,\" so he'll ignore the situation until the pain disappears. He may not want to talk, but that doesn't mean you can't be there for him. Your presence is enough to silently say, \"I'm here for you.\" Be patient and don't force him to say anything. He'll explain why he's upset when he's ready."

    {
      "title": "A Gemini's bubbly and curious personality can shut down when hurt.",
      "content": "A Gemini's bubbly and curious personality can shut down when hurt. Suppose you've recently gotten into an argument or disagreement with your Gemini man. In that case, he may start acting cold or distant around you. Trusting someone emotionally can be difficult for an analytical, Mercury-ruled man, so he'll hide his true emotions behind a frosty exterior to avoid being vulnerable. Sorting through these problems as a couple is especially important. Be patient with him and spark a conversation by asking him how he feels. If he doesn't open up right away, that's okay. You can also give him a gentle nudge by expressing your own needs and feelings."

      "title": "A Gemini man will do anything to avoid an emotional situation.",
      "content": "A Gemini man will do anything to avoid an emotional situation. The last thing he wants to do is talk about his feelings. He may be adaptable and expressive, but he can shut down the second he's hurt. To hide this pain, he'll change the topic if you bring it up, pretending like everything's okay even though you both know it's not. This is his Gemini way of coping. Instead of asking, \"What's wrong?\" or, \"Why are you acting this way?\" toss a favorite game, food, or hobby his way. Who knows? He may even start opening up the minute he stops focusing on deflecting the conversation."

    {
      "title": "Inquisitive Gemini will lose interest in his favorite things.",
      "content": "Inquisitive Gemini will lose interest in his favorite things. If he's hurting, he'll shut down mentally and physically. So many emotions and thoughts are zipping through his head, and he'll forget what truly makes him tick. Geminis are naturally opportunistic and take every chance to learn something new, so you might try stimulating his curiosities to remind him who he is. Try bringing him back to his playful self by reminding him of his interests. Set his favorite board game on the table, pop on his favorite movie, or surprise him with tickets to see a sports game."

      "title": "To avoid being vulnerable, a Gemini man might ghost you.",
      "content": "To avoid being vulnerable, a Gemini man might ghost you. He isn't doing this to be mean-spirited, but rather, it seems like the only practical thing he can do in the moment. If he's hurt and thinks he can't trust you, he may avoid your calls, texts, or even leave. Even if he doesn't respond, continue to show him how much you care. Send him apology texts and leave a heartfelt voicemail. With time, he can realize he \"can\" be vulnerable with you and that the relationship is worth more to him than a silly argument."
