      "content": "Provide diapers to maintain cleanliness and prevent over-grooming. Dogs clean themselves while they’re in heat, but constant licking can lead to irritation. Outfitting your dog with diapers can help prevent this and keep your home clean. Change the diaper every 2 to 3 hours, or whenever it’s soiled, and cleanse the area with pet wipes to prevent irritation and infection.

Choose a product labeled for your dog’s size and weight, read the instructions, and place it on your dog as directed. Offer plenty of treats and praise as you put on the diaper to encourage your dog to accept it."

      "content": "Close off hard-to-clean areas of your home, such as carpeted rooms. If your dog is in heat, it could have bloody discharge at the start and end of when it’s in heat. Put up baby gates or close doors to rooms with upholstered furniture, carpets, and other hard-to-clean surfaces to prevent any stains. While it’s experiencing discharge, keep your dog in areas with hard floors and few soft surfaces. [2] X Research source As for your dog’s bed, it’s a good idea to cover it with a machine washable, waterproof lining. Preventing the frustration of accidental messes will help keep both you and dog happy."

      "content": "Enrich your dog's environment to help manage boredom. Your dog will probably spend more time indoors while it's in heat, so take extra steps to keep it entertained. Set aside extra time to play together and offer stimulating puzzle toys to keep it occupied. Give your pooch plenty of affection, but be sure to give it space if it's resting or doesn't feel like playing. [3] X Research source Female dogs in heat tend to get agitated easily. Offering new toys and playing together can help keep your dog entertained and prevent roaming."

      "title": "Bathe",
      "content": "Bathe your dog about once a week if bleeding and discharge are heavy. Dogs in heat tend to be anxious or irritable, so offer plenty of praise and treats while you bathe your pet. Wet it down with lukewarm water, lather its fur with shampoo labeled for dogs, and carefully wipe blood and discharge from its hindquarters with a washcloth. Rinse it thoroughly, then gently dry it with a towel. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If your dog tolerates it, use a blow dryer on a low, cool setting to speed up the process. Try not to bathe your dog more than once a week. It’s a good idea to apply conditioner to prevent skin irritation, especially if you’re bathing your pet more frequently than normal. In between baths, gently clean its genitals and hindquarters with alcohol-free pet wipes. If blood and discharge are minimal, you may be able to stick to the normal bathing routine and simply use wipes to keep it clean."

      "title": "Look for decreased bleeding and swelling within 2 to 4 weeks.",
      "content": "Look for decreased bleeding and swelling within 2 to 4 weeks. Monitor your dog’s genitals and discharge during the course of its cycle. A dog is usually in heat for 3-4 weeks, and your dog will produce discharge for 7-10 days at the beginning and end of the cycle. Watch for the discharge to become gradually lighter in color until it stops altogether. While discharge and enlarged external genitals usually subside within 4 weeks, the cycle may take at least 6 weeks in some dogs. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Your dog ovulates in the middle of the heat cycle so it won’t produce as much discharge, if any at all. Even though it may seem like the heat cycle is over during this middle period, keep your dog in a closed-off area in case it starts discharging again. Call the vet if bleeding or discharge don’t start to improve, or if you notice a foul odor or color other than brown or red. When a female dog is in heat, the external part of its genitals, or the vulva, becomes enlarged. Call the vet if you see body parts with slick, shiny surfaces protruding from the vulva. That may be a sign of medical conditions a vet should examine. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Call the vet if you notice vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. Often enough, stomach upset in dogs subsides quickly and isn’t a major cause for concern. However, schedule a vet appointment promptly if your dog experiences vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, disinterest, or any other unusual symptoms 4 to 8 weeks after it’s finished its cycle. [7] X Research source These symptoms may be signs of pyometra , or infection of the uterus. It requires prompt veterinary care and is typically treated by removing the uterus and other reproductive organs. Pyometra usually occurs within 4 to 8 weeks after the heat cycle ends, but keep in mind it can develop at any point in the heat cycle. If your dog appears to be in heat at an unexpected time, it could also be a symptom of pyometra."

Supervise your dog at all times when you're outside. [9] X Research source Intact male dogs, or males that haven't been neutered, can sense a female in heat up to 5 miles away. Keeping your pet away from roaming males will help keep it safe and prevent unwanted pregnancy."

      "content": "Walk your dog in areas that aren’t frequented by other dogs. Since intact males will be on the lookout for your dog, take precautions when you go on walks and potty breaks. While its in heat, steer clear of any areas where you’ve run into other dogs in the past. Consider letting your dog out to potty only in your fenced-in yard, if you have one. [10] X Research source Additionally, don’t bring your pet to dog parks or other places where it could encounter male dogs that haven't been neutered. Avoid unneutered male dogs even if they’re leashed and with their owner."

      "content": "Ask a friend or relative to watch your male dog if you have one. Even if your intact male is related to your dog that’s in heat, keep them separate. If you don’t have a loved one who can dogsit your male for around 2 to 4 weeks, look into boarding it. If that’s not an option, do your best to keep your dogs out of contact until your female is no longer in heat.

      "content": "Clean up accidents promptly to prevent marking. While urine marking is typically more of a problem in male dogs, female dogs tend to take up the habit when they’re in heat. The best way to prevent marking is to immediately clean any accident spots with an enzymatic pet odor cleaner. [13] X Research source Dogs instinctively mark spots that already carry a scent. If you remove accident odors, your pet will be less tempted to mark indoors. If your dog does attempt to mark, immediately stop it and say “No!” or “Eh-eh!” Then take it outside to relieve itself."

      "content": "Redirect your dog if it tries to mount. While you might associate this behavior with male dogs, female dogs commonly mount while they’re in heat. If your dog mounts you, a guest, or another animal, immediately say “No!” and remove it from whomever or whatever it’s mounting. [14] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source To redirect your dog's attention, grab a treat or toy and command it to sit. Offer the reward as soon as it sits, then practice sitting, lying down, shaking, and any other tricks it knows. In combination, immediately stopping the behavior and redirecting your dog’s attention should discourage mounting."

      "title": "Discourage nesting behavior due to pseudopregnancy, if necessary.",
      "content": "Discourage nesting behavior due to pseudopregnancy, if necessary. Sometimes, female dogs that aren’t allowed to mate experience strong maternal instincts after a heat cycle. They may lactate (produce milk) and try to nurse a “litter” of rolled socks, stuffed animals, and other collected objects. Redirect your pet immediately as soon as you notice any nesting behavior. Take away the collected objects and do a fun activity together. Keep your pet busy with lots of play time, treat-dispensing puzzle toys, and off-leash time in your yard (provided your yard is fenced and its heat cycle is over). If your dog is lactating, its vet can give it medication to stop milk production. Consult the vet or a certified animal behaviorist if nesting behavior persists."
