      "content": "Use baking soda and hydrogen peroxide for an easy home cleaning solution. Sprinkle about ¼ cup (about 50 g) of baking soda over your pan. Then, add 2-3 tbsp (30-44 mL) of hydrogen peroxide a few drops at a time until you get a thick paste. [1] X Research source Let the mixture sit for up to 2 hours. Scrub off the mixture and any excess grime with a soft sponge, and enjoy your sparkling pan! [2] X Research source This method is safe to use on non-stick pans."

      "content": "Boil a 1:1 ratio of vinegar and water in a pan to remove stubborn burnt spots . Make sure you add enough liquid to completely cover any stains. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, and let it boil until you see any caked-on material start to come off. [3] X Research source Turn off the heat, dump out the mixture, and wash the pan with soap and water once it’s cool. Alternatively, use a long-handled scrub brush to scrub the pan right after you’ve turned the burner off, so the pot will still be hot. Just be very careful and wear an oven mitt to hold the scrub brush. [4] X Research source This method is safe to use on non-stick pans."

Then, take a sponge or scouring pad and scrub off any stains. [5] X Research source If you have a large enough sink, try this alternative for stubborn stains: plug the sink and fill it with hot water. Add ½ cup (about 100g) baking soda and ½ cup (118mL) vinegar. Let your pans soak for 30-60 minutes, then scrub off any remaining grime. [6] X Research source Soaking your pans will make it much easier to remove any burnt-on food or grime. This method is safe to use on non-stick pans."

Then, place your metal pan into the pot and let it “cook” for 15-30 minutes. Remove it with tongs or a hot pad—be very careful! Add a 1:1 ratio of baking soda and water to create a thick paste , and scrub the pan while it’s still hot.

Add a few drops of water to create a thick paste. Then, let the mixture sit for 20 minutes. Afterward, scrub the paste with steel wool to make your pans shiny again .

[10] X Research source Rinse and clean your pots and pans afterward with regular dish soap and water. This method isn’t ideal for non-stick pans because Borax is mildly abrasive."

      "content": "Let your pan soak with a dryer sheet to reduce scrubbing effort. It's certainly unconventional, but the fabric conditioning properties of dryer sheets can help cut through grime! Fill the pan with warm water, and add about 1 tsp (about 5mL) of dish soap. Place a dryer sheet into the soapy water, and let it sit for at least 1 hour. Pour the cleaning solution out, and finish the job by using a non-scratch sponge to remove any leftover material. [11] X Research source This method is safe for non-stick pans."

Rinse your pan off, and it should be tarnish-free. [12] X Research source Ketchup is also a great way to clean brass. This method is best for copper pans, and it likely won’t have much effect on non-stick pans (because they shouldn’t tarnish)."

Sprinkle salt into the pan, and cut a potato in half. Place the potato into the pan with the cut side down, and scrub vigorously, using circular motions. Rinse off any excess salt and starch, then season your cast iron pan with oil."

      "content": "Opt for a classic scrubbing approach with steel wool. Start by adding a splash of water to your pan. Then, take your steel wool and scrub away. Just keep in mind, you might have to scrub for roughly 30 minutes to make your pan look shiny and new again. [14] X Research source Steel wool is too aggressive for non-stick pans, and it could scratch regular pans. Use this method as a last resort and try a microfiber cloth instead."
