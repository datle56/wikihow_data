      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the various skill requirements for conducting euthanasia. Training will be needed before you go ahead and use any equipment on an animal that requires euthanizing. Not only will you need to know how to handle the equipment properly with both your and others' safety in mind (this is of utmost priority), you will also need to know how to take care of it before and after use, from cleaning and loading to safe storage, among other details. Knowing where and how to aim is also very important, especially if you are handling a firearm. Safety training before using a firearm is highly recommended , and should also be required before even owning and operating a firearm. Countries vary in their laws with respect to training, permit-carry, and other details. Some have more strict laws than others. Please check with your local state or provincial department of justice (and your federal one) to see what the laws are for gun ownership are for your area. Also ask if they know of any potential times and places (or who puts them on) for firearm safety training. You may also require some training with handling a penetrating cap-bolt gun. Though there is not the kind of training as with fire-arms, it's highly recommended to read the manual that comes with it before use and familiarize yourself with how it handles, how to take it apart to clean and lubricate it, safe handling, and other useful information. Remember to treat a cap-bolt gun just like a regular handgun. It can be just as dangerous if mishandled. It is a tool to stun large animals with, but if improperly handled it can turn into a deadly weapon. Another skill requirement is target practice. In order to be successful at euthanizing an animal that is 10 times bigger than you and just as strong, you must be proficient at where to aim to make that kill-shot, and, most importantly, how to aim. If you are not confident with your aiming skills, then do not attempt to euthanize an animal yourself. Get someone that is more competent to do the job."

      "title": "Analyze the considerations for selecting the best method of euthanasia.",
      "content": "Analyze the considerations for selecting the best method of euthanasia. The following elements to help you decide which method is most appropriate. Human Safety . This must be your first consideration. Using a firearm, for example, is the most risky method of euthanasia. Animal Welfare . All methods of euthanasia must be effective in producing rapid death with no detectable distress or pain to the animal. The method selected must take into account both human safety and animal welfare that is appropriate for a specific situation. Restraint . Appropriate methods of restraint should be used with euthanasia procedures. Methods like captive-bolt will require excellent restraint of the animal. Availability and quality of halters, cattle chutes, gates or other forms of restraint make certain forms of euthanasia more suitable than others. Practicality . Appropriate euthanasia techniques must be practical to the situation and for you to use. Though you may be responsible for carrying out euthanasia you may not have quick or easy access to any tools needed for euthanasia. While this won't make euthanasia alone impractical, it may be necessary to call on a neighbour or veterinarian to do the process for you. Cost . Cost varies with euthanasia options. Certain methods require a large investment initially which may pay for itself over time if it gets used often. This is certainly true with using cap-bolt guns or firearms. Aesthetics . The appearance of a method being more humane over others may be an influencing factor in euthanasia method of choice. A lethal injection of barbiturate makes the death process appear more \"peaceful\" because of the lack of involuntary movements that are more associated with using a firearm or penetrating cap-bolt. To an individual inexperienced with bovine euthanasia, these involuntary movements may be easily misinterpreted as painful voluntary responses, which may be further misinterpreted as that particular method of euthanasia as being \"inhumane\" or \"cruel.\" Thus when selecting a euthanasia method, the potential negative reactions by the animal and/or observer[s] should be considered. Diagnostics . If a sample needs to be collected for lab analysis, the selected method should not compromise that sample collection. This is especially true if a brain tissue sample needs to be sent in for BSE testing, for example. Carcass Disposal . One of the more critical considerations to make when selecting a euthanasia technique. Appropriate disposal of the carcass prevents scavenging and potential toxicity issues among wildlife. Carcasses must be handled and disposed of according to state/provincial and federal regulations. Options include rendering, composting, incineration and potentially landfills. Cattle euthanized with barbiturate overdose may not be accepted in rendering facilities because the drug tends to persist in the residual material following the rendering process. In some areas regulations require such animals to be incinerated or buried instead. Methods including gunshot or captive bolt may be more viable since they provide a more wider range of options for disposal."

These are, via the 2013 AVMA Guidelines for Euthanasia of Animals: Manually-applied blunt-force trauma to the head of calves or mature cattle, such as by a large hammer; This technique is especially not recommended for young calves because their skulls are too hard for this method to be effective, as well as the method lacks consistency based on restraint and complications with positioning the calf for effective use of this method. A purpose-built, non-penetrating cap-bolt stunner is an acceptable method of euthanasia for calves, provided a secondary euthanasia technique is carried out immediately after to ensure a quick death. Injection of off-label chemical agents or substances not permitted for use as euthanasia agents (i.e., disinfectants, non-anaesthetic pharmaceutical agents); Sedation with an alpha-2 agonist such as xylazine, followed by potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, or any other euthanasia method requiring the animal to be unconscious before its use; Injecting air into a vein; Electrocution with a 120 or 220 volt electrical cord; Drowning; Exsanguination of conscious animals."

You want to keep in mind that the animals be kept as stress-free and as calm as possible. Animals stressed prior to euthanasia are more prone to be dangerous and unpredictable. Keep the animal's and your safety in mind when choosing when and how to move an animal prior to euthanasia. Do not forcibly move or drag downer cattle prior to euthanasia. This will certainly cause unnecessary stress in the animal. Restraint--and in choosing what type--should also be done as safely and least stressful as possible.

Lack of corneal reflex (no response when the eyeball is touched); Normally conscious animals will blink when the eyeball is touched. Presence of rigor mortis. The above criteria will need to be observed for a period of at least 5 minutes after euthanasia.

This step is very important and must be performed within a few seconds-- not minutes--to ensure death of the animal while it is still unconscious. The following secondary euthanasia methods and how to perform them are: Exsanguination [11] X Research source : Using a very sharp knife, like a 6-inch hunting knife or boning knife, insert the blade fully behind the point of the jaw and draw downwards until blood is freely flowing. The carotid artery and jugular vein must be severed for this to work effectively. Another method of exsanguination or blood-letting is severing the brachial vasculature. Lift one of the forelimbs (one most easily accessible, as the animal will [or should] be laying on its side), and insert the knife deeply at the point of the elbow and cut the skin and vasculature until the limb can be laid back against the chest of the animal. Chest-sticking is done to severe the vessels that extend from the top of the heart, like the vena cava and aorta. It is probably the most effective method of exsanguination because all blood flow to the head is stopped once these vessels are cut. A long blade (~6 to 8 inches, as mentioned) needs to be used; Insert fully into the chest in the mid-line where the brisket joins the ventral neck. Use a sideways slicing action in one direction and then the other to ensures that the vessels are severed. [12] X Research source A third method is transecting the terminal aorta via the rectum so that blood pools in the abdominal cavity. This should only be done by a trained individual, like a veterinarian. Pithing : Insert a pithing rod or similar tool into and through the entry site, and manipulate the rod deep into the head of the animal to destroy both brain stem and spinal cord tissue attached to the brain to ensure death of the animal. Lethal IV Injection : A rapid injection of a saturated solution of either potassium chloride (KCl) or magnesium sulfate into the blood vessel will induce cardiac arrest. For most mature cows, an injection of 250 mL of KCl is appropriate, but the exact dosage for any animal may vary due to size of the animal. Solution must be given until death is confirmed. Magnesium sulfate is delivered similar to KCl, but is approved for use only in anaesthetized animals, and results in much slower death. Cattle must be unconscious or anaesthetized before this particular method can be used. It's also recommended to have a veterinarian perform this secondary euthanasia procedure."

    {
      "title": "Select the right gun with the right bullets for the job.",
      "content": "Select the right gun with the right bullets for the job. Current AVMA recommendations suggest that a .22 caliber handgun or right loaded with a solid-point bullet is sufficient for calves, but is not be recommended for use for more mature, larger stock. You are best to go with a handgun or rifle that have muzzle energies above 300 ft/lb. It's important to use solid-point bullets as well with these higher-caliber guns. Bulls will need heavier-powered firearms to be euthanized. The best are those that are capable of 1000 ft per lb of muzzle velocity to be able to penetrate the very thick skull of a bull. Some countries, like in Canada, dictate that the .22 rifle is not humane for euthanizing any cattle, but rather firearms with muzzle energy of at least 300 ft/lb are ideal for calves under 400 pounds, and firearms with energies at 1000 ft/lb or more are recommended for mature livestock from cows to bulls. Shotguns are an excellent alternative to handguns or rifles, but they carry a little greater margin of risk, especially if used at greater distances than the recommended 1 to 2 yards (1 to 2 meters) from the intended target. Use of the 12, 16, and 20-gauge shotguns are ideal for mature cows, bulls, elk, and horses loaded with slugs or No. 2-, 4-, or 6-size birdshot.

The latter two are less difficult with placement of the bullet. However, when the animal is on its feet, on the move and posing to be a dangerous threat, the recommended standard of shooting at the forehead may be much more of a challenge. A downed or compromised animal is easier to shoot at the head. This is because the angle of the shot is very important for the bullet to not only penetrate the brain, but also into the brainstem. It is very difficult to aim perpendicular to the head when the animal is standing up or moving away, unless you are very very tall or the animals are very short and small. You can also shoot them at a closer distance, at the recommended 1 to 3 feet from the intended target. Animals on their feet generally won't allow you to get at arm's-length from them, and you wouldn't want to especially with dangerous stock. These animals will need to be shot from a distance, aiming for the lower chest just above the elbow (or behind if the animal is moving away at an angle you can still see the target zone), the head, or neck.
