Use a ruler to measure the height, width, and length of the shoebox on its four sides and its lid. Write these measurements down. Use a ruler to measure the length and width of the top of the lid. Measure the height of the lip of the top and add that onto both the length and width measurements. Write the measurements down."

Gift boxes are a slightly nicer option for money box material and so can be ideal for making a wedding box--the box into which guests can put checks, money, cards, etc. at a wedding reception. This particular design mimics the look of a tiered wedding cake or a stack of gifts. Choose three gift boxes (or whatever number you prefer). The boxes you choose can be square or round, depending on your own preference or the wedding theme. The boxes should be in descending size, in order to create what will appear to be a stack."

The box you choose is up to you; the top box will be easier for people to see, while the middle box will be larger. The placement of the slot depends on how you're decorating the box and what you think will be more visually pleasing. Use a ruler and marker to trace out a rectangular shape either on the lid or side of the top box or on the side of the middle box. The rectangle should be slim but both long and wide enough to accommodate long envelopes. Cut out a neat rectangle shape. Use a craft knife to cut out the rectangle shape to form an envelope slot. A craft knife is preferable over scissors, which will leave ragged edges."
