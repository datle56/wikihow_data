      "content": "Look for a recycling symbol. Different varieties of plastic require different glues. The easiest way to identify the type is to search for a recycling symbol on the plastic itself, the label, or the packaging the object came in. This symbol is a triangle formed by three arrows, and contains a number, letter or both inside or below the triangle."

This is best glued with a poly cement (also called plastic cement), or a specialized plastic glue such as Loctite Epoxy Plastic Binder or Super Glue Plastic Fusion.

      "content": "Select a specialized glue for plastic marked 2, 4, or 5. If your material is labeled 2 , 4 , 5 , HDPE , LDPE , PP , or UMHW , you have a type of \"polyethylene\" or \"polypropylene\". These plastics are much more difficult to glue, and you'll need to look for a specific product that names these types on its label, such as Loctite Plastics Bonding System or Scotch Weld DP 8010."

      "content": "Make the right choice for plastics marked 7 or 9. The miscellany category marked 7 or the ABS type marked 9 can indicate a variety of plastic resins, with many possible letters indicating subtypes. Your best bet for gluing it is an epoxy or cyanoacrylate."

      "content": "Try to identify the plastic type in other ways. If there is no recyclable system, you may have to guess at which type of plastic it is before you can select a glue. Here's a guide to help you accomplish this task: Lego bricks are made from a type of plastic called \"ABS\", and are best glued using epoxy cement. ABS solvent cement will also work, but may alter the shape of the material's surface. Imitation glass, cheap toys, CD cases, and similar brittle, often clear plastic is usually \"polystyrene\" and can be glued using a number of adhesives. For best results, use a poly cement or a glue advertised for plastic bonding. Glue tough, hard plastic found in bottles, buckets, crates, and food containers using a product that specifically advertises the ability to bond \"polyethylene\" and \"polypropylene\". These are impossible to glue by most normal methods, so don't assume a product labeled \"for plastic\" will work unless it specifically mentions \"polyethylene\" or \"polypropylene\"."

      "content": "Do further research if gluing plastic to another substance. If you are gluing plastic to wood, metal, glass, or even a different type of plastic, you'll need to commit to further research. If you can't find an answer online or by asking an experienced handyman, go to the hardware store and look at each brand of adhesive you've determined you could use following the above steps. The packaging should tell you what substances it can glue onto plastic. Visit This to That for extensive advice on which glue to use for each combination of materials. This advice will be most helpful for common types of plastic, especially polystyrene. If you are unsure which to use, try testing an adhesive with scrap material of the same types, or in an unobtrusive corner of your object in need of gluing."

      "content": "Mix the two glue components together if required. Two-part \"epoxies\" require two ingredients to be mixed together to activate the adhesive. Read the instructions on the container carefully, as there are many types of epoxy and each requires a certain ratio of the two ingredients. Some of them can be used for several hours after mixing, while others require application within a few minutes. See Selecting a Glue to learn which type of glue to use. You can skip this step if you are not using a two-part adhesive."

For tiny pieces, such as a broken piece on a plastic model, you can use the tip of a needle instead. If you are using a solvent cement ( not a poly cement or plastic cement), you should clamp the pieces together first, then use an applicator bottle to put a thin line of solvent cement along the edge between the pieces, where it will be drawn between them. If you are using it on plastic pipes, see Gluing Plastic Pipes instead."

      "content": "Press the pieces lightly together. Press them together to get them in place and remove air bubbles. Don't push so hard that the adhesive oozes out of the joint. If it does, wipe away the excess unless you are using an acrylic cement, which should be left to evaporate."

      "content": "Keep the pieces firmly in place. Use a clamp, vise, masking tape, or rubber bands to hold them firmly together. Read the instructions on your adhesive container to know how long to leave them in place. Depending on the type and brand of adhesive, the bond could take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to develop. Many plastic adhesives continue to \"cure\", or develop a stronger bond, for days or even weeks after application. Avoid applying stress and heat to the glued piece for at least 24 hours after application, even if the bond seems strong."

      "title": "Identify your pipe.",
      "content": "Identify your pipe. There are three types of plastic pipe, and each will only work with certain glues. The easiest way to identify them is to look for the worldwide recycling symbol, a triangle formed from three arrows with a number or letters to identify the type of plastic. Learn how to use this and other identification methods before selecting a glue. [4] X Research source PVC pipe is common in residential plumbing, although it should not be used for distribution lines or other high-temperature applications. It is usually white, or grey if used for electrical or industrial purposes. Its recycling symbol is 6 or PVC . CPVC pipe is PVC pipe treated to withstand higher temperatures. It has an identical recycling symbol (6 or PVC) but is usually tan or cream colored. ABS is an older and more flexible type of plastic piping, usually black in color. It is not suitable for drinking water purposes and in some regions may not be legal for any plumbing uses. Its recycling symbol is 9 , ABS , or 7 (other) . PEX pipe is the newest type of plastic piping, available in many colors. It is not recyclable. It cannot be glued, and must be attached using mechanical fitting tools."

      "title": "Select an adhesive.",
      "content": "Select an adhesive. The material that bonds plastic piping together is called solvent cement . Find the specific solvent cement you need after you've identified the type of plastic. [5] X Research source ABS solvent cement will join two ABS pipes together. PVC solvent cement and CPVC solvent cement similarly join two pipes of that type. Transition solvent cement is used to join an ABS pipe to a PVC pipe. Its distinctive green color makes it easy to identify. If you can't find a more specialized product, universal solvent cement will do an okay job for any combination of PVC, CPVC, and ABS. You should still identify your pipe beforehand to rule out PEX pipe, which must be fitted instead of glued. Read the label of the solvent cement to make sure it will work on the size of pipe you're using. To attach a plastic pipe to a metal one, you may need a specific adhesive for that specific plastic and specific metal combination, or a mechanical fitting method. Contact a plumber or hardware store employee for advice."

The goal is to remove uneven pieces and \"burrs\" created from sawing, which can otherwise catch debris and cause clogs.
