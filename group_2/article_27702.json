Shake the beans well afterward to remove the excess moisture. [1] X Research source As you rinse the soybeans, remove any shrunken or discolored beans."

      "content": "Soak the beans overnight. After you’ve rinsed the soybeans, place them in a large pot. Cover the beans with 12 cups (2.8 l) of cold water to create a ratio of 3 parts water to 1 part beans so the beans have room to expand. Allow the beans to soak for 9 to 12 hours. [2] X Research source During colder months, you may need to soak the beans longer, so it may take as many as 15 to 20 hours."

      "content": "Place the beans in a sterilized pot. From this point in the natto-making process, it’s crucial that all of the containers and utensils you use are sterilized or mold and bacteria may develop. Boil a pot in water on high heat for 10 minutes to sterilize it. Dry it with a clean towel, and then add the beans to it.

Use the special spoon that comes with the powder to add one spoonful of the spores to a small sterilized bowl. Add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of boiled water to the powder, and stir the mixture with a sterilized spoon until the powder dissolves. [8] X Research source Nattomoto powder is also known as natto spores or natto starter. You can purchase it from Japanese grocery stores and online retailers."
