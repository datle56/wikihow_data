So reducing the number 11 would be adding 1 and 1 to get 2. First, start by reducing the month, day, and year to a single digit each. Next, add those three numbers together. Lastly, reduce the final sum until you get a single number. [24] X Research source For example, the process of finding the Life Path Number of someone born on February 18, 1994 would look like this: Month : 2 Day : 18 = 1 + 8 = 9 Year (first reduction) : 1994 = 1 + 9 + 9 + 4 = 23 Year (second reduction) : 23 = 2 + 3 = 5 Life Path Number (first reduction) : 2 + 9 + 5 = 16 Life Path Number (final reduction) : 16 = 1 + 6 = 7 The Life Path Number for someone born on February 18, 1994 would be 7."
