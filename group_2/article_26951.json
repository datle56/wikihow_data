      "content": "Heat your water. Use a tea kettle or pot to heat water for your tea. Heat the water until it boils. [2] X Research source You should not let the water boil for long. Remove the water from the heat as soon as you see small bubbles forming."

      "content": "Try adding honey. If you want to add a bit of sweetness to your tea, try adding a small spoonful of honey. Honey has antifungal, antibacterial, and antimicrobial properties. It can potentially boost your health as well as sweetening your tea. [5] X Research source Honey is very sweet, so a little goes a long way. Add only a small teaspoon of honey to a cup of tea."

      "content": "Add milk for a hint of sweetness. If you dislike sweetening your tea too much, consider adding milk. Milk can add a mild, creamy flavor that is somewhat sweet. However, it will not make your tea too sugary. Just make sure not to use milk if you're lactose intolerant. [6] X Research source Some people find milk helps them fall asleep. While the truth of this claim is unclear, if milk has helped you sleep in the past, it may help you fall asleep when mixed with chamomile tea."

You can also add something like fruit juice to add a little sweetness to your tea. [8] X Research source If you're trying to cut back on sugar, make sure to avoid juices with added sugar."
