      "title": "Apply pressure to the wound.",
      "content": "Apply pressure to the wound. Push your tongue up to the roof of your mouth and hold it there for 5 seconds at a time. Your tongue will most likely start bleeding the moment it is bitten because it is highly vascular. Applying pressure to the area will slow the blood flow and allow it to clot.

If you have one of these injuries, contact your doctor or dentist. [4] X Research source"

Do this several times over the next few days.

Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful antiseptic which will help to control bacterial activity in your wound. It will also act as a cleansing agent by removing debris from the cut and delivering a constant quantity of oxygen to the cells, which also helps to stop the bleeding. However, hydrogen peroxide has been shown to cause irritation, especially when used long-term. [13] X Research source Always use a weak concentration, and only swish it in your mouth for a few seconds at a time. Hydrogen peroxide can also help whiten your teeth.
