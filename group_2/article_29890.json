Although milk and juice are common smoothie liquids, you could use water, coconut milk, yogurt, or non-dairy milk, such as soy, hemp, or almond milk. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Put 2 to 3 cups (350 to 525 g) of fruit into the blender. Most smoothies include fruit and you can choose a single type or a combination. You can also decide if you'd like to use fresh or frozen fruit. Frozen fruit will make your smoothie slightly thicker, so you may want to leave the ice out when you blend it. Keep in mind that some fruits, such as bananas or mangoes, are so sweet that you might not need to use additional sweeteners. Try making a smoothie with any of these fruits: Berries: strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries Citrus: oranges, grapefruits Pears Stone fruit: peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries Mangos Bananas Papayas"

      "title": "Scoop in additional dairy if you'd like to thicken the smoothie.",
      "content": "Scoop in additional dairy if you'd like to thicken the smoothie. Instead of pouring in more milk, which will make the smoothie thinner, add a scoop of Greek yogurt or frozen yogurt. The Greek yogurt will add protein and firm up the smoothie while the frozen yogurt will make the entire smoothie taste creamier and thick. Experiment by using different flavors of yogurt. You could match the flavors of the fruits or use complementary flavors. For example, make a peach smoothie with peach Greek yogurt or try a peanut butter smoothie with chocolate frozen yogurt."

      "content": "Include spices, herbs, or flavorings to make a unique smoothie. You'll get a lot of delicious flavor from the produce you use, so you don't have to add spices unless you want a very specific flavor. For example, if you want warming flavors, add a few pinches of cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, or cardamom. For a strong herbal flavor, put 1 to 2 sprigs of fresh herbs, such as basil or lavender. For a detox smoothie, add 2 to 3 cups of greens, such as spinach or kale."

      "content": "Add nut butter, oats, or nuts to give the smoothie a filling texture. If you'd like more protein in your smoothie, add 1 to 2 spoonfuls of your favorite nut butter, rolled oats, or tofu. You might want to include interesting textures by mixing in a handful of nuts or seeds, such as chia seeds, flaxseeds, or sunflower seeds. Once you've blended the smoothie, you may want to include even more unique textures. You could stir in a handful of dried fruit, a few spoonfuls of toasted coconut, a small scoop of mini-chocolate chips, or a handful of crushed graham crackers. Superfoods such as ginger, chia seeds, protein powder, or hemp seeds are usually great ingredients for a healthy smoothie."

      "content": "Include a scoop of protein powder or your favorite supplement. If you'd like to add protein, but don't want your smoothie to taste like peanut butter, add about 2 tablespoons (28 g) of protein powder. The powder will quickly dissolve in the smoothie. This is also a great chance to use any powdered nutritional supplement you're taking. Try blending your collagen supplement into your morning breakfast smoothie, for instance."

      "content": "Add about 1 cup (220 g) of ice. If you'd like a thick smoothie, start with at least 1 cup (220 g) of ice and add more as needed. If you're using frozen fruit, you could leave the ice out since the frozen fruit will act like ice. Keep in mind that if you leave the ice out with fresh fruit, your smoothie will be more like juice. [3] X Research source You can freeze any of the smoothie ingredients to help the drink firm up. For example, instead of using fresh berries, open a bag of frozen berries and pour them directly into the blender."

Then, pour the smoothie into 1 or 2 serving glasses and enjoy! If you need to store extra smoothie, pour it into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 8 months. Keep in mind that the smoothie will begin to melt in the fridge and you may want to blend it with more ice before you serve it. To serve the frozen smoothie, transfer it directly to the blender and mix it until it's smooth."
