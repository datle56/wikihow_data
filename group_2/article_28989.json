Press the Hershey's Kisses (pointy side in) onto the end of his snout, and cut the marshmallow in half and place the chocolate chips on top."

      "content": "Prep the base. In order to ad smoking nostrils to your dragon, you'll first need a base that raises the cake board an inch or two. Cut out the bottom of a cardboard box, or use the bottom of a deep pizza box. Whatever you use, make sure it will accommodate your dry ice chamber, which could be a small, washed-out aspirin container, a small dish with plastic wrap over it, or whatever else you have on-hand. Cover the base in aluminum foil or other thick paper."

Using a serrated knife, cut a circle about the size of a nickel under where you plan to have the dragon's nostrils. Then, put the cake board over the base and, using your first hole as a guide, cut a circle in the base."

      "content": "Cut out nostril holes in the cake. After you've cut up the cake and have a head piece, use a straw to poke holes for the nostril. If you've allowed your cake to cool sufficiently, punching it with the straw should remove small amounts of cake without damaging the surrounding area. Be careful that you don't punch too close to the edges, and make holes two to three straws wide."

      "title": "Trim your straws.",
      "content": "Trim your straws. You'll be using straws to carry vapor from the dry ice chamber up to the dragon nostrils, but you probably won't need them to be full length. Depending on how deep your base is, trim your straws so that they're an appropriate length."

      "title": "Feed the straws through the nostrils before frosting.",
      "content": "Feed the straws through the nostrils before frosting. Your straws should go through the cake separately, then meet up at the hole in the cake board and the base before going into the dry ice chamber. You don't need the chamber beneath the straws for now."

      "title": "Right before the party, prepare the dry ice chamber.",
      "content": "Right before the party, prepare the dry ice chamber. Put a few walnut-sized pieces of dry ice in your container, as well as some warm water. Seal the opening as much as you can. For instance, if you're using a washed-out pill bottle, stuff the opening with a few ratted-out cotton balls after you put the straws in. If you're using a small dish cover it in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and slice out two small holes for the straws. Remember, you want the majority of the vapor escaping through the straws."

    {
      "title": "Put the dry ice chamber under the cake.",
      "content": "Put the dry ice chamber under the cake. Lift the cake, cake board and base up to slide the dry ice chamber underneath and direct the straws in (get a second person to help you do this). You might find as your lifting that you need to trim the straws a bit to fit them in the chamber, so keep a pair of scissors on hand. Once you've settled the cake over the chamber, your fire-breathing dragon should have smoking nostrils."
