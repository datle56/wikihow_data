You can format your brochure in a variety of ways depending on the needs of your project: [1] X Research source Tri-Fold Brochure: This is the more typical pamphlet-style brochure that folds into three distinct sections. You often see this style in museums and school projects . One-Page Brochure: This is a minimalistic brochure without folds that has all of the information on one page. Two-Page Brochure: This variety just has one fold, splitting the paper into 2 sections, like a greeting card."

Before you get started, decide what you want your tri-fold brochure to look like. Brochures come in many shapes and sizes. Think about how many pages you want your brochure to have and the size of each page. You can share the Google Doc file with your coworkers or project members if you want to collaborate on the design at the same time."

To do this: [4] X Research source Click the Insert menu at the top of Docs. Select the Table menu. Drag your mouse so only the top three squares are highlighted. Each of the squares will represent a column in your brochure. When you see the new table, press the Enter or Return key repeatedly to extend the columns to the bottom of the second page. Since you're making a tri-fold brochure, you'll want your columns to line up on both sides of the sheet. The idea is that you'll see three vertical columns on both sides of the page (you can hide the actual lines later). Although you haven't added data yet, this gives you some visual table lines to work with."

Since you'll be folding the brochure along the lines, the layout will look like this: [5] X Research source Page 1 (the \"outside\" page): Inside flap (this part folds in) | Back Cover | Front Cover Page 2 (the \"inside\" page): Other side of inside flap | Inside of Back Cover | Inside of Front Cover It might be more helpful to visualize if you take a sheet of paper, draw column markers, and then fold it in this order: Fold the left panel down (behind the cover). Fold the right panel (the cover) behind so it covers the other panels (the back cover will now be at the top). Flip the folded brochure over so the cover page is on top (and opens like a book)."

      "content": "Design the front cover. The front cover of the tri-fold brochure will be the rightmost column on the first page (column 3). The design of your cover is up to you, but here are a few ideas to get you started: Type your desired title at the top (or anywhere, really) of column 3. Just click the mouse cursor in the column and start typing. To stylize the text, highlight what you've typed and use the text style menus and buttons that run along the top of the document. For example, you can select a style by clicking the menu that says Normal text and choosing an option. You can also change the font face, size, weight, and even color. It's common to center the title. To do so, highlight it and click the button of 4 centered lines in the toolbar. A strong cover image is important to illustrate the purpose of the brochure, as well as draw the interest of readers. To add an image, click the desired location, click the Insert menu, select Image , navigate to the image's location, select it, and then click Open . Drag the blue anchors around the image's edges to resize if needed."

Brochure back panels often include contact information, credits, and closing statements. Occasionally back panels are even designed as mailing panels so you can mail it without an envelope. It's a good idea to make the back panel as vibrant as the front so it draws attention to matter where the brochure is placed."

The third column on the second page is the inside of the front cover. Since this is usually where you'll introduce the product or service, it'll probably be a little more text-heavy than the sections. When you open a tri-fold brochure, you'll see a flap on the right side that can be opened up. That flap, which is the leftmost column of Page 1, should contain stand-alone information, such as an ad, or special offer."

      "content": "Add content to the rest of your brochure. Since you've introduced the product or service in the first column of page 2, you can continue adding content to the remaining pages. Since you already know how to add text and photos, check out these tips for more in-depth image formatting: If you add images, you'll want to make them work with the text by setting up wrapping. Click the image after inserting it, and then click one of the three wrap icons below it. Inline (icon 1) means the image will be added as part of the text, causing the image to shift when text is added or deleted. This is not recommended as it can cause formatting issues in the case of a brochure. Wrap text (icon 2) allows text to flow around and to the side of an image. This is a good option for the inside of a brochure when you have small images amongst paragraph text. Break text (icon 3) means the text will stop above and continue below the image. This is a good option for tri-fold brochures as the columns are small and don't have a lot of space for text to go around the image."

Here's how to this in Google Docs: Click the File menu and select Print . Select your printer from the \"Destination\" menu. Select how many copies to print (start with one just to make sure you like what you see). Expand the More settings menu. In the \"Two-sided\" section, check the box next to \"Print on both sides,\" and then select Flip on short edge from the drop-down menu.

Modern Writer is also a portrait-oriented brochure intended to be folded in half, like a greeting card. It has 4 pages, which is great if you intend to make a booklet.
