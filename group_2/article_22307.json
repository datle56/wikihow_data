      "title": "Identify the spot on your tongue that’s hurting the most.",
      "content": "Identify the spot on your tongue that’s hurting the most. Wash your hands and use a clean finger to gently probe your tongue. Try and identify where the acid from the candy affected your tongue most, so you can accurately apply the topical medicine. [2] X Research source For instance, if you kept the candy in the center of your tongue until it dissolved, that part of your tongue might be the most sore."

      "title": "Use a swab to dry the sorest part of your tongue.",
      "content": "Use a swab to dry the sorest part of your tongue. Take a cotton swab and use it to soak up any saliva on the painful areas of your tongue. If you want, feel free to dry off the entire surface—just be sure to focus on the spot where you plan to apply the gel. As you do this, try not to reach too far back in the mouth with the swab, as this might trigger an unwanted gag reflex. [3] X Research source Some oral gel packages come with swabs or special applicators."

      "title": "Apply the product to your tongue with another Q-tip.",
      "content": "Apply the product to your tongue with another Q-tip. Dip a new cotton swab into the bottle of benzocaine oral gel.

[4] X Research source You can find this product at most pharmacies."

      "title": "Let the medicine dissolve over a period of 6 hours.",
      "content": "Let the medicine dissolve over a period of 6 hours. Don’t swallow the medicine—instead, let it soak in your tongue and provide relief. If your tongue is still sore after 6 hours, feel free to apply a thin layer of the gel again. Overall, this medicine can be applied up to 4 times each day. [5] X Research source If the medicine is swallowed directly, phone a Poison Control Center or medical professional for advice."

      "content": "Melt a small chip of ice on your tongue. Take a small piece of ice and set it on the most painful area of your tongue.

While this isn’t a long-lasting solution, you can find some instant relief from tongue discomfort when you use ice. [7] X Research source Don’t use a huge ice cube for this. Instead, try using a piece of ice that’s close to the size of your injury."
