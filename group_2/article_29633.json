      "content": "Find a metal pen with a removable cartridge and metal tip. You can't use a pen with a plastic tip to make a pipe because plastic melts and releases toxic smoke when it burns. Only use a pen with a metal tip that can be unscrewed to reduce the odds that you unnecessarily expose yourself to dangerous chemicals when you smoke. [1] X Research source You can use a pen with a metal tip and a plastic case, but it's better if the case is made out of metal as well. The tip of the pen is the small metal cone that surrounds the point when you're writing."

      "title": "Unscrew the metal tip and set it aside for later.",
      "content": "Unscrew the metal tip and set it aside for later. Grip the metal tip with your dominant thumb and index finger. Brace the pen with your nondominant hand to keep it from moving. Twist the tip of the pen counterclockwise until it slides right off of the pen case. Set it aside for later. [2] X Research source The metal tip will serve as your bowl. If you cannot remove the metal tip on the pen, you cannot use the pen as a pipe. If the ink cartridge slides out when you do this, discard the cartridge. Run the metal tip under water and wipe it with a paper towel if it has any ink residue or grime on it."

      "title": "Pry out the bottom cap and remove the ink cartridge.",
      "content": "Pry out the bottom cap and remove the ink cartridge. Flip the pen over and put a little pressure on the edge of the cap with the tip of your thumb. If it gives a little, apply a little more pressure to pop it out. Some bottom caps can be unscrewed by twisting them. If you can't remove the bottom cap by hand, try using a dull knife and hold the end of the pen away from you as you press the blade of the knife into the lip of the cap. [3] X Research source If the bottom cap is sealed or glued into the case of the pen, you cannot use it to create a pipe. Throw out the ink cartridge and bottom cap. You don't need them. The only pieces you'll need to make a pipe are the metal tip and the case of the pen. Throw away any springs, cushions, or caps."

      "title": "Flip the metal tip around and insert it into the opening of the pen.",
      "content": "Flip the metal tip around and insert it into the opening of the pen. Hold the case of the pen in your nondominant hand and hold the tip in your other hand. Flip the tip around so that the point where the pen tip used to be is pointing into the body of the case. Slide the point of the tip into the opening of your pen case. [4] X Research source Tilt the pen case upwards while you're doing this so that the tip doesn't fall out."

    {
      "title": "Apply some pressure to the upside-down tip to stick it in place.",
      "content": "Apply some pressure to the upside-down tip to stick it in place. Hold the case still with your nondominant hand and use your other index finger or thumb to press down on the outer rim of the metal tip. Apply firm pressure, but don't press so hard that you break it. Tilt the pen down a little to see if it stays in place. [5] X Research source If the metal tip won't stay in the case, try pressing it into the opening at an angle. If you can't get the tip to stay in the opening, chew a piece of gum until it's soft. Spit it out into your hand and wrap it around the outside of the tip before pushing it into the pen. The gum will dry and function as a safe adhesive."

      "title": "Add a cigarette filter to the opening at the other end if you want a softer throat hit.",
      "content": "Add a cigarette filter to the opening at the other end if you want a softer throat hit. You will put the tobacco into the metal tip and put your lips on the opposite end of the pen case. If you want to filter the tobacco, you can put a clean cigarette filter into the opening of the open end. Simply slide the cotton into place or squeeze it into the opening to create a filter. [6] X Research source This won't make smoking safe. It will simply make the flavor a little a lighter and the smoke a little softer."

    {
      "title": "Pack your tobacco into the tip by hand.",
      "content": "Pack your tobacco into the tip by hand. Hold the pipe in your nondominant hand with the tip pointing upwards. Pinch a chunk of loose tobacco in between your dominant thumb and index finger. Place the tobacco into the conical opening of the metal tip. Press the tobacco down with your finger to pack it tightly. [7] X Research source Don't add so much tobacco that it will become impossible to inhale."

    {
      "title": "Light your tobacco for 1-2 seconds while inhaling to smoke.",
      "content": "Light your tobacco for 1-2 seconds while inhaling to smoke. Lift the open end of the pen case up to your lips. Hold a lighter up to the metal tip and ignite it by flicking it. Inhale as the tobacco starts to burn to pull the smoke through the case. Release the lighter and put the pen down to enjoy the smoke before exhaling it out. You may have an easier time tilting the pen upwards while inhaling to keep the tobacco and the metal tip in the opening."

    {
      "title": "Discard your pen after 1-2 smoking sessions.",
      "content": "Discard your pen after 1-2 smoking sessions. Pens are not designed to be used as pipes. Using them more than once or twice as a pipe can cause the case to melt or release dangerous chemicals. Discard your pen after 1-2 uses and make another one if you really need to smoke. This should really be a last-ditch method for smoking. Before you need another pipe, go out and get a glass bowl, rolling papers, or even a piece of fruit and use that instead."
