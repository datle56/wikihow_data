      "content": "Wash your hands! Before you begin cleaning and touching your wound, it is important that your hands are clean to prevent infection. Have a clean, dry paper towel easily accessible to prevent contamination of sterile hands. Wash your hands with soap and lukewarm water for 30 seconds. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Dirty hands may increase the likelihood of infecting your wound. To wash your hands thoroughly, scrub between your fingers, underneath your fingernails, and up past your wrists. If visible debris remains, rewash hands."

      "content": "Check the wound. Look for excessive bleeding or signs of infection. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use a sterile gauze to apply gentle pressure on the wound if bleeding. With clean hands, place clean gauze to cover the entire wound. Make sure to maintain pressure to the wound, if still bleeding, to decrease blood flow and encourage blood clotting. Only use a moderate amount of pressure, because too much pressure may cause further damage. If wound continues to bleed for more than a few minutes, seek professional help. Skip this step if your wound is not bleeding."

      "title": "Rinse wound with cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse wound with cool water. For a wound that is not bleeding, slowly pour cool, distilled (if possible) water over the wound area. This will wash away any debris or foreign contaminants that could may be present in the afflicted area. Rinse the area around the wound as well. Do not scrub the wound hard as this may damage more tissue or increase bleeding. Rinsing the wound with warm water will increase blood circulation and bleeding."

      "title": "Boil eight ounces of water.",
      "content": "Boil eight ounces of water. To prepare a saline solution, first pour eight ounces of distilled water into a saucepan and bring to a boil. The water does not have to be rapidly boiling. Once bubbles reach the surface of the water, it is considered boiling. Continue to boil for 15 minutes. [3] X Research source Boiling the water will ensure it is sterile."

      "title": "Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.",
      "content": "Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Slowly pour 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the boiling water and stir to dissolve. Make sure not to use iodized salt. When salt (sodium chloride) is iodized, it changes its structure and function. Continue stirring the solution until salt is completely dissolved. Once the salt is completely dissolved, turn the stove off. [4] X Research source The saline solution should appear to be clear. It should not be cloudy or milky in appearance. The salt has completely dissolved when you no longer see any salt granules."

      "title": "Allow the saline solution to cool to room temperature.",
      "content": "Allow the saline solution to cool to room temperature. After about 15-20 minutes, test the temperature of the water with a thermometer. The water has cooled sufficiently when it reaches a temperature of approximately 70 °F (21.1 °C), or is comfortable to the touch."

      "title": "Pour the solution into a bottle.",
      "content": "Pour the solution into a bottle. Use a sterile, narrow-top bottle, and funnel to pour the solution directly into the bottle. Tightly fasten the cap onto the bottle. [5] X Research source Both the bottle and funnel need to be sterile before pouring the saline solution."

      "title": "Gently pat a moistened cotton ball onto the wound.",
      "content": "Gently pat a moistened cotton ball onto the wound. Several cotton balls may be needed depending on the size of the wound. Cleanse around the wound as well. It is important to be gentle as there is a potential to damage surrounding tissue if too much pressure is applied."

      "content": "Cut several pieces of medical tape into three inch strips. It is important to cover open wounds to prevent an infection and to avoid bacteria, debris and dirt from entering the wound. The tape will be applied to hold the gauze onto the wound. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Medical tape is highly recommended as it is easily removable, without damaging the skin. Be sure not to place the medical tape directly onto the wound. Its purpose is to secure the dressing in place."

      "title": "Replace the gauze.",
      "content": "Replace the gauze. Old wound coverings can promote infections and slow down the healing process. If you have bled through the gauze, it is important to change it. At first, the dressing may need replacing every three to four hours, then up to once or twice a day as it begins to heal.
