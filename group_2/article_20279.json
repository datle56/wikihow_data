If you are a British citizen, have been living in Britain, and are at least 18 years old (or 16, for some councils), you are eligible to get on the waiting list for council housing. [2] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source If you are a citizen, but you have been living abroad recently, the council will review your information and decide whether your are eligible. If you are not a citizen, you must be a worker from the European Economic Area, a family member of that worker, a refugee, or been granted leave to remain in the UK. [3] X Research source It is possible to challenge a council's decision to decline your application, but you may need to find a housing advisor to assist you. If you are not certain what status you have as an immigrant, contact an immigration adviser."

While it is required to give priority to people in certain circumstances, as described below, other details of the applications can vary. You may apply through more than once council, but many councils give priority to people who live in the area served by the council.

      "content": "Apply to housing associations as well. Housing associations are similar to council housing, but are private, non-profit organizations instead of public institutions. You may apply to any number of housing associations. If you do not know any in your area, your local council should be able to direct you to them, or even send them an application for you.

The application form often comes with a leaflet explaining how that specific council determines priority on the waiting list. While the details vary from council to council, every council in the UK is required to give higher priority to people in the following circumstances. If any of this applies to you, make sure to mention it somewhere on your application form: [7] X Research source [8] X Research source You are living in an unsanitary or overcrowded home, a home in severe disrepair, or one without washing or cooking facilities. (If these apply to you, see the section on homelessness to find out whether you meet the government definition.) You need to move out of your current home for medical, welfare, or safety reasons. This may include mobility issues, mental health issues, or threats of domestic violence or hate crimes in your area. You need to move to a specific area within the council's authority, or you would suffer hardship. For example, you need to move to take care of a relative nearby, or you need access to a specialized school for your child."

      "content": "Learn about specific factors that influence some councils. There are many factors that individual councils may use to determine who has priority on the waiting list. You may have a higher priority spot on the list if you have served in the UK Armed Forces (and especially if you have been injured as an Armed Forces member), if you have resided in the area for a long time, if you have a good tenancy record, or if you have been waiting for housing for a long time. [9] X Research source Since this reduced-rent housing is intended for low income people, your income and benefits will be taken into account as well."

      "content": "Find out where you are on the council's waiting list. When submitting your application for the waiting list, ask the council how long it will take to hear back. Contact them again after this period if you have not heard from them, to find out where you are on the waiting list. Most councils will assign you a description or a \"band number\" referring to your priority level, not a specific number on a list. In certain circumstances, you may ask for a second review of your application, or challenge the council's decision. Contact a housing adviser or the local ombudsman if you are given very low priority, denied a spot on the list, feel you were discriminated against, or the council took a long time to process your application."

Some councils allow you to apply to specific housing situations once you are on the waiting list, although you are not guaranteed to be offered one of the ones you apply for. Contact the council or councils whose waiting list you are on for more details. Typically, if the council allows it, you may find council housing properties advertised in newspapers, online, in council houses, and in libraries. You may \"bid\" for your desired housing by contacting the council, or as directed in the advertisement. Note that the bidding does not involve money, despite the name.

Even if you are not yet living on the streets, you may be eligible for higher priority as a homeless person, or for emergency housing while you wait for council housing to become available. Use this process if you are staying temporarily with friends and family, in a shelter or women's refuge, living somewhere illegally, or living in a houseboat or mobile home with no permanent place to keep it. You may also apply if you are threatened with violence in your home, threatened with eviction with 28 days, or if your current living situation is unsanitary, overcrowded, or causing you to lack the money for necessities such as food and clothing."

Contact the office and ask it to consider your homeless application. When you are invited to an interview, bring as many documents as you can to help the council make its decision. Eviction notices, tenant agreements, birth certificates, passports, and court possession notices may all speed up the process, making you eligible sooner for a higher priority spot on the waiting list for housing, and for additional assistance. If you are pregnant, bring supporting evidence and details of your child benefits. You may be eligible for additional assistance as a homeless pregnant woman."

[11] X Research source You may also apply for emergency housing directly from the council. While there may be a cost associated with this housing, you may apply for housing benefits to reduce it. \"Priority need\" can be determined by many things, including children living with you, pregnancy, homelessness due to disaster, or \"vulnerability\" due to age, illness, or past history. The council may store possessions such as furniture for you to keep them safe, until you have the space to keep them again. Councils are often reluctant to make special arrangements for pet animals, so try to make arrangements with your friends and family in advance."

If the council determines you are not homeless by choice, and that you have a local connection to the area, it will search for long-term housing for you. This includes council housing and low-cost housing association housing, as well as the possibility of an agreement with a private landlord. Note that you are unlikely to be offered council housing or housing association housing if you show \"anti-social behavior\" or are in serious rent arrears (having failed to pay a large amount of rent).

If you get permission from your council or housing association, you may exchange tenancies with someone in another council house or housing association property. Most councils maintain a list of people interested in swapping, but you usually have to visit the council office in person to see it. There are also many online swap sites, but be wary of websites that require a payment, as these may be scams."
