      "title": "Choose flowers that convey a certain message.",
      "content": "Choose flowers that convey a certain message. Red roses, for example, are a universal symbol of love and adoration. Similarly, geraniums and daffodils serve as a token of honor and friendship. Purple hyacinths and yellow carnations, on the other hand, can be used to console or extend sympathy for a difficult loss. [1] X Research source Traditionally, different colors of flowers were said to express different emotions. Red flowers signified passionate love, for instance, while white blossoms represented beauty and pink promised remembrance. [2] X Research source The magic of the gift of flowers lies not just in the act of giving but in the type of flowers given."

      "content": "Put together an arrangement in your recipient’s favorite colors. If you know the person has a preference for certain colors, narrow down your search to flowers that display those hues. You have a wide array of colors to choose from—between annual and perennial species, you can find flowers that are red, yellow, blue, purple, pink, white, and practically everything in between. Some flowers even showcase multiple shades, such as wand flower, walking iris, and harlequin blueflag. [3] X Research source If you don’t know your recipient’s favorite color, it’s usually best to go with a safe choice like red, pink, or white."

      "content": "Select seasonal varieties for timely gifts. Flowers like poinsettias and orchids are closely associated with the Christmas holidays. Likewise, warm-weather specimens with bold, bright colors like sunflowers, daisies, and peonies can perfectly capture the spirit of summer. [4] X Research source You can find different seasonal flowers on sale year-round at the florist’s, or anywhere fresh flowers are sold."

      "content": "Incorporate eye-catching filler plants. Filler plants like poms, delphinium, and eucalyptus can add depth to an otherwise plain-looking arrangement. They provide an element of delightful visual contrast, giving the eye a place to wander beyond the biggest blooms. [5] X Research source For a classier touch, go with an elegant filler like spiraling ivy or delicate baby’s breath. [6] X Research source Intersperse your secondary plants around the sides and bottom of the arrangement so they don’t draw attention away from your main flowers."

      "title": "Wrap loose bouquets in plastic.",
      "content": "Wrap loose bouquets in plastic. Lay your flowers diagonally across a sheet of plastic and fold the corners together to form a cone shape. Use tape to secure the loose edge. Once the flowers are inside, reposition them gently by hand until they look just right. Bundling flowers in plastic is a simple yet charming way to keep them together until you give them to their recipient. [7] X Research source You can also use heavy wrapping paper if you don’t have a suitable piece of plastic lying around. Never package flowers in a box, if you have a choice. Not only does this leave them more vulnerable to damage, it also prevents light from reaching them, causing them to wilt prematurely."

      "title": "Stick fresh-cut flowers in a vase to keep them looking their best.",
      "content": "Stick fresh-cut flowers in a vase to keep them looking their best. Shop around for an attractive vase that’s a good fit (both spatially and aesthetically) for the flowers you’ve selected. Fill the vase halfway up with fresh, cool water and insert the stems until they’re submerged by about 4–6 inches (10–15 cm). Arrange the flowers neatly so that the blooms are on full display. [8] X Research source For best results, use a sharp knife or pair of scissors to trim the stems of your flowers at a 45-degree angle. This will allow them to absorb more water than they could when cut straight across. Dump a packet of flower food or a couple tablespoons of sugar into the water in the vase to ensure that your flowers last as long as possible."

      "content": "Attach a personalized card. Write out a short message by hand and place it in a miniature envelope. Slip the envelope into the plastic cone the flowers are wrapped in, or tape it to the side of the vase if you decide to use a more formal container. This isn’t a required step, but it can make a nice touch, especially if you’re close with the person you’re giving the flowers to. [9] X Research source Use your card to express your feelings toward your recipient or explain why you chose the flowers you did. Many flower shops will include a custom message by request with the purchase of a bouquet."

      "content": "Create an elaborate floral arrangement. If you're really looking to make a statement, gather together an assortment of vibrant blooms in a special container like a large pot or basket. Choose from selections that are currently in season, or mix-and-match to establish a pleasant sense of contrast and assemble a uniquely thoughtful gift. Depending on the size of the arrangement, you might combine as many as half a dozen varieties of flowers. Carefully-coordinated flower arrangements make excellent gifts not just because of their impressive appearance, but because of their ease of upkeep, as well. In most cases, all the recipient will have to do is add or change the water every couple of days."

Simply walk up to your recipient, hold out a bunch of beautiful flowers you picked out with them in mind, and watch their face light up. If you want to surprise your recipient, try hiding the flowers behind your back."

      "content": "Leave the flowers where you know they’ll be discovered. If the flowers are intended for someone you live with, place them on the dining table or kitchen counter for them to find when they return home. Include a note informing the recipient of the occasion, or simply tell them that you wanted to do something nice for them later on when you see them. [10] X Research source Scattering a few rose or carnation petals over the bed can be a supremely romantic gesture for a honeymoon or anniversary. [11] X Research source To surprise a coworker or classmate, leave them on their desk so that they're the first thing they see when they arrive."

      "content": "Send the flowers by way of a delivery service. Run a quick search online to track down a business that delivers to your area. Browse their selection of premade arrangements, or piece together your own individually. Then, just provide an address and any other specific instructions for delivery and they’ll take care of the rest. [12] X Research source In addition to standalone flower delivery services, it’s not uncommon for florists to deliver their flowers for a small fee. [13] X Research source Having flowers delivered can be useful when you’re trying to surprise the recipient, or you’re not able to get your gift to them yourself."

As noted, flowers are a timeless symbol of romance, and a good way to make a great first impression. [14] X Research source For a more creative alternative to the traditional roses, an arrangement made up of tulips, stargazer lilies, or assorted wildflowers. Flowers aren’t just for first dates—they’re a touching offering that will be happily accepted on the third, eight, or hundred-and-fifteenth."

Red roses are the most popular option, of course, but they’re not your only one. Handing your significant other a bundle of multicolored chrysanthemums or dahlias can also be a great way to pledge your undying devotion. Foregoing roses in favor of less common varieties of flowers will both help you stand out and save you some money, as the price of roses tends to skyrocket during the month of February. Pair your flowers with a heartfelt card and some truffles or other sweets to complete the package."

White lilies, tulips, and azaleas are all sensible choices for honoring mom, but with so many beautiful blooms to choose from, it's hard to go wrong. If you happen to know your mom's favorite flower, make sure it's occupying the central section of the arrangement. [15] X Research source Throw in a handwritten card with your flowers and other gifts to let her how thankful you are to have her in your life.

Seasonal selections tend to work best for holiday-themed arrangements, though you'll always have faithful standbys like roses and chrysanthemums to fall back on in a pinch. Don't be afraid to think outside the box. Unusual offerings like calendula, dwarf iris, and witch hazel are sure to turn heads year-round.

The loss of a loved one can be a terribly difficult thing to face, and it’s not always easy to find the right words to express your sympathies. A tasteful arrangement or wreath of carnations, daffodils, lilies, or orchids can do it for you. Include a name tag with your flowers so the recipient will know who they’re from. [17] X Research source If you want to say a little more, consider penning a card to accompany your flowers that reads “I’m so sorry for your loss” or “In loving memory of a dear friend,” or even just “With love.”"
