      "content": "Fill a pot or tray with well-draining soil and moisten it thoroughly. Get out a nursery pot or seed tray and add soil, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top of the container. Then, water the soil so it is very moist, but not soggy. [1] X Research source It’s best to start tulsi seeds indoors in the early spring, or about 4 to 6 weeks before your area’s last expected frost date. [2] X Research source If the danger of frost is past in your area and the temperatures are staying above 50° F (10° C), feel free to sow tulsi seeds directly into your garden outside. Check out this map of average spring frost dates to find out your area’s last expected frost date."

      "content": "Place the tulsi in front of a warm, sunny window. Tulsi plants need 6-8 hours of bright sunlight each day and germinate best when temperatures are at least 68° F (20° C). Find a warm spot where the tulsi receives plenty of indirect sunlight and set down the pot or tray. [4] X Research source Be careful not to leave the plant near open windows or doors if the temperature cools down overnight. If you don’t have a sunny spot in your home, place a grow light about 4 inches (10 cm) above the tulsi. [5] X Research source To ensure the holy basil stays warm enough, place a heat mat under the pots or tray."

      "content": "Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate. Tulsi seeds typically begin to sprout within 5 to 7 days. While they’re germinating, check the soil often and water it so it stays moist, but not soggy. [6] X Research source For instance, use a spray bottle to lightly mist the surface of the soil. If you are pouring water into the pot, do so slowly and carefully so you don’t disrupt the seeds. Tip : Cover the top of the pot with plastic wrap or place it in a plastic bag to help seal in moisture. However, you still need to check the soil and add more water if it feels dry.

      "content": "Transplant the seedlings when they have 2 to 3 sets of true leaves. Keep the soil moist as the tulsi seedlings continue to grow. Once the seedlings have 2 to 3 sets of true leaves, which are the leaves that grow after the 2 round leaves the tulsi sprouts with, plant the tulsi in a larger pot or transplant them into your garden. [8] X Research source To transplant tulsi into a larger pot : Get an 8-inch (20 cm) pot that has drainage holes and fill it with well-draining soil. Carefully dig out a seedling and place it in the center of the pot. [9] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source To transplant tulsi into your garden : Find a spot that gets 6 to 8 hours of direct light and has well-draining soil (water drains quickly and doesn’t stay soggy). Carefully remove the seedlings from the tray and plant them 12 to 15 inches (30-38 cm) apart in the ground. [10] X Research source Harden off the seedlings before planting or keeping them outdoors. Start by setting them outside in partial sun for 1 hour. Then, gradually increase the amount of sun and time they stay outside over the course of 2 weeks. This prevents them from being shocked by the outdoor conditions. [11] X Research source"

Check on your plant every few days by sticking your finger 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) deep into the soil. If the top layer of soil is dry, water it.

[14] X Research source Follow the directions on your bottle of fertilizer for instructions on how to mix it up and apply it to your plant. Alternatively, sprinkle the soil with an organic compost, such as cow manure , every few weeks to fertilize your tulsi plant."

      "content": "Prune the tops of the tulsi weekly to encourage growth. The experts at Artemisia Nursery, a plant nursery and garden shop, recommend pruning holy basil “just above the node” because this causes the plant to “divide into two so it’ll continue growing in a much bushier, fuller form.” Once your tulsi has 3 sets of leaves on a stem—1 at the top and 2 on the sides—it’s safe to prune. Simply cut off the top set of leaves just above the other 2 sets of leaves. [15] X Research source"

Simply select a container that’s 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger than the old one, fill it with well-draining soil, and transfer the holy basil into the pot. [18] X Research source Depending on the size of pot you used to start, you may need to repot your tulsi plant every 1 to 2 years. Keep in mind that holy basil can grow up to 3 feet (91 cm) tall. Make sure you use a pot that’s large enough to hold the plant or transfer it into the ground where it has enough space to grow."

However, the experts at Artemisia Nursery recommend harvesting basil by cutting the stems “just above a node” and a pair of leaves. This allows “for new growth to continue to emerge” and gives you a “denser, bushier plant that's ultimately healthier and more productive.” Aim to harvest tulsi in the morning after the dew dries, as this is when the leaves have the highest oil concentration. Only harvest up to ⅓ of the plant at a time. Then, let it regrow before you harvest it again. [25] X Research source"

[27] X Research source Once the leaves are dry, remove them from the stems, place them in an airtight container, and store them in a cool, dark place (like your pantry). Wash and pat the tulsi leaves dry before hanging them up to dry . Alternatively, dry the leaves in your oven or a food dehydrator.

Some studies indicate that tulsi can decrease blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation, improve healing, and alleviate stress. [32] X Research source For instance, make tulsi into an essential oil and use it in candles and soaps. Or, make a tulsi tincture or take tulsi supplements. Tulsi is considered a sacred herb in Ayurvedic medicine and Hinduism due to its purported health benefits and significance to spiritual rituals. In fact, it’s commonly called “The Mother Medicine of Nature” and “The Queen of Herbs.” [33] X Research source Warning : Talk to your doctor about using tulsi before taking supplements or other medicines.
