      "title": "Wear long-sleeve tops.",
      "content": "Wear long-sleeve tops. Wear your bangles over your sleeves to make them fit more tightly around your arms. Thicker fabrics, such as a knit sweater, will create a tighter fit than thinner fabrics, such as a silk blouse."

    {
      "title": "Stack your bracelets.",
      "content": "Stack your bracelets. Put large, tighter fitting bracelets above and below the bangle on your wrist so the loose bangle has less space to move about. Stacking lots of bangles also gives the bangles less space to slide on your arm."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the bangles together with a ribbon.",
      "content": "Tie the bangles together with a ribbon. Cut a piece of decorative ribbon and thread it through the bangles you want to wear. Double knot the ribbon around the bangles to secure them into one large bracelet. You can tie the ends in a bow or leave them loose. The thicker width of this new larger bangle will keep your bracelets from sliding around your wrists as much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze bangles for a tighter fit.",
      "content": "Squeeze bangles for a tighter fit. If you don’t mind distorting your bangles, squeeze them between your thumb and forefinger when the bracelet is already on your wrist. This will create an oval shape that fits your arm more closely. You may need to squeeze the bangle the other way a little when you want to take the bracelet off. This technique will only work for metal bangles, which have some give. Plastic bangles may snap. Distorting bangles often over time may weaken them and cause them to break."

      "title": "Take the bangle to a jeweler to get it tightened.",
      "content": "Take the bangle to a jeweler to get it tightened. Ask a local jeweler if they can remove some of the bangle’s length for a tighter fit. They can advise how much of the bracelet to remove, the cost, and whether this kind of alternation makes sense. If your bracelet is made of a precious metal, such as gold or platinum, this professional method of resizing is your best option for less sliding Some bracelets with intricate designs may not be able to be resized. Your jeweler can advise you based on the specific piece."

      "title": "Use your bangle as the base for a cloth bracelet.",
      "content": "Use your bangle as the base for a cloth bracelet. Cut a decorative piece of cloth about double the circumference of your bangle. Knot one end of the strip around the bangle, and wrap the loose end around the bangle as many times as you like, knotting again at the end. [1] X Research source The added width will make your bangle fit more snugly and keep it from sliding so much. Layer different strips of ribbon, cloth, or even beads to add panache to your bangle. Layering many pieces will make your bangle even more snug, and give you a boho look."

      "title": "Measure your hand circumference.",
      "content": "Measure your hand circumference. Press your thumb across your palm so it touches the base of your pinky. Take a measuring tape or a piece of string, and measure around your hand at the widest point, usually around the knuckles. If you’ve used a string, measure it against a ruler to get the circumference of your hand. [2] X Research source Because bangles need to slide over the hand to be worn on the wrist, wrist size is less relevant to a proper bangle fit."

      "title": "Use your hand circumference to select the right size.",
      "content": "Use your hand circumference to select the right size. Traditional Indian bangle sizes are made to accommodate a hand of a particular circumference or smaller. If your hand circumference is close to a given measurement but a little over, it’s best to size up for the most comfortable fit. [3] X Research source Bangle size 2-2 is for a circumference of 6.67 in (1694 mm) or less; size 2-4 is for measurements of 7.06 in (179.6 mm) or less; size 2-6 is for measurements of 7.64 in (189.5 mm) or less; size 2-8 is for measurements of 7.85 in (199.4 mm) or less. Bangle size 2-10 is for measurements of 8.24 in (209.3 mm) or less; size 2-12 is for measurements of 8.64 in (219.5 mm) or less; size 2-14 is for measurements of 9.03 in (229.4 mm) or less; and size 3 is for measurements of 9.42 in (239.3 mm) or less.

      "content": "Use a well-fitting bangle as a guide. When you shop for new bangles, wear a bangle of yours that fits you well. Measure any potential purchases against your “perfect fit” bangle to see if the new bangle is a good size for you or not. A well-fitting bangle should fit comfortably over your hand, but not fit so loosely it falls off your hand when your arm is at your side."

      "content": "Try bangles on later in the day or after exercise. Shop for bangles when your hand is at its most swollen. Since bangles need to fit over your hand, it’s best to shop during or after the everyday activities that cause swelling rather than first thing in the morning. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you don’t mind squeezing your bangle over your hand in favor of a more snug bracelet, you can ignore this swelling and shop whenever’s good for you."
