      "title": "Go with jalapenos for a spicy infused tequila.",
      "content": "Go with jalapenos for a spicy infused tequila. Fresh jalapenos contain a chemical called capsaicin, which is what gives them their spice. Choosing jalapenos will infuse your tequila with heat and a refreshing, but subtle flavor. [1] X Research source Jalapenos also contain vitamin C, which gives your metabolism a boost! Capsaicin is also an anti-inflammatory substance that can improve digestion and may help prevent certain cancers.

      "title": "Use fresh pineapple for a tropical variety.",
      "content": "Use fresh pineapple for a tropical variety. Pineapple adds natural sweetness and a tropical flavor to your tequila, making it great for cocktails and tasty margaritas. If you’re looking for a naturally sweet and flavorful infusion, pineapple is the choice for you. [3] X Research source You can use canned pineapple, but cutting up a fresh one will be more flavorful. You could also go with mango for a tropical vibe."

    {
      "title": "Pick fresh fruit for a sweeter infusion.",
      "content": "Pick fresh fruit for a sweeter infusion. Fresh fruit like strawberries or watermelon have a lot of natural juices that will infuse into the tequila, making it both delicious and refreshing. They also contain natural sugars that will sweeten the tequila. [4] X Research source You could choose any fresh fruit that you enjoy such as blueberries, blackberries, kiwi, or even cucumber (yes, cucumber is a fruit)!"

      "title": "Mix multiple ingredients for a complex flavor.",
      "content": "Mix multiple ingredients for a complex flavor. For an infused tequila with a depth of flavor profiles, mix and match ingredients that you love. Make a berry-powered infusion by using blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries. You could also go fully tropical by combining pineapple and mango. Add an even further layer by mixing in some spicy jalapenos for some heat. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a 100% agave Blanco tequila for a smooth flavor.",
      "content": "Choose a 100% agave Blanco tequila for a smooth flavor. Blanco, also called silver or white tequila, has a mild flavor that won’t overpower the ingredients you use to infuse it. Use pure or 100% agave tequila so it’s smooth and won’t burn as much. [6] X Research source Cheaper tequila that isn’t 100% agave hasn’t been filtered as much, which makes it more harsh to drink and can even cause a more severe hangover."

      "title": "Add your fruit or peppers into a 1 US quart (0.95 L) sealable jar.",
      "content": "Add your fruit or peppers into a 1 US quart (0.95 L) sealable jar. If you’re using jalapenos, thinly slice 3-4 of them and add them into the bottom of the jar. If you’re using berries, such as blueberries or strawberries, cut up about 1 cup (100 grams) of them and add them to the jar. For larger fruit such as cucumber, watermelon, or pineapple, fill the jar about halfway full. [7] X Research source If you want more heat, add 5-6 jalapenos. There really isn’t such a thing as adding too much fruit to an infusion! A mason jar or a glass jar with a lid will work perfectly and you can find them at your local craft or department store. You could also order them online."

      "title": "Fill the jar with 1 US quart (0.95 L) of tequila and seal the lid.",
      "content": "Fill the jar with 1 US quart (0.95 L) of tequila and seal the lid. Once you’ve added in your other ingredients, fill the jar to the rim with your Blanco tequila. Close the lid tightly so it won’t leak out when you shake it. [8] X Research source Leaving the lid open can cause the fruit to rot, so be sure to seal it tightly."

      "title": "Let the tequila infuse for at least 16 hours and shake it every 3-4 hours.",
      "content": "Let the tequila infuse for at least 16 hours and shake it every 3-4 hours. Place the tequila on your counter away from direct light so it doesn’t heat up too much. Leave it alone for at least a full day and give the jar a good shake ever few hours so the fruit breaks down quicker and the juices infuse with the tequila. [9] X Research source For an even better infusion, let it soak for 2-3 days."

    {
      "title": "Strain the infusion and store it in your refrigerator for up to 3 months.",
      "content": "Strain the infusion and store it in your refrigerator for up to 3 months. Use a wire strainer and pour the infusion through it into a bowl or another jar to remove all of the large pieces from it. Make tasty cocktails or margaritas with your infusion or pour it into a glass with a few cubes of ice to drink it on its own! Close the lid tightly when you aren’t using it and stick it in your fridge. It’ll keep for a few months, but always give it a good sniff before you drink it to make sure it hasn’t gone off. [10] X Research source Keeping large pieces of fruit in your infusion will cause it to go off quicker. Please, always drink responsibly and never drive after drinking."
