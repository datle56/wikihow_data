      "title": "Part your hair.",
      "content": "Part your hair. To start, brush out your hair and use a comb to make a neat side part. You can part your hair on whichever side most flatters your face type. The smaller side of the side part should be about one to two inches (2.5 to 3 centimeters)."

    {
      "title": "Section off the side part.",
      "content": "Section off the side part. Once the side part is in place, use hair clips or hair ties to section off the smaller portion of your hair. Leave your hair sectioned off as you proceed to work with the bigger half of the side part."
    },
    {
      "title": "Back brush your hair.",
      "content": "Back brush your hair. Use a comb to gently back brush your hair near the crown of your head. To back brush, you brush your hair from the tips to the roots to tease your hair. This adds volume and texture, giving you a retro style reflective of the big hair trends of the '80s. When you're done, spritz on some hairspray to set the style. A rat tail comb can work well for this. You may also want to use bobby pins to keep your teased hair in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smooth out the front of your hair.",
      "content": "Smooth out the front of your hair. Turn your brush upside down and use the back of your brush to work the front of your hair over your teased hair. This will make your hair look smoother and create a bouffant effect near the front."

      "title": "Pull your hair into a ponytail.",
      "content": "Pull your hair into a ponytail. You can remove the side part from the hair clips. Gather all your hair into a single ponytail. Secure it with an elastic hair tie. Choose a hair tie that is wrapped in material."

    {
      "title": "Curl your ponytail.",
      "content": "Curl your ponytail. Take a curling iron. Curl your ponytail into one single strand. Hold it for a couple of seconds before releasing it. You should be left with a curly ponytail with puffy hair near the front. It's a good idea to mist your hair with hairspray to set your ponytail. If you have thick hair, you may not be able to fit all of your hair into the curling iron to curl it as one big curl. In this case, divide the ponytail into 2-4 sections and curl each in the same direction. Once all of the sections are curled, you can use your fingers to combine them into one curl."

      "title": "Get a hair rat.",
      "content": "Get a hair rat. A hair rat is a clump of real or fake hair rolled into a cylinder shape. It's meant to be rolled into your hair to create things like bangs or a bump. You can buy fake hair rats online or at a beauty supply shop. You can also gather your own hair from your brush and ball it into a hair rat over time. A hair rat made of your own hair will blend easier into your hair."

    {
      "title": "Separate your hair to create bangs.",
      "content": "Separate your hair to create bangs. To start, brush a portion of your hair over your forehead. Use about three quarters of your hair. Tie back the remainder of your hair. Mist your bangs with hairspray to create a smooth finish."
