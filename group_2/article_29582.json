      "title": "Collect your ingredients.",
      "content": "Collect your ingredients. You will want peanut butter, some preserves or jelly, and some bread. You may also want to grab some butter, as butter can enhance the flavor of the sandwich. There are lots of different kinds of bread and spreads to choose from, so you'll have to do a little experimenting to know what you like. Lots of types of peanut butter come with lots of added sugar and partially hydrogenated oils that are bad for your health. [2] X Research source If you're looking for a healthier option, try an organic peanut butter. Ideally, peanut butter should only contain peanuts and no other ingredients, like sugar or salt. Natural peanut butter may have a layer of oil on top, but if you carefully stir it in when you open the jar and then keep the jar of peanut butter in the refrigerator, the oil will not separate out again. You can also store the jar upside down to prevent separation. There are lots and lots of flavors for jellies and jams. The two most commonly used are grape and strawberry. However, you could branch out to a sharper taste like raspberry, or a mixture of several different kinds. For your bread you'll probably want something that doesn't overwhelm your other flavors (like a rye or sourdough), so you'll probably want to use white bread. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread peanut butter evenly onto one slice of bread using a knife. You'll decide how much peanut butter you want, but if you're going to be taking the sandwich somewhere, you'll probably want to go a little light on the peanut butter, otherwise it will get everywhere before you get to eat it. [4] X Research source Stir your peanut butter beforehand to soften it and make it easier to spread on the bread slice. Another tip for spreading peanut butter, especially the kind with peanuts in it, is to put some of the peanut butter in a bowl and microwave it on high for about 20 seconds. It will spread on the bread like soft butter. If you do use butter, you'll put the butter on the same slice of bread as the peanut butter before you put the peanut butter on."

      "content": "Toast your bread . This will give your sandwich a little more crunch and a little more taste. It is also helpful when spreading peanut butter, because it doesn't tear as easily as regular bread. [6] X Research source You could also try using biscuits instead of bread, because the peanut butter and jelly would spread really nicely and there would be a little different taste."

Put on plate, cut in half, and eat! [7] X Research source"
