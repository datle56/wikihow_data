      "content": "Lemon juice can lighten your hair a little bit. Mix equal parts of lemon juice and water in a small bowl. Use a clean spoolie or mascara wand to swipe the mixture onto your hair to give yourself highlights. If you want an overall lift, pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spritz it all over your hair. Wait 15 to 30 minutes, then wash your hair with cool water and shampoo. Lemon juice can be a little drying, so use a conditioning treatment or hair mask afterwards to keep your ends healthy. [1] X Research source If swiping the mixture onto your hair is too difficult, combine your ingredients in a spray bottle and spritz it onto your damp hair. Lemon juice might only lift your hair a shade or two, and that’s if you start off a light brown or blonde already. If you notice any yellow or brassy tones, use purple shampoo to even out your color."

[2] X Research source Apple cider vinegar is also a natural way to remove dirt and product buildup from your hair. Your hair will probably only lighten a shade or two with apple cider vinegar.

      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide is a lightener that’s much less damaging than bleach. Rinse your hair in the shower and pat it dry so that it’s still slightly damp. Pour hydrogen peroxide into a spray bottle, then spritz it onto your hair where you’d like to lighten it. For highlights, use a cotton ball instead and swipe it onto 1 in (2.5 cm) sections of hair. Leave the hydrogen peroxide in for 30 minutes, then rinse your hair with cool water. [3] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide can be slightly drying, so use a deep conditioner or hair mask afterwards. Hydrogen peroxide will only lighten your hair 1 to 2 shades. If your hair turns yellow or brassy, use purple shampoo to even out your color."

      "title": "Raw honey contains trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide, so it can gently lighten your hair.",
      "content": "Raw honey contains trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide, so it can gently lighten your hair. To make a natural hair lightening solution, mix 4 tbsp (86 g) of raw honey into 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of water until well blended. Then, massage the mixture into your hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap and let it sit for 2-3 hours–the longer you leave the honey on your hair, the lighter it will get. When you’re finished, rinse out the mixture completely with cool water, and use conditioner if your hair feels dry. [4] X Research source If you’re worried about drying out your hair, add 1 to 2 tsp (4.9 to 9.9 mL) of olive oil or coconut oil to the honey-water mixture for extra hydration. [5] X Research source You can apply the honey all over your head, or you can target specific areas where you want to add highlights, like the ends. If you have thick hair, divide your hair into upper and lower sections to ensure your mixture is evenly distributed. [6] X Research source"

If you want to add a few highlights or lighten your hair just a little, head out to the beach and leave your hair down. Over time, your hair will naturally start to lighten up. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Lighten your hair more noticeably with bleach. Brush your hair and make sure it’s tangle free, then gather your hair into 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) vertical sections. Use clips or hair ties to keep each section in its place, and take them down one at a time to apply your bleach. Then, mix 1 parts bleach to 2 parts developer in a plastic hair dye bowl and apply the mixture to your roots with a hair dye brush. [9] X Research source Let the bleach sit for 20-45 minutes, and then rinse it off in the shower with cool water. [10] X Research source Bleach is fairly damaging, so use a deep conditioner or a hair mask on your hair to add some hydration. Always check the box to confirm how long the bleach should stay on your hair. Combat yellow or brassy-looking hair by purchasing a purple or blue hair toner and mixing it with a developer in a hair dye bowl. Apply the toner to your hair with a hair dye brush, then let it sit for about 20 minutes before rinsing it out.
