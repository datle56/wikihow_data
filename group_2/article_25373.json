This feels like testicular pain on one side that gradually gets worse over several hours. [2] X Research source The pain may feel acute and limited to one spot on the testicle at first, but may expand over the entire testicle. See a doctor right away if you feel a sudden burst of pain in both testicles. This likely isn’t due to epididymitis and may indicate a medical emergency. The first symptoms of epididymitis usually show within 24 hours of contracting the infection. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source As the infection spreads, the scrotum may swell up to 4 times its usual size. [5] X Research source The swelling is typically accompanied by pain or discomfort that might feel acute and sharp or diffuse and dull.

It’s also common to feel like you have to urinate much more frequently or with more urgency, similar to a urinary tract infection. [6] X Research source In some cases, you may also see blood in your urine or semen. Painful urination is a common symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It’s possible that a UTI spread to the epididymis, causing epididymitis. If you have a UTI and not epididymitis, there won’t be any testicular or scrotal pain and swelling."

More than 80% of cases in men under 39 years old are caused by sexually transmitted infections, with chlamydia and gonorrhea being the most common. [11] X Research source Chlamydia is responsible for around 60% of STI-caused epididymitis cases.
