[1] X Research source They might go out of their way to not talk to you, turn down invitations, claim they’re busy, or have lots of excuses as to why they can’t hang out. It may be because they’re uncomfortable interacting with you. Keep in mind that everyone has their own preferences. If one person avoids you but others don’t, you just might not click with them, and that’s okay!"

The other person might be upset with you for reasons they can’t or won’t say. [6] X Research source Remember, when in doubt, ask! Has your co-worker stopped chatting with you over your morning coffee? Consider asking them if everything is okay. If your best friend no longer invites you over for movie night, ask what is going on. Do people abruptly leave or end conversations when you come by? When you start talking, do people try to end the conversation as quickly as possible?"

[7] X Research source Are they always smiling and laughing with you, so much that it seems excessive? Do they go far out of their way to do you favors? Do they tend to flatter you so much it makes you uncomfortable? Be careful not to confuse this with someone being genuinely nice! If they’re generally also nice to other people, they’re probably just a kind person."

If your answer is a yes, they might be irritated. Maybe you realize that you often try to get out of doing your fair share of work during group projects at school. Your classmates are probably tired of this behavior. Maybe your job at home is to take out the trash. If you constantly beg your sister to do it for you, she might be annoyed."

Complaining can sometimes help you deal with your feelings, but only in moderation. If you spend a lot of time complaining, people may not enjoy the conversation very much. You might be irritating if you constantly say, \"Yes, but...\" For example, if a co-worker makes a suggestion and you say, \"Yes, but the client would hate that,\" that can make them feel their ideas aren't appreciated. It's also negative if you can't take a compliment . For instance, if someone compliments you, don't say, \"Thanks for complimenting my cooking, but the chicken was really too dry and the sauce was bland!\""

[22] X Research source For example, in a 10-minute conversation, you shouldn't be doing more than 5 minutes of the talking. Make sure that you only talk when you have something of value to add to the conversation. For example, if your friends are talking about how much they love yoga, you don't need to interrupt to say, \"But really, spinning is so much better!\" Don't feel a constant need to talk. For example, if the person next to you on the bus is reading a book, you don't have to pepper them with questions like, \"What's that about? Is it good? Why is that picture on the cover?\" While it's okay to be friendly, it's also good to notice whether people are receptive. Sometimes, they need quiet time and would prefer to be left alone."

If you've realized that you’re guilty of this, explore some ways to correct the problem. For example, ask other people questions about themselves. [23] X Research source If you're talking about how much you loved a certain TV show, take time to ask the other person what their favorite show is, too. If you notice you've been talking about yourself a lot, pause and ask a question about the other person, such as \"So how has your day been?\" When someone is telling a story, try not to always jump in and say, \"I had the same thing happen to me!\" It's okay to empathize, but it's also okay to let other people steer the conversation. Notice whether the other person is asking questions.
