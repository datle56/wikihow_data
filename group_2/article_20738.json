Look around from there and you'll see a path leading up a cliff, which will take you to the Village. Once you get to the Site of Grace in the Village, head up the slope to the east. At the end of the path is a cliff and a pot. Attack the pot to reveal Albus and talk to him to get your medallion. He tells you to seek an \"Albinauric Woman,\" whom you can find in the Lakeside Crystal Cave; but you don't need to talk to her to continue with this guide. He merely points you in the right direction if you don't know where to go next. If you haven't completed any of the main story quests, you need to do that before you can continue. You'll have enough of the main story completed once you have at least 2 Great Runes, reached Mountaintop of the Giants, and can defeat the main boss of the Royal Capital."

Use the right armor for powerful physical attacks . You'll encounter 2 types of damage: lightning and physical. Summon your own spirits . Commander Niall summons 2 spirits during his fight, so you should get some help as well. Kill the dual-sword spirit immediately . Since dodging attacks from 3 enemies is tough, make your life a little easier by getting rid of one that does the most damage. Keep the shield-spirit around as long as you can . If you've summoned spirits, they will focus on the shield-spirit, leaving you to focus on Commander Niall. If you defeat both spirits immediately, Phase 2 triggers ahead-of-schedule, which makes the fight harder for you."
