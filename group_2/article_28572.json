      "content": "Roll a 7 by 9 in (18 by 23 cm) piece of thin cardboard into a cone. Starting at the bottom right corner of the cardboard, roll the cardboard toward the left bottom corner. Make sure to roll it tightly. Roll it until a cone shape forms. Place duct tape around the end of the cone to secure it. Use your hands to adjust the cardboard to get the perfect cone shape."

      "content": "Tape the cone to the bottom of a 20-ounce (591-mL) soda bottle. Place the bottom of the soda bottle in the cone. Tape the edges of the cone to the bottom of the bottle to hold it in place. Use 2 to 3 layers of tape to secure the cone to the bottom of the bottle. If the cone is too large for the bottle, then trim the opening of the cone until it is just the right size."

      "title": "Add rocket fins to the bottle.",
      "content": "Add rocket fins to the bottle. Cut out a 5 by 6 in (13 by 15 cm) piece of cardboard. Fold the cardboard in half. Use scissors to cut a diagonal across the cardboard to make 2 triangles. Then cut the triangles in half to make 4 right triangles. Choose 3 to be the fins. Attach the fins to the bottle by: Folding the long edge of each right triangle by 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Cutting 2 slits, 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart along the creased edge to make 3 tabs. Folding the middle tab backward. Taping each fins’ tabs to the bottle using duct tape."

      "content": "Mark a spot 5 inches (13 cm) from the end of a PVC pipe. Use a permanent marker to do this. The mark will indicate where you need to cut the pipe. Make sure the circumference of the pipe is large enough so that the top of the soda bottle can fit inside. You can purchase PVC pipe from your local hardware store."

      "title": "Ask an adult to cut the pipe.",
      "content": "Ask an adult to cut the pipe. An adult should complete this step to prevent injuries. Place the pipe on a sturdy work surface. Hold the pipe firmly with 1 hand and place a hacksaw on the mark. Slowly move the saw back and forth to cut the pipe. [1] X Research source Have another person hold the other end of the pipe to keep it steady while you cut, or use clamps to hold the pipe in place."

      "title": "Place the opening of the bottle inside the PVC pipe.",
      "content": "Place the opening of the bottle inside the PVC pipe. The cone side of the bottle should be pointed toward the ceiling at this point. Check to see that the opening of the bottle inside the PVC pipe is not touching the ground. The PVC pipe should be propping the bottle up off of the ground. If the opening of the bottle is touching the ground, then you will need to cut a larger piece of PVC pipe."

      "content": "Make a baking soda packet. Place a heaping 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of baking soda in the center of a paper towel. Fold and roll the paper towel into a small packet. Make sure the baking soda is securely packed inside. Additionally, the packet should be small enough so it can fit inside the soda bottle. [3] X Research source The paper towel acts as a time release. This way, you will have enough time to step away from the rocket before it explodes. If the paper towel breaks, exposing the baking soda, then use a new paper towel."
