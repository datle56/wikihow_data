      "title": "Pick a theme.",
      "content": "Pick a theme. If you want it to be Christmas-related, a snowman or pine tree might work. If it's for a birthday, try a small toy. For a personalized snow globe, try a heavily laminated photo, glued to a cork or another base. Make sure your figure is waterproof and fits on the jar lid and inside the jar. Ensure there's a good flat surface to glue down. [1] X Research source Ceramic or plastic are good bets. If you're not sure, place your figurine in a bowl of water for a few hours and see if anything happens. You can also make your own figure out of sculpey clay. It's easy to find in craft stores and comes in a variety of colors. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Find a good jar.",
      "content": "Find a good jar. Any size can work, from a baby food jar to a spaghetti sauce jar to a large mason jar. Make sure there are no cracks and that it can be closed tightly. Test out the seal on your jar ahead of time. Fill it with water, close it tightly and turn it over—nothing should leak out. Wash your jar with hot, soapy water, remove any labels or glue remaining, and make sure it's totally dry before proceeding. You'll also need a place your craft can dry overnight, undisturbed. Once you've got a figure and a jar, try placing it in different positions to figure out what looks best and which side you should glue down."

    {
      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. Most craft stores or general retailers will have anything you don't already have at home. Besides a jar and a figurine, you'll also need: Waterproof craft glue or epoxy Glitter or fake snow Bottled water, which is less likely to cloud up Glycerin or baby oil (optional, but it thickens the water and makes the “snow” fall more slowly)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Position your figurine.",
      "content": "Position your figurine. Remove the lid from your jar and find out where you want to place your figurine. Model it in different positions and try the jar over top. Once you have found the right pose, apply your adhesive sealant to the bottom of the figurine. Then, press the figurine down onto the lid, and hold it for about 2-5 seconds depending on the size."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let it dry.",
      "content": "Let it dry. It could take up to 24 hours, but check your glue packaging for drying times. Find a place to set it where it won't be disturbed. Make sure the figurine on your lid is nice and secure before proceeding."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the jar with water.",
      "content": "Fill the jar with water. Bottled water is ideal and will be clearer. Leave a little room at the top for glycerin, glitter and space for your figurine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the glycerin.",
      "content": "Add the glycerin. Use a few drops to about a teaspoon, depending on how big your jar is. Glycerin is optional, but will let your glitter or \"snow\" fall down more slowly. Baby oil should accomplish the same thing. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour in some glitter.",
      "content": "Pour in some glitter. Using plastic glitter, sprinkle 1-2 teaspoons into the water. You may want to use more for a bigger jar, but don't overdo it or your snow globe will look hazy. Use a long-handled spoon to mix well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal the lid.",
      "content": "Seal the lid. Keeping the glass jar right side up, just place your lid onto the top of the jar, and seal it. If there's any extra water, it might leak a little, but that's okay. Turn it over gently and see if there are any leaks. Check for extra space at the top, too, and turn the jar back over and add a little more water if needed. Let it sit for a few days to make sure there are no slow leaks or problems. Once you're sure everything is good, you may want to glue your jar shut permanently with epoxy or hot glue."

      "content": "Shake it up. Shake your snow globe gently and enjoy your lovely craft! Display it on a windowsill, bookshelf or anywhere else you'd like to show off your handiwork."
