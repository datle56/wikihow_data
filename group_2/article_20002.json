      "content": "Blot your hair with paper towels. Take a few paper towels and press them on the hair that's coated with Vaseline. Dab and blot with the paper towels to remove the excess Vaseline. [1] X Research source Ensure that you don't rub the paper towels which would work the petroleum deeper into your hair. If you're trying to get Vaseline out of your own hair, you may want to ask a friend to help you blot the areas you can't see yourself such as the back of your head."

      "title": "Sprinkle cornstarch, baking soda, or cornmeal powder into the hair.",
      "content": "Sprinkle cornstarch, baking soda, or cornmeal powder into the hair. Once you've removed the excess Vaseline, coat the greasy hair with cornstarch, baking soda, or cornmeal powder. Use paper towels or your fingers to lightly pat the powder into your hair so the greasy area is completely coated. [2] X Research source Avoid using baby powder or crushed talc. If you accidentally inhale them, the talc will cause respiratory problems."

      "title": "Wash your hair with warm water and clarifying shampoo.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with warm water and clarifying shampoo. While you can use your regular shampoo to try to remove the Vaseline, use 1 that's labeled deep-cleansing or clarifying. These stronger shampoos are made to strip hair and styling products from your hair. Don't use cold water to wash your hair since this can make the Vaseline clump and thicken."

      "title": "Shampoo and rinse your hair again.",
      "content": "Shampoo and rinse your hair again. Once you've rinsed out the cornstarch and clarifying shampoo, shampoo your hair 1 more time. Rinse the hair with warm water to remove even more Vaseline. [3] X Research source Keep rinsing until the water runs clear instead of cloudy or soapy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a conditioner and rinse it out.",
      "content": "Apply a conditioner and rinse it out. Because clarifying shampoos can strip your hair of its natural oils and dry it out, use a moisturizing conditioner. Follow the product instructions, then rinse the conditioner out with cool water to seal the hair cuticle. [4] X Research source For example, some conditioners will direct you to massage it into wet hair for a few minutes and then let the conditioner rest in your hair for a few more minutes before you rinse it out."

    {
      "title": "Blot your hair dry and comb your hair.",
      "content": "Blot your hair dry and comb your hair. Press towels against your wet hair to blot most of the moisture. Don't rub or pull on your hair to avoid damaging it. Once your hair is damp, use a comb to detangle it. [5] X Research source You shouldn't feel any Vaseline in your hair or on the comb."

    {
      "title": "Repeat the process in 12 to 24 hours if necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat the process in 12 to 24 hours if necessary. If your hair still feels greasy and you don't think you got all of the Vaseline out, wait 12 to 24 hours. Then apply more cornstarch to the greasy areas, wash your hair with clarifying shampoo, rinse it out, and condition your hair. [6] X Research source Remember to blot your hair dry and let it finish drying on its own."

    {
      "title": "Massage your hair with oil for 10 minutes before you shampoo.",
      "content": "Massage your hair with oil for 10 minutes before you shampoo. To make the shampoo more effective at removing the Vaseline, get oil from your pantry. Rub 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, baby oil, or almond oil into the greasy part of your hair. Then wash your hair a few times with a clarifying shampoo. [7] X Research source Massaging the oil will work it deep into the Vaseline-coated hair. This will make the clarifying shampoo more effective at lifting the Vaseline. If you choose to use coconut oil, make sure you warm it in the microwave just long enough for it to melt. This usually takes 15-20 seconds."

      "title": "Use a skin-safe grease or adhesive remover.",
      "content": "Use a skin-safe grease or adhesive remover. Buy a product that's safe to use on your skin such as Goo Gone. These removers are designed to dilute and lift grease and may be able to break down the oil in the petroleum. Squirt about 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of the product into your hand and rub it through the greasy area. Rinse off the remover with warm water until the water runs clear. Although the remover should be safe for your skin, ensure that it doesn't get into your eyes, nose, or ears."

      "title": "Use liquid dish soap with degreaser to cut through the oil.",
      "content": "Use liquid dish soap with degreaser to cut through the oil. Squirt a few spoonfuls of the liquid dish soap into the palms of your hands and rub it through the greasy hair. Rinse the soap out with warm water until the water runs clear and there aren't any bubbles. Consider using a conditioner after using the dish soap because the dish soap will strip your hair of its natural oils. Be careful not to get any detergent in your eyes. Try using a detachable shower head to rinse your hair. This way you can hold it up to your scalp and use your free hand to shield your eyes."
