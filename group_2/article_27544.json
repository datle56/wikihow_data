Keep your first tightly curled for the next step. [3] X Research source You can also apply the paint to your fist with a paintbrush. If you are using an ink pad, simply plunk your fist down onto it. Another option be to coat the bottom of a tiny shoe (i.e.: doll or baby) with paint."

[5] X Research source You can make them resemble a real footprint even more by making them get smaller and smaller, towards the side edge of the foot. Be mindful about the placement. The edge of your palm is the outer edge of the foot. That's where the pinkie toe goes! If you are using an ink pad, you will need to reapply the ink often."

A messy and hungry leprechaun may leave a trail of the cereal he was munching on. A mischievous leprechaun would leave some prints on the fridge. He might even tint the milk green with food coloring.

If your child built a leprechaun trap, consider ending the tracks there, and leaving a small gift for the child to find. Here are some ideas to get you started: For a nice leprechaun, leave a pile of gold coins (preferably chocolate) at the end of the trail. A creative leprechaun might leave money folded into an interesting shape, such as a ring or airplane. A forgetful leprechaun might leave behind a plastic pot of gold coins, Lucky Charms, or Skittles."
