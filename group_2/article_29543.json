      "title": "Cut a piece of paper in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of paper in half lengthwise. Take any 8.5 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) piece paper and fold it in half lengthwise so it looks long and skinny. Origami expert Rob Homayoon says to place the paper on a flat surface and use your thumbnail to make a crease at the fold. Unfold the paper once you've made a defined crease. Then, use scissors to cut along the vertical crease. [1] X Research source If you don’t have any scissors, tear the paper in half by holding the left and right sides and gently pulling them in opposite directions. When you’re finished, you’ll have 2 strips of paper that are 4.25 by 11 inches (10.8 cm × 27.9 cm), but you’ll only need 1 of them to make your paper football."

      "title": "Fold 1 of the strips in half lengthwise.",
      "content": "Fold 1 of the strips in half lengthwise. Lay the strip of paper on a table so a long edge faces you. Start by folding the bottom left corner up toward the top left corner. Afterwards, bring the bottom right corner up to the top right corner. Make sure the long edges are flush before flattening the fold. [2] X Research source To get nice crisp folds, origamist Coco Sato says to press the crease down with your fingernail. If you want a tighter fold, she recommends using a bone folder , ruler, or butter knife. The strip will now be 2.13 in × 11 in (5.4 cm × 27.9 cm) and twice as thick."

    {
      "title": "Fold the lower left corner to the right edge of the paper.",
      "content": "Fold the lower left corner to the right edge of the paper. Turn your paper so one of the short edges is closest to you. This fold should form a triangle. Make sure the right side of the triangle is flush with the long edge on the right. The top edge of the triangle will be perpendicular to the paper’s long edges. [3] X Research source The triangle corners on the left side and bottom will be 45° angles, while the top right corner will be a 90° angle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the triangle up along the top edge to start folding the football.",
      "content": "Flip the triangle up along the top edge to start folding the football. Use the top edge of the triangle as a guide on where to make the next fold. Bring the bottom corner of the triangle up so the right edge of the triangle and paper stay flush. Crease the new fold along the bottom. After this step, the triangle will become thicker and the 90° corner will be in the bottom right. [4] X Research source Keep the folds tight so your paper football keeps its shape and doesn’t fall apart."

    {
      "title": "Continue folding the triangle up the strip until you reach the end.",
      "content": "Continue folding the triangle up the strip until you reach the end. Next, fold the triangle along the angled side to bring the 90° corner to the left edge of the paper. Keep folding the triangle by its top edge up toward the top of the strip until you run out of paper. [5] X Research source It’s okay if there’s a little bit of excess paper on the top of the strip that doesn’t fold into a triangle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Undo the last 2 folds of the paper.",
      "content": "Undo the last 2 folds of the paper. Unfold the triangle a couple of times so excess paper at the top of the strip makes a square or rectangle. Leave the creases in the paper to use as guides for the next step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the square end of the paper in to make a second triangle.",
      "content": "Fold the square end of the paper in to make a second triangle. Start a fold from the end of the paper you just unfolded in the last step. Follow the creases you already made to make a second triangle that’s a mirror image of the original triangle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the outer point of the new triangle.",
      "content": "Trim about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the outer point of the new triangle. Use a pair of scissors to cut off the 45° corner on the end of the second triangle. This makes it easier to fold and tuck the end in to finish the paper football. Alternatively, carefully tear the corner off by hand if you don’t have scissors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck the new triangle into the pocket on the left triangle.",
      "content": "Tuck the new triangle into the pocket on the left triangle. Gently squeeze the sides of the original folded triangle and look for the opening in the paper. Fold the second triangle over and tuck the cut or torn end into the pocket. Push the paper in as far as it will go so the paper football looks like a large right triangle. [6] X Research source If the fold isn’t tight and there’s still excess paper sticking out, untuck the triangle and trim off a little bit more paper from the end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flatten the paper football with your fingers.",
      "content": "Flatten the paper football with your fingers. Smooth down the creases of the triangle until you have a flat paper football. If you can’t get a good crease or tight fold, press down on the edges with a butter knife or ruler."

      "title": "Decorate the paper football if you want to customize it.",
      "content": "Decorate the paper football if you want to customize it. If you'd like to give your paper football a personalized touch, use a marker or pen to draw stitch marks, designs, or any other art before you start playing with it. [7] X Research source Brown markers are perfect for making your paper football look like leather, and white or gray works well for drawing in the stitches."

      "title": "Clear off a table for the playing field.",
      "content": "Clear off a table for the playing field. All you need to get started is a large flat area to play paper football , such as a table, desk, countertop, or any other space you have available. Clear everything off the surface so the paper football doesn’t bump into anything while you’re playing. Have the players stand on opposite sides of the table so they’re facing each other. [8] X Research source Paper football is normally a 2 player game, but you can split into teams and alternate who takes turns if you have a larger group."

      "title": "Toss the paper football onto the table to start the game.",
      "content": "Toss the paper football onto the table to start the game. Flip a coin to see who goes first or choose a random starting player. Whoever starts the game does a “kickoff.” They place the paper football flat in their palm. Move your hand up quickly so the tips of your fingers hit the bottom edge of the table and the paper football flies out of your palm onto the table. [9] X Research source Wherever the paper football lands on the table is where the starting player begins the game. If the paper football falls off the table, then do another kickoff."

      "content": "Flick the ball toward the other end of the table. Keep the football flat on the table. Use your thumb and forefinger to flick the football so it slides across the table toward the other player. Try to get the football as close to the edge of the table without it falling off. [10] X Research source If the paper football falls off the table, then the opposing player does a kickoff and takes a turn flicking the football."

      "content": "Score a touchdown if the football hangs off the table. If a player flicks the paper football so part of it hangs off the edge of the table without falling off, then they earn a touchdown and add 6 points to their score. Write the score down on a sheet of paper to keep track. [11] X Research source If a player doesn’t score a touchdown after flicking the ball, then the other player takes a turn flicking the ball."

      "content": "Kick the ball through goalposts to earn an extra point after a touchdown. After each touchdown, whoever scored takes the paper football and stands it up on one of the 45° corners. The other player makes “goal posts” by making L-shapes with their thumbs and forefingers. To “kick” the ball, flick the back of the paper football to try and get it through the goalposts. If the player makes it, they earn 1 extra point. [12] X Research source If you want to make your own goalposts, cut out a U-shape from a piece of cardboard and glue it to the bottom of a red party cup."
