      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. To make Ariel’s top, you’ll need 4 components – 1 strapless purple bathing suit top (or bra or bandeau), 2 large seashells, and a swath of sheer purple fabric about the size and shape of a handkerchief. [1] X Research source This is a very basic list and there are multiple ways to approach almost every element on it, so alternate options will be mentioned in each step. You can mix and match whatever works best for you to get your perfect Ariel costume. You’ll also need a sewing machine, purple thread, scissors, super glue, and light purple paint (lavender or lilac is the shade you want)."

    {
      "title": "Sew the sheer purple fabric to the bottom of your purple strapless top.",
      "content": "Sew the sheer purple fabric to the bottom of your purple strapless top. You can use a machine to do this or sew it by hand, whichever you prefer. Since it’s such a minimal amount of sewing, you could easily do it by hand if you wanted to. The sheer fabric is square-shaped, and you want one of the flat sides to be the part that gets sewn into the purple strapless top. After it’s sewn on, the sheer fabric should hang at approximately your waist, covering most of your stomach. Try it on to make sure it looks the way you want it to before proceeding. If everything looks good, set the top aside for now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Obtain 2 seashells for the top.",
      "content": "Obtain 2 seashells for the top. [2] X Research source Ariel has 2 matching seashells on her top, one on each side. They are both approximately the size of your palm. You could do a perfectly fine Ariel costume without this element, but it’s a nice detail from the movie that will really set your costume apart. Skip ahead if you’re omitting the seashell element. To do the seashells, you can use actual seashells or a light purple felt fabric cut into seashell shapes. If you want to use real seashells, check out Amazon (or another similar site). You can order them this way, and the price is relatively low. You want the shells to be about the same size, so when placing your order make sure you note that to the seller. If you live near an ocean, you can always get your shells by making a trip to the beach. If you’re using fabric for the shells, get purple felt (if possible, a shade lighter than the rest of the top is)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prep your shells.",
      "content": "Prep your shells. If you’re using real shells, you’ll need to paint them to be a light purple (lavender or lilac is the shade you want). [3] X Research source Use acrylic paint, which you can obtain at any art supply store for quite cheap. Paint the front of each shell with the purple acrylic paint and lay them on an old towel to dry. Acrylic paint takes about 20-30 minutes to dry completely. If you are using fabric for shells, simply cut the shell shapes out at the size you want (about the size of your palm). You could also use purple spray paint for the shells. [4] X Research source Feel free to add any additional elements you want to the shells. Some great ideas would be glitter, stick on rhinestones, additional painted details – whatever you like!"

      "title": "Affix your shells to the purple top.",
      "content": "Affix your shells to the purple top. You’ll use super glue to do this, whether you’re adding real shells or fabric shells. Shells have a flat bottom and a fan-shaped top. Arrange your shells with the fan-shaped tops facing outward, toward each arm, and with the flat bottoms facing each other in the middle of your chest, so that each cup of your bathing suit is covered by a shell. Super glue dries in about 30 seconds and sets in 2 minutes. When you place the shell on the top, hold it down tightly in place for the full 2 minutes before going on to the next shell."

      "content": "Gather your materials. To make Ariel’s tail and fins, you’ll need 1 large piece of green fabric and about a yard of shiny turquoise blue fabric. For the green fabric, you need a fabric that has some stretch to it. Spandex is a good choice. You’ll also need a sewing machine, green and blue thread, scissors, and about 12 inches of elastic."

      "title": "Prep the green material for the tail.",
      "content": "Prep the green material for the tail. Lay out the green fabric on the ground and have a friend trace a mermaid tail around your body with a sharpie. [5] X Research source When tracing around, make sure your friend draws the lines about 1 inch away from your body so that the final piece won’t fit too tightly. Cut the piece out of the fabric after the traced lines are drawn. You need 2 of these. Since you need two of these green pieces, you could save time and ensure the pieces are identical in size by fold the green fabric in half before you start. That way you can trace around your body and cut them both identically at the same time. When you lay down on the green fabric, you want to make sure you’re on top of it from the waist down only. The fabric needs to extend past your feet when you lay down. This is so the fins can be drawn. If you prefer, you can lay down on a large piece of paper and trace your body onto that. You'd then use that as a stencil with which to cut the fabric down to size. [6] X Research source"

Cut the split right up the middle of the fins, starting at the bottom, up to your knees [7] X Research source . This creates an opening for your feet and bottom part of your legs, so that you can walk in the costume. You can cut the split just at the bottom of the fins, so it does not show your legs."

      "content": "Sew the elastic band at the top of the fins. You’ll do this right where the green tail meets the blue fins. Sew it all the way around. This allows you to slip the costume bottom on, and the bottom of the tail will cling at the bottom, resembling Ariel’s tail."

You can stop at your calves rather than your heels if you want a costume that's a bit easier to move around in."

If you have a hard time finding one, you can definitely order one inexpensively on the internet. [11] X Research source It would be cute to add some little embellishments in the hair, like small barrettes with starfish on them. [12] X Research source You could also spray the hair lightly with the canned glitter made specifically for hair – it would be pretty and look like water droplets."
