You can try connecting with an Ethernet cable instead of wireless. If your TV connects to the internet that way but not wirelessly, you know something is wrong with the Wi-Fi card inside your TV. [1] X Research source The wires around the network card are delicate, so storing the TV on its side or pinching the corner can damage the wires and disable your TV's wireless capability.

      "content": "Some users found that changing to 2.4GHz helps. You can do this in your router's settings page online , or by using the app (if your ISP gives you one, like Spectrum users can use the MySpectrum app to edit their router and network). Edit your network settings and uncheck the box for \"Use different names and passwords for 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi.\" That way, your device can use either frequency it needs, depending on which one is stronger. Update your router's encryption method to WPA2-AES or WPA--AES if you can. The older WEP or WPA-TKIP/WPA2-TKIP encryption methods are known to fail and cause Wi-Fi issues on newer LG TVs.
