      "title": "Use the back of your hand.",
      "content": "Use the back of your hand. Practice with the back of your hand in the privacy of your own room or when you are alone so you don't look strange because you are essentially kissing yourself. To do this, you should open your mouth as wide as your index finger when you have it laying sideways over your mouth. Put your lips gently over the back of your hand. You can move your lips in a circular motion, or pretend like you are lightly sucking the juice out of a fruit, like a plum."

      "title": "Stand in front of the mirror and pretend like she is front of you.",
      "content": "Stand in front of the mirror and pretend like she is front of you. Practice parting your lips in a circular motion. You can also use your tongue, like you're gently pushing into the flesh of a soft fruit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your eyes.",
      "content": "Use your eyes. Gesture by looking into her eyes, looking at her lips, and then back at her eyes to show your readiness."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sit really close to her to show affection and establish intimacy.",
      "content": "Sit really close to her to show affection and establish intimacy. If she is nervous and you feel like the time is right to kiss her, catching her off-guard by kissing her might take the edge off and pleasantly surprise her â€” and you!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Work up to the kiss by flirting.",
      "content": "Work up to the kiss by flirting. Touch her hand gently when you're talking to her; compliment her eyes or hair; or stare longingly into her eyes. Never underestimate what a simple touch can do to set the mood for the perfect first kiss. Touching your girlfriend breaks the barrier that separates the two of you and paves the way to a more intimate connection, which is the kiss ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain eye contact until you kiss.",
      "content": "Maintain eye contact until you kiss. Fix the other person's gaze with your eyes and don't close your eyes until you've gone into the kiss. Locking onto her eyes is the best way to pull her in to grab that kiss."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read clear, non-verbal signs from your girl.",
      "content": "Read clear, non-verbal signs from your girl. A few signals that show her readiness can save you from making the wrong move: She stares at your lips a lot. She starts talking about kissing, or kiss-related topics. Is she talking about how she has never had a great kiss? is she revealing to you that she appreciates a great kisser? If so it's time to pucker up and grace her with your kiss. She pauses, as if expecting a kiss, especially at the end of the date. Be sure that there is no other reason for her apparent pausing and expectant state. If she is not appearing uncomfortable and appears to like the intimacy with you, then it is assumed that you can go in for a kiss."

    {
      "title": "Go ahead and ask.",
      "content": "Go ahead and ask. Since you've never been kissed, you may find it difficult to read your girl's non-verbal cues."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be creative and ask in a way that puts her at ease.",
      "content": "Be creative and ask in a way that puts her at ease. A few prompts would be: I really want to kiss you right now... I want to show you just how much you mean to me... Can I kiss you goodnight?"
