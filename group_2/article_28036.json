      "title": "Pour a dollop of thick shampoo into a little dish.",
      "content": "Pour a dollop of thick shampoo into a little dish. Any shampoo will work, but one with a thicker consistency works best. Put two squeezes, or about 2 tbsp (30 mL), of the shampoo into a dish you can stir the slime together in later. [1] X Research source Try adding 1 or 2 drops of food coloring to the shampoo if you want colored slime."

    {
      "title": "Add a small amount of toothpaste to the shampoo.",
      "content": "Add a small amount of toothpaste to the shampoo. Opaque toothpaste (white or mint colored) works best, but you can also try the striped kind. Use a quarter of the amount of toothpaste you did shampoo. About 1 tsp (5 mL) or so is enough. [2] X Research source Slime makers have the most success with brand toothpaste , but any brands should do the trick."

      "title": "Stir the shampoo and toothpaste together.",
      "content": "Stir the shampoo and toothpaste together. Use a craft stick , toothpick, or spoon. As you stir, the shampoo and toothpaste will come together to form a gooey substance. Keep stirring until it’s well combined, which should take about a minute. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add more shampoo or toothpaste, if needed, and continue stirring.",
      "content": "Add more shampoo or toothpaste, if needed, and continue stirring. If the slime is too hard, add some more shampoo. If the slime is too runny, add more toothpaste. Stir the slime well for another minute or so, or until it’s the same color and texture. [4] X Research source There’s no right or wrong way to make this slime. Make it to match your preferences!"

      "content": "Freeze the slime for 10 to 60 minutes. Chilling the slime is essentially the “activator” of this recipe as it binds the ingredients together to create a moldable consistency. Check the slime in 10-minute increments until it reaches your desired consistency. Take a close look at the slime in the freezer and make sure no ice particles are forming on top. If ice forms, move it to a different spot in the freezer or pop it in the fridge for around 6 hours. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the slime until it softens up. Take the slime out of the freezer. Roll, squish, and squeeze the slime between your fingers until it becomes soft and squishy again. The slime won’t turn runny like before but will be easily moldable. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Play with the slime until it dries out. This slime is very thick, almost like putty. You can squish, squeeze, and stretch it. When you're done playing with it, put it away into a small plastic container with a lid. The slime will eventually dry out, so throw it away and make a fresh batch when it becomes too hard to mold."

      "content": "Add a pinch of salt to the slime and stir. In this recipe, the salt is your activator, merging all the ingredients to create a shapeable goo. Use plain table salt, as chunky rock salt won't mix in very well. Stir for about a minute or until the shampoo, toothpaste, and salt are well combined. [10] X Research source The slime will thicken and become dough-like as you stir. If your slime isn’t the right consistency, add more ingredients as you stir. More shampoo will make it slimier, and more toothpaste will make it doughier."

When you don't want to play with it anymore, put it into a plastic container with a lid. The slime will eventually lose its elasticity, even when stored away. If this happens, no worries! Simply toss out the old slime and make a new batch. [11] X Research source"

This type of shampoo is thicker and slimier than others, making it a perfect base for gooier slimes. 1 to 2 squeezes of shampoo (or roughly 2 tbsp (30 mL) should be enough to get you started. [12] X Research source Slime makers tend to use Sauve Kids for this slime recipe, but any 2-in-1 shampoo should work well. Consider picking a scented shampoo to make your slime smell amazing."
