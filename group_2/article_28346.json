      "title": "Start with a clean canvas.",
      "content": "Start with a clean canvas. For best results, begin your makeup routine with a quick cleanse. Wipe off any old makeup and mascara so that your lashes are fresh. Applying new mascara is easier because your lashes will flake and look clumpy rather than long and sleek if you layer the new over old. Cleaning your face every night before bed is a good habit to have. Using a makeup remover before washing your face with a cleanser makes it easier to clean your face because it breaks down the makeup, including mascara. If you're using mascara that's labeled waterproof or long-lasting, it's especially important that you use makeup remover."

      "content": "Warm up your mascara tube. Dip your closed mascara tube in a cup of warm water from the tap. Let it sit for a few minutes while you apply your foundational makeup and do your hair. The warmth turns your mascara from a goopy substance to a liquid that spreads much easier over your lashes. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Be gentle with the bristles of the wand when taking it out to use. You don’t want to damage them in order to extend the wand’s length and quality. Twist the wand around inside the tube instead of pumping it up and down. As you pull your wand from the tube, gently spin the bristles around the edge of the tube’s opening. This will clear off excess mascara and keep your lashes from being weighed down."

    {
      "title": "Swipe both sides of your lashes.",
      "content": "Swipe both sides of your lashes. Covering both the top and bottom of your lashes will help to define them. First bring your wand down over the top of your lashes as you look toward the ground. Then swipe up to get the underside of your lashes. Clean off any accidental smears of mascara on your eyelids or cheeks with a cotton swab or tissue. Opening your mouth slightly will help widen your eyes and make it easier to apply mascara."

      "title": "Drag your wand from the roots to the tips of your lashes.",
      "content": "Drag your wand from the roots to the tips of your lashes. Putting too much mascara on the tips of your lashes will weigh them down and cause any length to flatten out during the day. Place the wand at the roots of your lashes and slightly wiggle it side to side and then up to the tips. This motion deposits mascara at the base and allow the tips to curl without being burdened.

      "title": "Angle your wand vertically to extend your lashes.",
      "content": "Angle your wand vertically to extend your lashes. Normally you would apply mascara by holding the wand horizontally with the bristles pointing up and down. For longer lashes, hold the wand up and down and paint a couple of lashes at a time with the bristles going sideways. Horizontal brushing makes lashes look fuller and vertical brushing makes them look natural and long. It’s easier to do your top lashes by holding your hand above your head and pulling the wand up over your lashes. Place a tissue under your bottom lashes when drawing the wand down over them to keep your face from getting smudged."

      "title": "Experiment with different colors of mascara.",
      "content": "Experiment with different colors of mascara. Pops of color or neutral combinations can help make your lashes look longer. “Minking” is a practical method of extending your lashes. First use a coat of black mascara, then brush dark brown along the tips, and finish up by reapplying black. This adds dimension without being obvious. [3] X Research source You may not want to use colored mascara for every-day wear, but it’s certainly a fun alternative for a night out. Try using a neutral color like black or brown and then tipping your lashes with a bright hue or gold and silver just to play around with how dual tones extend your lashes. For lighter hair colors and natural coppery reds, use brown mascara. For any other hair color, use black. Complimenting your natural coloring will look more natural."

      "content": "Use an eyelash curler. Curling lashes always helps them look longer. [4] X Expert Source Cassandra McClure Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 7 March 2019. Crimp as close as possible to your roots as possible without grabbing skin. Hold for eight seconds and then move halfway up your lashes and then to your tips while pressing each section for another eight seconds. This prevents your lashes from having a rigid 90 degree angle appearance. [5] X Research source Rotate the curler to increase the intensity. Start by holding the curler with your hand below your eye, and as you move up the lashes, bring your hand gradually above your head to help guide the curler and lashes upwards. [6] X Research source Warm the curler with a hair dryer beforehand. This will help your lashes conform to the curler better and set them, almost like a curling iron.

      "content": "Comb your lashes with an eyelash comb. A double-sided eyelash brush has one side of thick bristles and the other side has a few thin plastic teeth.The plastic teeth help to eliminate clumps of mascara and separate lashes to make them look thinner, slender, and long. An unused, clean toothbrush is an option instead of a specialized comb."

      "content": "Curl your lashes with a regular spoon . Take a regular table spoon and hold the edge of the spoon to your roots with the concave side facing out. Use your thumb to press your lashes up around the edge of the spoon. Move your thumb upwards on your lashes like you would a wand to smooth them out to look longer. [9] X Research source You can use this method anywhere and anytime during the day for a quick lash pick-me-up. Spoons have dual mascara purposes. Place the convex side of the spoon underneath your bottom lashes. This way you can brush each lash the whole way, subsequently making them look longer and protecting your cheek from smudges."

      "content": "Try fake lashes on for a temporary fix. If you have a special event or performance that you need a quick and easy boost of lash length, grab a pair of fake ones. Follow the instructions on the package since directions can vary per brand. Apply the glue onto the fake lashes with a cotton swab or bobby pin or directly onto your eyelid to make application easier. [10] X Research source This isn’t a cheap method if you use fake lashes every day, but they’re a quick alternative once in awhile if you're budgeting. Blend the seam of the fake lashes into your natural lash line with a similarly colored eyeliner. [11] X Research source Put a mirror on a counter and look down into it rather than straight into a mirror. This will give you a better vantage point. Prop your elbows and arms up on a counter of sink to stabilize yourself when applying fake lashes so that you can be precise."

      "content": "Coat your lashes with baby powder in between applications of mascara. Apply one coat of mascara and let it dry. Then, dip a cotton swab and dust the tops and bottoms of your lashes. Put one more coat of mascara over top of the baby powder to return it to black and nearly double the length of your lashes. [12] X Research source You should have enough baby powder on that your lashes look ashy and gray. Clean your wand in between dipping it in baby powder and mascara to avoid clumping. Have an extra mascara wand on hand for the baby powder so you don’t contaminate your tube. You can clean off an old wand and reuse it."

Apply either almond oil, extra virgin olive oil, coconut, or jojoba oil to your eyes at night before you go to bed. These are natural moisturizers that will heal any damaged lashes but will also help them to grow. [13] X Research source Dabbing coconut oil on to your lashes will darken them and is a perfect time-saver in the morning if you run out of time for your normal makeup routine. Petroleum jelly is a classic beauty shortcut that can also help your lashes. Apply it at night just as you would the other oils. You can also use an old wand to paint the oils onto your lashes if you want to be precise."
