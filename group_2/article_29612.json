Select a free version and sign up or download it so you can use it to create your photo collage without having to purchase a full program. [1] X Research source Popular free digital collage making apps and programs include Canva, Adobe Spark, BeFunky, and PhotoCollage. They allow you to upload your own photos, but they may not have as many embellishments or styles to choose from as a premium collage-making program. Other great free options include Layout from Instagram and Google Photos, both of which allow you to choose photos that you’ve uploaded and put them together into a simple collage format. Some premium programs like Adobe Photoshop allow you to download a free trial version so you can use a more professional program that has more features than free ones to make a collage without paying the full price for it. Use a word processor for an easy-to-use option that you may already have on your computer to make a quick photo collage."

For example, Adobe Photoshop costs around $600 USD. Many free programs, such as Canva, BeFunky, and piZap offer premium versions you can buy to access additional features, without having to pay to the full cost of a professional design program."
