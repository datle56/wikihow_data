      "title": "The head line of your palm reveals your intellect and mentality.",
      "content": "The head line of your palm reveals your intellect and mentality. Also known as the wisdom line, the head line is one of the 3 most important lines in palm reading, alongside the heart line and the life line. In addition to revealing your intellect, it also displays your creativity, beliefs and attitudes, memory, and self-control. To locate your head line, first look between your thumb and forefinger. The head line starts at the edge of your palm and extends across the middle of it. The heart line is located above it and the life line below. While the head line reveals how you use your brain, it does not provide any indication of how intelligent you are. Don’t let a line on your hand cause you to think you’re dumb!"

The non-dominant hand reveals innate characteristics like personality and natural talents and abilities, as well as destiny and past experiences. Most palm readers recommend reading both to fully understand your situation. In ancient Chinese traditions, the right palm represented women while the left represented men."

The location of the island also determines its meaning, and you’ll find some common locations below: [7] X Research source If you have an island below the Mound of Jupiter, you might have trouble concentrating on tasks. If you have an island below the Mound of Saturn (the fleshy section below the middle finger), you may be prone to headaches and depression, or you might have frequent stomach trouble. An island below the Mound of Apollo (the fleshy section below the ring finger) indicates you might have poor eyesight. An island below the little finger indicates you may have a nervous breakdown or suffer from cerebropathy later in life. The presence of 2 islands often reflects stubbornness, self-centeredness, and a lack of common sense. Again, palmistry is not rooted in science, so don’t stress too much if you have one or more of these markings. Always consult your doctor if you’re truly worried about your health."
