      "content": "Have an honest conversation about your feelings the next morning. To keep your friendship alive, take a minute to talk about where you’re at emotionally. You can do this in person if you woke up together, or send a text if you went home on your own. Make sure to follow up right away so that there are no lingering awkward feelings. [1] X Research source Say something like, “That was a lot of fun! But I really value your friendship, so let’s not do that again. I don’t want to complicate things.” Or, if you’d like to keep up a physical relationship , let them know what you’re thinking: “I had a great time last night! Maybe this could happen again? If you’re up for it, let’s talk about it more. If not, no sweat.”"

      "content": "Ask your friend to hang out to avoid awkwardness. You might be feeling a little awkward after hooking up with a friend, but don't worry. That's normal, and your friend probably feels a little weird, too. Don't try to make things too intense by having a long, deep conversation. Instead, check in with your friend to make sure you're on the same page. Then, ask them if they want to hang out. Keep your tone light, and suggest a platonic activity. [2] X Research source You can do this a day or two after the hook-up to get rid of any lingering awkward feelings. Say something like, \"I just wanted to make sure we're cool about what happened the other night. I definitely want to still hang out as friends. Are you up for grabbing coffee later?\""

      "content": "Take the friendship slowly. The fact is, being friends with someone you've slept with is probably going to be a little weird for a while, but that's not a bad thing. It just... is . It'll likely take time before you two start to feel comfortable talking about who you're dating now or relying on one another for emotional support. Communicate any boundaries you'd like your friend to respect while you navigate the complexity of a post-hookup friendship, and respect any boundaries or expectations of theirs. [3] X Research source Maybe your \"rules\" for the friendship include not talking about your other hookups in front of each other, or maybe you're perfectly at ease doing that, but don't feel comfortable being alone with your friend. The rules aren't set in stone. Don't be afraid to revise your rules as you go. For instance, you might think you're cool hearing about your friend's new partner until they actually broach the subject. When you're just starting to hang out again after sleeping together, group hangs are the way to go: there's way less pressure, and it's a great way for you both to test the waters before diving in."

      "content": "Be upfront about new partners. While you might not want to get too in-depth about your sex life with the friend you've hooked up with, don't hide new relationships, either. Whether you casually slip your new partner's name into conversation or invite them along to your next group hang, be up front and direct about their presence in your life without making a big deal out of it. The same holds for how to tell your new partner you've slept with your friend: no need to get into the details or to share on the first date, but it's best not to withhold the info in the interest of transparency. [4] X Research source If and when your friend starts dating someone new, try not to be jealous or possessive. Remember, you're friends, not lovers. That said, don't be afraid to take some space from your friend for a while if you find it difficult to accept they're seeing someone else."

[5] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. It doesn’t have to be an intense, lengthy conversation, but being open from the beginning will help keep the friendship healthy. [6] X Research source You could say, “I’m not looking for a commitment or relationship.

[7] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Try suggesting that you don’t spend the night together if that seems too intimate for you. You could also request that they don’t hook up with anyone else while you two are hooking up. This isn't a rule for everyone, but you and your friend with benefits must come to an agreement and follow it to the letter. Communication is key in every relationship.

Listen to your friend when they voice their needs, feelings, and boundaries. Take care not to gossip about your friend or your relationship. It’s nobody else’s business! [9] X Research source It’s also respectful to respond to texts or calls in a timely manner. Basically, don’t treat your friend any differently than you did in the past."

Above all else, hooking up is supposed to be fun for both of you. Check in occasionally about your feelings, but keep things light-hearted by enjoying your physical connection. [10] X Research source Don’t feel pressure to set up date nights or anything like that. This isn’t a traditional relationship, so you can be a lot more casual."

If you need to talk to someone, try taking it to a family member or another friend. If you depend on your hook-up friend for everything, you risk making this a more serious relationship.

It's likely that you'll stop hooking up at some point, but if you work at it, there's no reason you can't continue being friends. Keep doing things as friends that don't involve getting physical so that you remember the true foundation of your relationship.

The important part is that you let them know what you need and want.

While you might want to avoid getting into the deets of your newest sexcapades with your friend right after you've stopped hooking up, there's no need to shy away from letting them know you're seeing anyone new. Be upfront about new partners, whether by informing your friend directly or by just casually inviting them to group hangouts. You might say, \"Hey, Lane, I just wanted to let you know I've started seeing someone else.\" Letting them know directly may help them prepare to see you with someone else, but showing up to your mutual friend's house party with a date is also a low-key way to show your friend you've moved on. It might be tempting to keep new relationships secret, but realize that your friend could still hear about it via the rumor mill. They might feel better hearing it from you directly."

After hooking up with a friend, it's not uncommon to feel the pangs of jealousy or lust for a little while, even if you know you aren't actually interested in this friend. That said, try to avoid feeling insecure or jealous when your friend inevitably starts seeing someone new. It may hurt at first, but the feeling will fade in time. If it's hard to accept that your friend has gotten involved with someone new, consider taking a step back from the friendship for a little while. The feelings will likely get easier to manage over time. [14] X Research source"

Allow yourself some time to process your emotions and get into a new routine. There’s no set amount of time that works for everyone, but plan to stay away from each other for at least a few weeks. [15] X Research source While you’re taking time apart, limit all communications. That means no texting in addition to not hanging out. Mute the other person on social media.

[17] X Research source You could make a rule that you won’t contact each other after 9 p.m., or that you only meet for lunch once a month. Maybe there are certain topics of conversation you’ll avoid around your ex, such as your sex lives or love lives. That said, be sure to be upfront about new partners, and to (eventually) tell new partners about your ex's presence in your life. There are no firm and hard rules for how to behave around an ex.

Your ex may eventually bring a new partner around, and it's bound to make you a bit uneasy, especially if you only recently ended your relationship with your ex. Go easy on yourself for experiencing complicated feelings or even outright jealousy, but try not to give into those feelings or put them on your ex to deal with. It might hurt, but your ex is allowed to move on (and so are you). [19] X Research source You might need to take some space away from your ex for a bit to adjust to the idea of them seeing someone new. Remember that insecurity, possessiveness, or even longing when your ex starts seeing someone else are pretty common feelings, and they don't necessarily indicate that you're still interested in your ex. They'll likely go away with time."
