[1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Most products require you to spray both sides of the lens, let dry, and wipe clean with a soft, dry cloth. Some products suggest longer dry times, while others require the spray or gel be rinsed off prior to wiping. Check product packaging for specific instructions."

      "content": "Pull your glasses away from your face. Your glasses trap heat and moisture when too close to your face or eyes, which increases the incidence of fog build up. Try moving your glasses further down your nose to allow for more air circulation and less fog. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Check to make sure your clothing isn't obstructing the air flow.",
      "content": "Check to make sure your clothing isn't obstructing the air flow. Items like scarves and high-collared coats can trap moisture and push it upwards, leading to fogging. Also, wearing lots of layers can increase your body temperature and perspiration, which may also contribute to your glasses fogging up. If you canâ€™t avoid wearing this type of clothing, try unzipping your coat or letting your scarf hang open to allow for more air flow. Alternatively, try tucking the clothing under your chin so your breath can flow outward instead of up. If your glasses fog up because you're wearing a mask, tape the top of the mask to the bridge of your nose.

      "content": "Avoid storing your glasses in the cold weather. Putting cold glasses on a warm body makes for an even bigger fog effect with temperature change. Instead, keep your glasses inside the house (instead of your car) to help reduce fogging when you move from warm to cold spaces."
