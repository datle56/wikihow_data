      "title": "Look at the tail.",
      "content": "Look at the tail. Manx cats have four different tail varieties. “Rumpies” have no tail at all, and instead sport a dimple at the base of the spine where the tail would normally extend. “Rumpy-risers” have a stubby tail of only one to three bones. “Stumpies” have a short tail that is curved or kinked. And finally, “longies” have tails that are almost as long as those of regular cats. Most breeders cut the tails off of longies, so unless you’re a breeder, you probably won’t encounter a longie."

      "title": "Look at the build.",
      "content": "Look at the build. Manx cats are muscular and compact, with a sturdy skeleton. They are medium to large in size with a wide chest. Their hind legs are noticeably longer than their front legs, giving them an appearance some have likened to rabbits. [1] X Research source Males might be somewhat larger than females."

      "title": "Check the head for a cradle-like shape.",
      "content": "Check the head for a cradle-like shape. When viewed from behind, the ears appear as a cradle or rocker shape. The ears are broad-based and taper to a rounded tip. [2] X Research source Manx cats have broad faces."

      "title": "Touch the cat.",
      "content": "Touch the cat. There are two varieties of Manx coats. Short-haired Manxes have a long overcoat with a dense, fluffy undercoat. The hair of the overcoat might feel coarse even though it looks fluffy. If you pet the cat during summer or late spring, the fur might feel thin due to spring shedding. The long-haired Manx has a silky coat of medium length, and tufts of fur between its toes and around its ears. [3] X Research source White Manxes might have a softer coat than Manxes of other colors."

    {
      "title": "Look for large eyes.",
      "content": "Look for large eyes. Manxes have large, round eyes. The outer corners of the eyes will point up slightly toward the ears, while the lower corners will angle down and inward slightly toward the nose. [4] X Research source Eye color in Manxes varies. Green, hazel, gold, copper, and blue are all common. Some Manxes are odd-eyed (that is, each eye has a different color)."

      "title": "Weigh your cat.",
      "content": "Weigh your cat. Male Manxes weigh around 10-12 pounds (4.5-5.4 kg). Females weigh about 8-10 pounds (3.6-4.5 kg). Weigh your cat on a scale to determine if it falls within or near breed averages. [5] X Research source Manxes feel surprisingly heavy when lifted."

      "title": "Use color to identify the cat.",
      "content": "Use color to identify the cat. Manxes come in a wide variety of colors, so using color to identify one can be difficult. Common colors include tabby, calico (multicolor), and tortoiseshell. You can eliminate certain colors, though, since Manxes do not come in chocolate, lavender, or pointed (light coloring on the body and dark coloring on the limbs, tail, and face) varieties. They also do not come in any of these colors plus white. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for a friendly demeanor.",
      "content": "Look for a friendly demeanor. Manxes are playful and friendly creatures. They are affectionate and love hopping in people’s laps. They get along well with children and other pets. If that sounds like your cat, you might have a Manx."

    {
      "title": "Look for a playful cat.",
      "content": "Look for a playful cat. Manxes enjoy jumping on shelves and other elevated perches. They have dog-like characteristics that include chasing after balled-up pieces of paper or ping-pong balls. They also enjoy swatting at running water. If your cat comes running when you turn the tap, you might just have a Manx. If you do have a Manx, you can provide it with a cat tree or cat house so it can have many opportunities to jump and play."

      "title": "Listen to the cat.",
      "content": "Listen to the cat. Manx cats do not vocalize often, but they do have a distinctive vocalization. In addition to normal feline purrs and meows, they also produce a trilling sound. This sound is most commonly heard from mother cats callings their kittens. Manxes have soft voices. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Monitor the cat’s health.",
      "content": "Monitor the cat’s health. Manxes have generally good health, but are predisposed to a condition called Manx syndrome. The condition has a number of symptoms that might not be immediately obvious as part of an underlying condition. Symptoms can include bowel and bladder issues, poor digestion, deformity of the spine, and partial paralysis. Manx syndrome is usually a lifelong condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort for Manx cats. [8] X Research source If you observe these symptoms in your cat, contact your vet for a diagnosis."

      "title": "Get a genetic test.",
      "content": "Get a genetic test. If you cannot determine whether or not you’ve got a Manx on your hands using behavioral and visual data, you could take your cat to the vet for a DNA test. To perform a DNA test, your vet or a qualified medical technician will perform a noninvasive procedure to obtain a sample of your cat’s DNA, typically by swabbing the inside of its cheek or clipping some of its fur. The cat’s genome will then be matched against that of a known Manx cat and evaluated for similarities. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a reputable breeder. By obtaining your cat through a reputable breeder, you’ll be able to get official certification from the breeder that confirms whether your cat is a Manx. To identify reputable breeders, consult your vet or a feline enthusiast association such as the International Cat Association. [10] X Research source"
