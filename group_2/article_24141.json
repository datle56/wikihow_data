      "content": "Decide which part of the wiper you need to replace. The wiper assembly consists of two parts: the arm and a wiper blade that attaches to the metal arm. The rubber insert that rests against the glass of the windshield is for the most part is not available separately. If the wiper blade isn’t resting against the glass with enough tension or has become bent, you’ll need to replace the entire blade."

Ask a salesperson to help you select the right wipers, or, alternatively, measure each of the old wipers first and bring the measurements with you into the store.

      "content": "Pull the entire wiper assembly arm away from the windshield and into a standing position. Move the wiper into a position perpendicular to the metal arm. Repeat with the other wiper arm. Some wipers will only come two to three inches away from the windshield; if that’s the case, don’t try to force the wipers up any further. On some cars it may be easier to turn on the wipers and when they start to move turn off the ignition. This will allow you to move the arm up to have better access to remove the wiper blade."

      "title": "Release the wiper blade.",
      "content": "Release the wiper blade. Locate the small tab on the underside of wiper blade (near where the rubber insert meets the metal arm), then push it in (or in some cases, pull on it) to release. Pull down on the blade and it should then slide off the hook of the metal arm. [3] X Research source You may need to tap or tug on the blade a bit to remove it if there’s built up debris or corrosion. Sometimes it helps to push the wiper up into the holder, press the tab, and then remove. The bare metal arms are now exposed, and, if left in the standing position, they can snap back and damage your windshield. So, to be safe, gently place the metal arms back against the windshield until you’re ready to put on the new ones. To be extra safe, place a rag or cloth underneath the metal arm while it rests on the windshield."

The rule of thumb is that the blade is 90 degrees to the glass mid-swipe The reason for mid-swipe is it will change angle from the top of the windshield to the bottom of the windshield due to the curvature of the glass."

If the wipers are still streaky, check that the blades are properly installed. Verify that you’ve installed each blade on the correct side and check that the wiper is properly oriented.
