      "content": "Try other methods of soothing reflux first. While Gaviscon may help with reflux, it can also make fussy eaters fussier. Typically, a doctor only recommends this product if your baby is having pain or distress from reflux. Some studies even question how helpful Gaviscon is for babies. It may provide some relief, but some studies show it is only marginally better than a placebo.

      "content": "Talk to your doctor before using Gaviscon. Your doctor can help you determine whether your baby's heartburn is bad enough to consider using Gaviscon. Also, they can help you decide on an appropriate dose for your baby. Discuss the symptoms you've been noticing in your baby with your doctor. For instance, tell the doctor if your baby appears to be in distress after eating or is having trouble eating."

      "title": "Do not add Gaviscon to a formula with a thickener.",
      "content": "Do not add Gaviscon to a formula with a thickener. Because Gaviscon Infant acts as a thickener, you shouldn't combine it with formulas that are already designed to be thick. You should mix these formulas as directed on the bottle. If you want to use Gaviscon in place of a thick formula, try adding Gaviscon to a formula of normal thickness."

      "content": "Use 1 packet of Gaviscon Infant for a baby under 10 pounds (4.5 kg). For a smaller baby, use a single packet as 1 dose. A single packet has 225 milligrams of sodium alginate and 87.5 milligrams of magnesium alginate. [3] X Research source Make sure you are using the infant version of this medication for proper dosing. Do not use adult versions without checking with your doctor. They are more difficult to measure for babies. Always talk to your pediatrician first about dosing."

Add in another 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of water, and mix it until smooth. Boiling the tap water is important because it removes any bacteria that may be in the water."

For a baby under 10 pounds (4.5 kg), use at least 0.5 cups (120 mL) of formula. If your baby is over that weight, mix it into at least 1 cup (240 mL) of formula. Shake the mixture thoroughly after mixing the powders and water in the bottle."

      "content": "Make a bigger hole in a bottle teat or choose one with a faster flow. Gaviscon Infant may make it more difficult for the milk to flow through the teat of the bottle. You can use a sterile needle to make the hole bigger or purchase a teat with a larger hole to begin with. Loosening the cap on the bottle may also help. To sterilize a needle , try boiling it for 10 minutes. [5] X Research source"

In that case, switching to another formula may help reduce your baby's distress.

      "content": "Feed your baby more often. Feeding more often means your baby gets a smaller amount at a time. Reflux in babies often happens because they have too much milk in their bellies, so having smaller, more frequent meals can help.

      "title": "Position your baby in a more upright position when feeding.",
      "content": "Position your baby in a more upright position when feeding. When your baby is upright, gravity is working in their favor. That is, milk has less of a chance of coming back up. Keep your baby in this position directly after eating, too. Hold your baby in a position where they're sitting up and cradled in your chest. Keep them in this position for 30 minutes after eating. You can also try the curved position. Support their back with one arm and wrap it around their legs, so their calves drape over your arm. You are cradling them in a \"C\" position, and their upper body should be mostly upright with their head slightly elevated."

      "title": "Burp your baby while feeding and directly after.",
      "content": "Burp your baby while feeding and directly after. Burping your baby helps them get rid of air in their stomach. With the air gone, there's more room for milk, meaning there's less of a chance of them spitting it back up. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The typical way to burp a baby is to hold them with their head facing your shoulder. Make sure to have a cloth to catch spit up, and gently rub or pat the baby's back."

      "content": "Keep the baby from moving around too much after feeding. In other words, don't bounce them up and down or move them around too much. Bouncing the baby around may worsen the effects of reflux. Burping, of course, is fine, just don't bounce the baby up and down on your knee or anything like that for about 30 minutes."
