      "content": "Lay several wontons out on a surface. To make things easier, you should only work with a few wontons at a time, but you should continue filling the wrappers until all of the filling is gone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wet the edges of the wonton wrapper.",
      "content": "Wet the edges of the wonton wrapper. In order for the wrapper to stick together, they need to be slightly moist. Do not soak the entire wrapper, though. Instead, just wet the tip of your finger with a little water and gently rub your wet finger along the edges of the wrapper."

      "title": "Spoon a little of the mixture onto each wrapper.",
      "content": "Spoon a little of the mixture onto each wrapper. Put anywhere from 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 to 15 ml) of filling onto each wrapper, depending on how large the wonton wrappers are. The wrappers should be well filled, but you should also have enough empty wrapper to fold and seal it up."

      "title": "Fold the wonton wrapper in half.",
      "content": "Fold the wonton wrapper in half. Fold one corner over the middle of the wrapper until it meets the corner diagonally opposite from it. Press the corners together."

      "title": "Bring the other two opposite corners together.",
      "content": "Bring the other two opposite corners together. Fold the two corners at the base of the triangle together, over the filling, and seal them together. You may need to wet the corners again to accomplish this. The end result should be what appears to be a little pocket or \"boat\" of filling."

      "title": "Bring to adjacent corners together.",
      "content": "Bring to adjacent corners together. Fold two corners that are next to each other up so that they meet in the center of the wrapper, which should also be the center of the filling blob. Press the corners to seal together, and press along the edges that have met together."

      "title": "Fold a third corner up to the same point.",

      "title": "Bring two adjacent sides together over the filling.",
      "content": "Bring two adjacent sides together over the filling. Working from the middle of each side rather than the corner, bring two sides that are next to each other up and over the center of the wrapper and the center of the filling. Press the middle of both sides together."

      "title": "Fold the remaining two sides to the same point.",
      "content": "Fold the remaining two sides to the same point. Again working from the middle of each edge, bring the sides up and over the filling to the center point of the wrapper, where the other two sides have already been sealed. Press the center of each edge into this point, sealing all four sides together. You should be left with a shape that looks like an \"X\" with slightly open corners."

      "content": "Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot. [1] X Research source A deep fryer works well, but a stockpot, large wok, or Dutch oven works equally well. You should fill the pot with at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of oil. Heat the oil over medium to medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature between 350 and 375 degrees Fahrenheit (177 and 191 degrees Celsius). You can check the temperature of the oil by using a candy thermometer. If you use a thermometer that can be attached to the side of the pot, you can monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the entire cooking process."

If you are not used to deep frying foods, you may even want to start out with three or four at once. You need to make sure that you leave plenty of room to prevent the rangoon from sticking together or frying incompletely. You also need plenty of room to be able to fish them out of the oil."
