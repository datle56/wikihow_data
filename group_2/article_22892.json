      "content": "The 🥵 (hot face) emoji means someone’s feeling hot or overheated. This versatile emoji pops up when someone’s been out in the sun too long, has a fever, or ate something a little too spicy for them. This is the most common use of the emoji and you can assume the sender is just hot unless they say something else to indicate they’re stressed or flirting. If someone sends you 🥵 (hot face), they’re really feeling the heat! [1] X Research source “I can’t believe my AC broke on the day it’s gonna be 100 degrees! 🥵” “FYI, Jess wasn’t lying when she said her homemade salsa was extra hot 🥵🌶️”"

Imagine the flushed, hot feeling you get when your to-do list is 1,000 miles long and you don’t know where to start, then picture that feeling as an emoji. It probably looks something like 🥵! Most often, the emoji will be accompanied by a description of the stressed person’s to-do list or woes. [2] X Research source “If I finish my history paper, cram for my math test, and make it home from track practice by 7pm, then I'll have time to start my chem project…🥵” “I have a hundred people asking for help all at once 🥵 I don’t know how to handle it!”"

The emoji might show up all by itself or accompanied by a (hopefully respectful) compliment when someone’s feeling flirtatious over text or on social media. Look out for a cheeky “hey,” a compliment on your look, or especially a comment on a flattering photo of you on social media. [3] X Research source “You look great! 🥵” “🥵🥵🥵”"
