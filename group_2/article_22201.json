      "title": "Narrow down your conversation to one specific issue.",
      "content": "Narrow down your conversation to one specific issue. Try to make it really specific, too—the clearer the issue is, the better you and your partner will be able to address it. If you have more than one thing you want to talk about, save the others for a later date. It’s much easier to talk about one thing at a time so you and your partner don’t get overwhelmed. [1] X Research source For instance, if you feel like you and your partner aren’t spending enough time together, you might talk about how you can rearrange your schedules to see each other more often. If you feel like your partner isn’t treating you well, you could talk about how you want to go on dates more often."

    {
      "title": "Beginning on the right foot can help the conversation go smoothly.",
      "content": "Beginning on the right foot can help the conversation go smoothly. Thank your partner for sitting down to chat with you, and let them know that you’re here to find a solution together (not start a fight). If your partner knows where you’re coming from, they’re less likely to get defensive. [2] X Research source Try something like, “Thanks for talking with me about this. I’ve been thinking about it for a little while now, and I know I’ll feel better if I just get this out in the open.”"

    {
      "title": "Your voice says a lot about what you’re feeling.",
      "content": "Your voice says a lot about what you’re feeling. During a deep relationship talk, you might feel a little bit hurt or upset. Do your best to keep your tone of voice calm and collected, and avoid raising your voice at your partner. If you can stay neutral the whole time, you’ll have a much more productive conversation. [3] X Research source Try to take stock of your body language, too. Crossing your arms or turning away from your partner can indicate that you’re mad or upset, but facing your partner and keeping your arms by your side is more neutral."

      "title": "Avoid blaming your partner by focusing on yourself.",
      "content": "Avoid blaming your partner by focusing on yourself. You can phrase things by using “I” statements (instead of “you” statements) to make your partner feel less defensive. [4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Try bringing up the issue at hand using an “I” statement, like: [5] X Research source “Since we haven’t defined our relationship, I am a little confused.” “We have different goals in life, and I’m worried about that.” “We haven’t discussed our finances yet, and I would feel better if we did.”"

      "content": "Your emotions can help your partner understand where you’re coming from. It’s easy to brush someone off if you bring something up without talking about how it makes them feel. Really highlight the fact that the problem is making you feel upset, hurt, or angry, so that your partner feels more motivated to work on it with you. [6] X Research source You might say something like, “When you don’t introduce me as your girlfriend to people, it makes me feel really sad and hurt.” Or, “I’m not sure where this relationship is going, and that makes me feel frustrated.” Your partner will be more receptive if they're not feeling defensive.

      "content": "Get your partner to talk by choosing questions they can’t answer with yes or no. If your partner isn’t really one for talking, you may have some trouble getting them to open up. Try asking them questions that they can respond to so they’re contributing to the conversation. Try ones like: [8] X Research source “How do you feel about that?” “What’s your take on this?” “Can you tell me your point of view?”"

      "title": "Let your partner talk uninterrupted, and avoid any distractions.",
      "content": "Let your partner talk uninterrupted, and avoid any distractions. After you’ve talked, give your partner a chance to speak their mind, and put away any distractions. Make eye contact and nod along to show that you’re listening, and ask follow-up questions if you’re having trouble understanding what they mean. [9] X Research source You might ask questions like, “Could you tell me more?” or, “Can you explain that to me one more time?” You can also rephrase what your partner says in your own words to double check that you understand them."

      "content": "It’s you and your partner vs. the problem, not you vs. your partner. Once you’ve figured out what the issue is and where you’re both coming from, you can work together to find a solution. You might have to try out a few things before you find something that works, but if you tackle things as a team, it will be much easier. [10] X Research source If you’re having trouble coming up with ideas, ask your partner questions like, “Do you have any ideas on what we could do now?” or, “How do you think we can avoid this problem in the future?”"

      "content": "You might not both be 100% happy, and that’s okay. Find a solution that you can both live with so you come away from the conversation feeling good. Relationships are all about compromise, and you’ll probably have to do it a lot throughout your time together. [11] X Research source For instance, if you want more time with your boyfriend but he needs his alone time, you could plan to meet up every other day instead of every day. If you want to start saving money together but he doesn’t want to worry about budgeting right now, set a goal to both save a small amount of money every month instead of a big chunk."

      "content": "Implement what you talked about, then come together to see if it worked. Your solutions might not be perfect all the time, and if that’s the case, it’s okay to come back to the drawing board again. If you’ve tried out your compromise and it’s just not working for you (or your partner), have another talk to see what you might change to make things better. [12] X Research source Maybe you made a plan to make more time for sex, but with work stress and responsibilities, it just isn’t happening. You may need to schedule specific days and times to have sex so it doesn’t fall by the wayside. Or, maybe you made a plan to save money for the future, but your savings aren’t growing fast enough. You can talk about a new savings goal to speed up the process."
