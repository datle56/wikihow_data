      "content": "Rest is the most important thing you can do to speed up your recovery. When your voice is gone, either due to laryngitis, overuse, or other causes, it’s because your vocal cords are inflamed. Talking or singing will irritate your inflamed vocal cords, delaying your overall recovery. Try not to use your voice at all for at least a day, or speak softly when you must. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To communicate, try texting and writing your words down on a whiteboard or notebook instead. If talking is unavoidable, do so only for short periods, and use a microphone or megaphone if you need to be loud. Get plenty of regular rest as well! Your body heals fastest when it gets 7 to 9 hours of sleep nightly."

      "content": "Whispering actually puts more strain on your voice than talking normally. Even if you have to talk while waiting for your voice to recover fully, don’t whisper; doing so will pull your vocal cords tight and irritate them more than they already are. Speak with your natural voice at a low volume rather than resorting to a whisper to ensure fast healing. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Water keeps you hydrated and moisturizes your airways. Keep your body well-hydrated by drinking water to restore your voice. Increasing fluid intake helps your throat produce a healthy amount of moisture, which in turn helps make your voice functional. In short, moisture is key to getting your voice back! Drink around 64 fluid ounces (1.9 L) each day, equivalent to 8 cups of water. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Avoid drinks containing alcohol and caffeine while your vocal cords heal. Alcohol and caffeine (including drinks like coffee and black tea) dehydrate you, making your voice worse. Caffeine and alcohol can also induce acid reflux, which can cause or prolong laryngitis."

      "content": "Warm liquids can soothe your throat and thin out any mucus there. Drinking decaffeinated herbal tea (and other warm liquids) will help hydrate you, while the heat and steam will reduce irritation in your throat. Plus, they’ll thin out the mucus in your throat, which makes it easier to use your voice. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Most of the liquid you drink should be warm if possible, but ensure it’s not so hot that it scalds your throat. While it’s true that citrus drinks (including lemon tea) might not be the best for your throat, soothing teas like chamomile, licorice root, and ginger can help reduce inflammation."

      "content": "Honey acts like a cough suppressant to reduce irritation in your throat. Some evidence also suggests that it reduces mucus secretion and has antibacterial capabilities, which can help if you lose your voice due to a bacterial infection. Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of honey to each cup of tea you drink and stir it before drinking to enjoy a warm beverage with healing properties!

      "content": "Ginger and garlic can both help relieve your respiratory symptoms. Eating ginger will help suppress your cough, and consuming garlic helps to prevent respiratory infections. Luckily, there are many ways to incorporate ginger and garlic into your diet. For example, add freshly-chopped ginger to teas and soups, and add garlic to sauces, stir-fries, and roasted vegetables. [6] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Generally, fruits (except citrus), vegetables, and whole grains are helpful in preventing acid reflux and keeping the mucus membranes of your throat healthy. It’s also a good idea to cut foods that worsen a sore throat from your diet. Acidic products like chocolate, citrus, and spicy foods cause acid reflux, which can cause or prolong laryngitis."

      "content": "Steam can moisten your vocal cords and clear away sticky mucus. Ensure you have plenty of moist air surrounding you while your voice recovers. One of the easiest ways to do this is to inhale steam from a pot of hot water! You can also add 1 to 2 drops of essential oil to the steaming water for an additional soothing effect.

      "content": "Hot showers create steam, which in turn will soothe your throat. Showers are another great way to use steam to restore your voice. Simply take a daily shower while suffering from laryngitis (or some other form of vocal loss). Close the bathroom’s doors and windows to accumulate as much steam as possible, and breathe deeply as you shower. [9] X Research source If you want to repeat the process but already took a shower that day, you can also run the shower while sitting in your bathroom and take deep breaths instead."

Invest in a cool mist humidifier and set it up in whichever room you’re spending time in, whether that’s an office, kitchen, bedroom, and so on.

Plus, many throat lozenges are made with menthol, which has cooling properties, or benzocaine, which is a local anesthetic. Both of them will make your throat feel less painful while it heals, whether you’re dealing with laryngitis or irritation due to a dry environment.

Follow all instructions on the bottle and take only as much as necessary!

      "content": "Doctors can prescribe medicine, including antibiotics or corticosteroids. Losing your voice often won’t warrant a doctor's visit. Even laryngitis is treatable at home and typically resolves within a week. However, if a bacterial infection causes it, your doctor can prescribe antibiotics to help. Alternatively, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in your throat. [16] X Research source Keep in mind that corticosteroids aren’t for everyone and usually aren’t prescribed unless there’s an urgent need to treat laryngitis. Your doctor will be able to make the final call! Many cases of laryngitis are viral (caused by a cold) rather than bacterial, which is why antibiotics are only helpful in specific instances. See a doctor if your laryngitis lasts longer than 2 weeks or if your symptoms are painful and cause trouble swallowing. It might mean you have chronic laryngitis or laryngitis caused by acid reflux, which requires treatment."
