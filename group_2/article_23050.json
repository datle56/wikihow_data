      "content": "Most people can tan within 1-2 hours. The amount of time it takes to tan depends on a number of factors, including your skin tone . People who are pale often begin to tan or burn within 10-15 minutes, while people with darker skin may only tan after a few hours. Sunburns can also develop in as little as 10 minutes without proper protection, so always remember to wear sunscreen when you’ll be outdoors. [1] X Research source Can you tan in 30 minutes? Some people can tan in 30 minutes, but it depends on your skin type. If you have light or very light skin, you may start to tan within 10 to 30 minutes. If you have darker skin, however, it may take 40 to 60 minutes or more in the sun to start tanning. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Can you get a tan in one day? Yes, you can get a tan in one day. Depending on your skin tone, you may start to tan in as little as 15 minutes. However, tanning too much at one time can lead to sunburn and other skin damage Try laying out for 10-30 minutes every day, and be sure to wear sunscreen when you’re outside. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Does sunscreen prevent you from tanning? SPF 30 is strong enough to block harmful UVA and UVB rays, but not so strong that it completely prevents tanning.

      "content": "Do you tan faster in water or lying out? Floating in water can help you tan faster. The sun’s rays reflect off of water and onto your skin. This means that when you’re floating on top of the water, you’re getting more intense exposure to the sun. Some sources also say the water droplets on your skin act as tiny lenses that help focus sunlight to give you a more intense tan. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that since you’ll tan faster in the water, you may need to take more frequent breaks and apply sunscreen earlier."

      "content": "Is it faster to tan indoors or outdoors? Tanning beds can give you a tan faster, but they’re more dangerous. Tanning beds emit stronger UV rays than natural sunlight, so you can get tan faster than you would by lying in the sun. However, dermatologists strongly advise against using tanning beds, as studies have shown that using them puts you at a much higher risk for skin cancer, especially if you use them regularly. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Research shows that even one tanning bed session can increase your risk of developing melanoma by as much as 20%. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) categorizes tanning beds as carcinogenic. As a safer alternative, consider getting a spray tan or using a bronzing lotion that contains DHA."

A UV index of 3-5 indicates a moderate risk of sunburn for the average person, so as long as you take precautions like wearing sunscreen and seeking shade when needed, you should be able to get a tan. A UV index of 6 or above is considered high, increasing the risk of sunburn and damage significantly, so it’s best to stay out of the sun as tanning isn’t worth the risk. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It’s also safe to tan in UV 1-2, as there’s a minimal risk of sunburn.

Those with pale skin typically burn easily and require less time to tan, while those with darker skin are more resistant to burning and need more time to tan. The Fitzpatrick scale categorizes skin into 6 phototypes based on melanin levels: [8] X Research source Type I (pale white skin): burns easily and rarely/never tans, has the highest risk of sunburn and skin damage, maximum exposure time of less than 15 minutes Type II (white to light beige): usually burns, tans minimally, maximum exposure time of 30-45 minutes Type III (light brown): may burn, tans uniformly, maximum exposure time of 1-2 hours Type IV (moderate brown): minimally burns, tans easily, maximum exposure time of 2-4 hours Type V (dark brown): very rarely burns, tans profusely, maximum exposure time of 4+ hours Type VI (very dark skin): never burns, deeply pigments, maximum exposure time of 4+ hours"

The higher the number, the higher the UV exposure and the chances of skin damage. UV rays are most intense between 10 am and 3 pm, so while lying out during this time can make you tan more quickly, it also increases your chances of sunburn or other damage.

It should be a layer thick enough where you can really see the product on the skin. If you don’t see it going on like it’s a moisturizer, then you might not have enough sunscreen on.” [15] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020."
