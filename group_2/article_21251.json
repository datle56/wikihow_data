      "content": "Introduce insect larvae to your substrate for potent cordyceps. While you can try to grow cordyceps without insect larvae, they’re less likely to grow in grains alone. This type of fungi feeds off of a host, so you’re more likely to get a crop if you incorporate larvae into the substrate. Choose a type of insect larvae that you can obtain in your area. Then, purchase it online or collect the larvae in nature. [10] X Trustworthy Source PLOS ONE Online peer-reviewed, open access scientific research journal Go to source Ghost moth larvae are typically the host insect for cordyceps. However, you might also use silkworm pupa or caterpillars. Ground up silkworm pupa is also an option. You can buy these online. While they’ll likely arrive dead, they can still be a food source for the cordyceps. If you want to harvest larvae, you might check leaves, branches, and the ground for caterpillars. Put the caterpillars in a container and then transfer them to your substrate, along with fresh leaves. Replenish the leaves often so your caterpillars have a food supply."

Then, set the room temperature at around 20 °C (68 °F) if possible. To cool the area, turn on a fan and aim it at your plant. If it’s too cold, use a heat lamp or small space heater to warm the area around your container. [16] X Research source The temperature is very important for growing cordyceps. Make sure it stays within a few degrees of 20 °C (68 °F). Otherwise, your crop may not grow or could be stunted."

Your cordyceps likely won’t grow taller than the top of your jar, so pick them when they reach the lip of the jar. Some cordyceps won’t reach the top of the jar, so go ahead and harvest them when they’ve been growing for 60 days. Harvest them by plucking them from the substrate. [18] X Research source Keep in mind that cordyceps won’t have a second crop, so you don’t need to worry about destroying the root systems. If you’re using a kit, check the instructions to find out when the manufacturer recommends harvesting the cordyceps."
