      "content": "Add 3 c (225 g) of rolled oats to a large bowl. Rolled oats are really the only non-negotiable ingredient in homemade granola. For this basic recipe, they should make up half of your dry ingredient total (3 out of 6 cups). [1] X Research source Any type of rolled oats will work, but old-fashioned rolled oats may provide a better texture than either quick-cook or instant rolled oats."

      "content": "Combine your other dry ingredients with the oats. Use a wooden spoon or your hand to incorporate everything together. Add the following amounts of the other dry ingredients: [2] X Research source 1 c (225 g) nuts (cashews, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, etc.) 1 c (225 g) seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, etc.) 1 c (225 g) other—this could be more nuts or seeds, or another dry ingredient like coconut flakes or puffed millet. However, dried fruit is an add-on that you’ll add later, and doesn’t count here. Likewise, chocolate chips or other add-ons that melt don’t count here and should be added at the end."

      "content": "Mix your wet ingredients in a medium bowl. The wet ingredients make up 1 c (240 mL) total in this recipe, and should be half vegetable oil and half liquid sweetener. Pour the oil and sweetener into a medium bowl, then stir them with a wooden spoon. [3] X Research source Canola oil has the mildest flavor, but extra virgin olive oil and grapeseed oil also work well, depending on the flavor profile of your granola. For liquid sweeteners, try honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, brown rice syrup, or coconut nectar."

      "content": "Preheat your oven and add the granola to a rimmed baking sheet. Set your oven to 300 °F (149 °C). As it preheats, spread your granola out in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. If desired, you can lay parchment paper on the pan first. [5] X Research source Depending on your oven’s temperature accuracy and your preferences on how toasty you like your granola, you may instead choose to set your oven to 275 or 250 °F (135 or 121 °C)."

Pull the granola from the oven every 15 minutes, stir it around with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, smooth it back out into a single layer, and return it to the oven. After 30 minutes, check it every 5 minutes or so for doneness. When it’s golden brown, it’s finished. [6] X Research source Keep checking often, because the granola can go from golden brown to burned quickly!"

Stir in as much and as many kinds of dried fruit as you like—raisins, dried cranberries, and dried cherries are just some of your options. Taste the granola and decide if you want to add any seasoning—maybe a pinch of salt, a spoonful of sugar, or flavors like cinnamon or vanilla. [7] X Research source If you’re adding chocolate chips or another add-in that you don’t want to melt, make sure the granola is completely cooled before mixing it in."

Every 15 minutes, remove the pan from the oven and stir around the granola to ensure even browning. After 1 hour, check the granola often to make sure it doesn’t over-brown. Remove it promptly when it’s golden brown. [11] X Research source You can try increasing the temperature to 300 °F (149 °C) and reducing the baking time to 45 minutes, but you’ll run a slightly greater risk of burning some of the granola."
