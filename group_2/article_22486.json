      "content": "A seroma is a lump or mass that can form after surgery. It is caused by a buildup of clear fluid in a tissue, body cavity, or organ, and it may present as a swollen lump, as if there is liquid under the skin. Seromas may be tender and may also involve yellow or clear fluid draining from the incision site. While most seromas will go away on their own within a few months or, in some cases, a year, certain home remedies can help your seroma reabsorb sooner, such as applying heat or massaging the seroma. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Cancer Institute An agency in the National Institutes of Health focused on cancer research and patient support Go to source Seromas usually form 7 to 10 days after surgery, in places where tissue has been removed, but they may also occur during surgery. Seromas commonly form after breast cancer surgery, cosmetic surgery, plastic reconstructive surgery, hernia repair, or breast implants or reduction."

Seroma drainage, or aspiration, is performed by means of suction, using a syringe to draw fluid from the mass. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A seroma may only need to be drained once, but often, seromas that require draining will be drained multiple times. Your doctor may also give you an ultrasound to get a better sense of the dimensions of the seroma. In some instances, your doctor may give you instructions for draining your seroma yourself at home, but do not attempt to drain your own seroma unless specifically advised by your doctor, as this could cause medical complications."
