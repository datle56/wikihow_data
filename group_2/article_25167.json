Slowly open your mouth in between kisses, and begin to kiss your partner's neck with an open mouth, separating your lips as you gently kiss her skin. You can also move up and down your partner's neck to add some variety. Breathe some hot air on your partner's neck in between kisses. This will drive your partner crazy with pleasure. If you're really getting into it, lick your partner's neck from the bottom to the top. Use only the tip of your tongue and be very gentle. Make sure your partner is enjoying this sensation. Do not do this if it's your first time kissing this person. Confirm it with them first if you're interested, but only do this if you've kissed their neck before or you have some experience with it. This goes for blowing air or using your tongue, and especially for biting and sucking. If it's your very first time, just stick with open and closed mouth kisses. Do this so that you and your partner can discuss anything else that the two of you would be interested in doing."
