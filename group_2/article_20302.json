      "title": "Don't eat anything for two to three hours before sleep.",
      "content": "Don't eat anything for two to three hours before sleep. Your body slows down when you sleep, which will prevent your body from digesting the food in your stomach properly. You are also much less active in the evenings and at night, which means that your body is more likely to store the calories you consume late at night as fat, rather than burning them as energy. Try not to eat anything at least two to three hours before going to bed, or follow the \"daylight diet\", which only allows you to eat during daylight hours."

      "content": "Eat healthier . There's no real secret when it comes to having a flat-tummy friendly diet — you simply need to eat more healthy foods like fruits, veggies, and whole grains, and cut down on junk food, like candy, chips and fast food. Just by making this simple switch, you'll see a world of difference to your stomach. [1] X Expert Source Laura Flinn NASM Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. However, it's not recommended that you go cold turkey — try to ease into a healthy diet by slowly, but consistently replacing the bad with the good. Here are some simple changes you can make: Eat lots of lean protein. Beans, nuts, and lean meat are good for you. Eat whole grains. Look for labels that say \"100% whole grain\" or \"100% whole wheat\" and not just \"wheat flour.\" Whole grains keep you fuller longer, which can help with weight loss and getting a flat tummy. Eat low-fat dairy products. Good dairy options include milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Avoid products high in fat like ice cream and hard cheeses. Eat healthy fats. Not all fat is bad you know! The monounsaturated fats found in avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish oil are actually very good for you, as are the polyunsaturated fats found in seed oils. These can help you to lose weight. Just stay away from the trans fats found in processed foods and baked goods. [2] X Expert Source Laura Flinn NASM Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Lower your sodium intake. Sodium causes your body to retain water, which causes you to look bloated — especially around your abdominal region. Whenever possible, try replacing high-sodium foods with healthier options. Switch regular table salt for kosher or sea salt, which is lower in sodium. Some foods high in sodium include soy sauce, restaurant meals, MSG, cured meats like pepperoni and salami, ham, bacon, sauces, and snack foods. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Reduce your portion sizes.",
      "content": "Reduce your portion sizes. Rather than eating the wrong kinds of foods, many people just eat too much of the right foods. You should eat just enough until you feel full, then stop. If you're eating regular, healthy snacks throughout the day, this shouldn't leave you feeling hungry. One good trick is to use smaller plates when you eat meals. That way, your plate will look like it's heaped with food, but you're actually eating less than you normally would. Also try to fill at least half the plate with vegetables. Try to chew more slowly and thoroughly when you eat. Chewing your food well helps the digestion process in the stomach, leaving you feeling less bloated and gassy. You should chew every bite until it reaches the consistency of applesauce. [4] X Research source Take small breaks in between every bite of food when eating. The extra time will give your stomach a chance to realize that it's full, thus preventing you from over-eating. Raw and unsalted nuts and seeds are especially good snacks when eaten in moderation as they will make you feel more full. Do not eat more than a handful at a time as they can be high in calories."

According to experts, eating a protein-rich snack at the magic hour between three and four in the afternoon will boost your metabolism and balance your blood sugar. A protein bar or shake, a handful of almonds, or pumpkin seeds, or a chunk of low-fat cheese are all good options. Having balanced blood sugars lowers the amount of insulin in your system, which is good because insulin can cause you to store fat around your middle. [7] X Research source"

Many people make the mistake of eating nothing at all between breakfast, lunch, and dinner, especially when they are trying to lose weight. However, this type of diet will negatively effect blood sugar levels and cause you to eat more due to hunger, thus making it harder to lose weight.

You should replace all your regular beverages with water, especially soda and sugared drinks which are full of empty calories and will cause your stomach to bloat. Take water with you wherever you exercise or do strenuous activity and take water breaks during hot or heavy workouts. Drinking lots of water will help to flush toxins out of your system and keep your bowels moving, both of which are essential for a flat stomach. If you find regular water too boring, consider making sassy water instead. Sassy water is simply regular water infused with a number of refreshing and energizing ingredients, which help to speed up the metabolism and cut down on belly fat. Recipes vary, but many include some combination of ingredients such as orange slices, lemon slices, grated ginger, cucumber, fresh spearmint, and fresh basil. The water is left to infuse overnight — making it refreshingly \"sassy\" by the next morning! Pay attention to your body's signs. Your urine should be a light yellow or clear color; dark yellow with an odor could be a sign that you are dehydrated."

Alcohol, particularly wine and beer, is full of calories (scary fact: one 750 ml bottle of wine contains roughly 600 calories). Alcohol consumption also releases estrogen into the system, which is undesirable, as excess estrogen causes the body to retain weight. Perhaps more importantly, alcohol stimulates appetite and causes willpower to melt away, making you much more likely to binge on all the things you've been depriving yourself of, like burgers, fries, pizza, chocolate, and potato chips.

You need to burn the top layer of stomach fat to see the changes. Cardio exercises will heat up your core temperature and improve circulation, both of which will aid in acquiring a flat stomach. Strive for at least 30 minutes a day minimum, but include 1-2 days of rest each week. Activities such as dancing , running , tae-bo, swimming, cycling, and walking at a good pace will all provide a great aerobic workout. In fact, anything that brings your heart rate up will do the trick! Boxing provides an excellent cardio workout, while the muscles involved in throwing punches will help to flatten your stomach. [9] X Research source Try interval cardio training, such as alternating between sprinting and power walking. You can try sprinting for as long as you can. When you become too tired, you should walk. When you feel that you've caught your breath, sprint again. Do these alterations for a total of 20 minutes at a time."

Plyometric exercises are more suitable for experienced athletes than for the less experienced athlete or the older athlete, as there is risk of injury (falls, contusions, tendon injury and sprains). Some great plyometric exercises you can do at home include: Modified jumping jacks. Start standing, then jump up with hands and feet spread apart, creating an \"X\" in the air with your body, then land back in standing. Repeat as many times as you can. Squat-thrust push-ups. Start in push-up position, do one push-up, then push off with your feet and pull your knees up to your chest so your feet land between your hands (still on the ground in push-up position), then jump as high as you can, arms over head. Squat back down with your hands on the floor, then jump back to push-up position again. Do as many as you can do well with good form."

Crunches work the upper abdomen, leg raises work the lower abdomen, and side bends work the obliques (also known as love handles). About 15-25 reps each day should be enough. If you can do more than that, try adding weights to your routine. Note that doing crunches will only build muscle underneath your existing belly fat, but will not burn that fat directly. Try using an exercise ball to work your tummy muscles. One great exercise is called the ball exchange. Lie flat on your back, with your arms extended over your head, holding the exercise ball. Lift the ball above your chest, simultaneously raising your legs (keeping them completely straight) off the ground. Place the ball between your ankles, then lower your arms and legs to the floor. Repeat the exchange, this time passing the ball from your ankles to your hands. Do 10-12 repetitions. [11] X Research source"
