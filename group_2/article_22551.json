      "title": "Invest in a compression shirt.",
      "content": "Invest in a compression shirt. Many men’s clothing companies sell athletic compression shirts made from materials like spandex and neoprene that offer a snug, stretchy fit. These undergarments are designed to provide added stability for the tissue around the torso. For this reason, they make a great base for any outfit that you don't want your midsection mounds to butt in on. Compression shirts come in tank, tee, and long-sleeved styles, which makes them more versatile for pairing with various looks. “Manssieres” are another type of undergarment that are similar to compression shirts. These only cover the chest, however, hence the play on the word “brassiere.”"

      "content": "Size down your undershirts. If you’re not willing or able to shell out the money for a specialty compression top, another option is to buy your first layer one size smaller than you ordinarily would. The resulting fit will keep everything neatly contained without pinching or leaving you gasping for air. [1] X Research source Look for undershirts made from blended fabrics, such as cotton and elastane. These won’t stretch out the way 100% cotton garments will. [2] X Research source If you have a hard time wearing conventional sizes, consider having your t-shirts or tank tops tailored so that they’re tighter under the arms and looser towards the waistline."

      "content": "Select shirts with an in-between fit for optimum concealment. Too-tight tops will show off what you most want to keep under wraps, while overly loose ones often look frumpy and unfashionable, and may suggest that you’ve got something to hide. Your best bet is to pick out shirts that follow your body’s natural contours without squeezing them. [3] X Research source For best results, remember to combine your main upper body clothing items with a restrictive undershirt. Steering clear of ill-fitting clothing is one of the most critical yet frequently overlooked style considerations when it comes to suppressing the secret of your man boobs—it’s not all about what you wear, but also how it wears you."

      "content": "Throw on an extra layer if the weather allows. Coverage is your friend. Pulling a sweater, flannel, button-up, or light jacket over your shirt is one of the quickest and easiest ways to battle man boobs in the cooler months. The rationale here is pretty self-explanatory: the more you have on, the less visible your lumpy bits will be. [4] X Research source Another benefit of layers is that they allow you to add some stylish complexity to your outfit and personalize your look even more. [5] X Research source Make sure you choose outerwear that’s both subtly obscuring and seasonally-appropriate. There’s no sense in making yourself suffer just to keep one part of your body under wraps."

      "content": "Stick to dark colors. [6] X Expert Source Spencer Shimada Image Consultant Expert Interview. 22 October 2021. Dark-colored clothing is well known for having a slimming effect. But as an additional bonus, they help cut down on the contrast between your shirt color and the surrounding light, eliminating those tell-tale lines and shadows that threaten to give away the shape of your chest. [7] X Research source Black, charcoal gray, and navy blue are faithful standbys not only for men with more mammary meat but for most social occasions, as well. Don’t feel like you’re locked into darker shades only. A light gray or pastel shirt will still do a better job of minimizing the appearance of man boobs than a plain white one will.

      "title": "Wear thick, textured fabrics whenever possible.",
      "content": "Wear thick, textured fabrics whenever possible. Canvas, denim, wool, corduroy, leather, and anything else that’s crease- and wrinkle-resistant will generally be a safe choice. Since heavier materials don’t drape limply the way thin, lightweight ones, they’ll do you the favor of “smoothing out” your torso. [9] X Research source Like dark colors, fabrics with lots of surface texture also help prevent light-related reveals."

      "title": "Opt for woven garments over knit ones.",
      "content": "Opt for woven garments over knit ones. Soft knitted garments have a tendency to cling in all the wrong places, which is the last thing you want when you’re trying to keep your moobs incognito. Sturdy woven fabrics, on the other hand, lie flat and hang further away from the body. They typically also lend a sleeker, more put-together appearance, making them a win-win. [10] X Research source When dressing yourself for work or a formal engagement, keep in mind that twill, Oxford, and flannelette shirts are more flattering for a full-chested figure than poplin or sheer fabrics. [11] X Research source The stiffer your shirt is, the more of a shield it will provide. It may not be as conducive to comfort, but it’s effective nonetheless."

      "content": "Pick out small or complex patterns that camouflage your contours. [12] X Expert Source Spencer Shimada Image Consultant Expert Interview. 22 October 2021. Patterned shirts can be something of a double-edged sword—the right ones deftly distract from what’s beneath while the wrong ones highlight it. As a rule, you want to favor patterns that are smaller and closer together, as these run more visual interference. [13] X Research source Narrow vertical stripes and miniature all-over-print designs are especially useful for creating a lean, streamlined profile."

      "content": "Deck yourself out with accent pieces that lure eyes elsewhere. Use bold, colorful, and extravagant accessories as a kind of fashion diversion. A flashy wristwatch or pair of two-toned shoes can provide an alternative focal point and keep your midline hidden in plain sight. Some other items you might put to your advantage include vintage-inspired hats, stylish eyewear, and functional props like bags and briefcases. Try not to make yourself look too ridiculous. The idea behind strategic accessorizing is to trick the people around you into focusing on other things. Dressing like a rodeo clown may accomplish this, but not in the way you want."

      "content": "Avoid attracting unnecessary attention to your chest area. Make sure there’s nothing going on in the pec-portion of your outfit that might make someone stop and take notice. Low necklines, accessories like necklaces and chains, and even poorly-positioned breast pockets and logos could all inadvertently draw an onlooker’s gaze. [14] X Research source If you prefer to leave your dress shirts undone around the neck, be careful not to button them too low, or set out a crew neck undershirt to wear with them."
