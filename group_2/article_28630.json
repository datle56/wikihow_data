      "content": "Take your front bust measurement. Hold one end of a measuring tape at the far side of your bust. This is where the outside edge of your bra cup is positioned. Place the tape horizontally across the fullest part of your bust until you reach the outside edge of your bust on the other side. Make note of the length; this will be your front bust measurement. Remember to stand upright, keep the tape measure parallel to the ground, and be sure your elbows are held close to your body. Avoid lifting your arms as this will distort the measurement. To get the most accurate measurement, have someone assist you."

      "content": "Subtract 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) to determine the bikini top's front width. The amount you subtract will vary based on your bust size and how tight you want the top to be. It should also incorporate a narrow 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance. For a smaller bust or tighter fit, subtract 4 in (10 cm). For a larger bust or looser fit, subtract 2 in (5.1 cm). This number will become the width of the two cups when measured horizontally across the front of your bust. Consider this your bikini top's front width measurement. For example, if your front bust measurement is 18 in (46 cm) and you have a moderately sized bust, you might decide to subtract 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm). Your finished bikini top's front width will be 15 in (38 cm), plus the 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance on both sides. If you prefer to use a wider seam allowance, just add this into your measurement. You can also draw in both the finished line (which is where you'll sew, and indicates the edges of the finished garment) as well as the cut line (which includes the seam allowance) if you wish."

      "title": "Determine your bikini top's height, based on the coverage you want.",
      "content": "Determine your bikini top's height, based on the coverage you want. This measurement will typically be at least 5 to 7 in (13 to 18 cm) when finished, plus 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance. It depends on your bust size and how much coverage you want. If you have a larger bust or desire more coverage, more height will give you fuller coverage. If you have a smaller bust or desire less coverage, go with a lower height measurement. If you're not sure, measure the height of your favorite bra or bikini top for reference. Then, add 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) for seam allowance around all sides."

      "content": "Draw a rectangle on your fashion fabric using width and height measurements. Place fashion fabric (the material you'll use for the outer part of the bikini) with its right-side facing down onto a flat surface. Use a ruler and a fabric marking pencil or chalk to draw a rectangle onto the wrong side of the fabric. Its dimensions will be your bikini top's front width by height. For example, if you determined a top length of 15 in (38 cm) and desire 7 in (18 cm) of height, your rectangle will measure 15 by 7 in (38 by 18 cm). When selecting your fashion fabric, the best choice is something that's specifically marketed for use in swimwear, since it will provide the right amount of stretch, water absorption, and colorfastness. Try searching under the performance fabric category of a few online fabric stores to find your favorite print. If your fabric has a stripe or other printed pattern, position your pattern pieces in the correct orientation out so that the design will appear upright once the garment's finished. You wouldn't want sideways zebra stripes or upside-down letters, after all! If there is a particular motif you want visible on the swimsuit, such as a large flower, center your pattern piece around that."

If you want it to be gathered more tightly or more loosely, shorten or lengthen this vertical line accordingly. For lining fabric, use something of a similar quality and fiber content to your fashion fabric in a solid color.

To create left and right pieces for the back of your bikini top, you'll draw out a few pieces onto your main fabric in the shape of long and narrow right triangles. Use the dimension of the bikini top's height to start. The back pieces will later be sewn to the bikini top front at the side seam, so it's important that the heights match. [1] X Research source You've cut out the pieces for the front half of your bikini top, but the back ties will complete the band that goes all the way around your torso. The loose ends will be knotted at center-back when it's finished. If you determined a top height of 7 in (18 cm) and a length of 15 in (38 cm), Each back tie piece will measure 7 by 15 in (18 by 38 cm). Combined, the back ties will be 30 in (76 cm) wide which allows plenty of fabric for tying a knot."
