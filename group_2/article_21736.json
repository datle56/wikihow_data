      "content": "Hammer nails into the border of the door about every 12 in (30 cm). Use 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) nails, depending on the thickness of the door, to ensure that the nails don't come out of the other side. Hammer in nails about 12 in (30 cm) apart from each other either around the frame or the door or in a circle in the center of the door. Only hammer in about half of the nail into the door so there is something to hang the garland off of later on. Make sure the nails you use have a large head, so that the garland doesn't slip off and fall. Place nails diagonally in the grooves of the door to hide the nail holes later on. If you put holes directly into the flat parts of the door, they will be more obvious to the naked eye. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Stick nails into the grout of the rock or stone around the door for a well-hidden option. If your door is surrounded by rock or stonework, consider hanging the wreath around the frame of the door by hammering in nails every 12 in (30 cm) into the grout or mortar. You may need a drill to make holes effectively. This will reduce the amount of damage you do to your front door, and the nail holes will be much less noticeable. Whereas holes in the wood of a door are very difficult to hide, holes in stonework can be covered with a fresh layer of grout."

      "title": "Wrap wire around the garland so it can hang from the nails.",
      "content": "Wrap wire around the garland so it can hang from the nails. Loop fishing wire, decorative ribbon, or thin string around the garland, leaving a loose piece of wire at the top of the garland. You will hang the garland from this loose piece of wire, so be sure that it is located at the middle or top so it hangs symmetrically. Decorative ribbon or fishing wire are optimal as thin string can deteriorate with time and in the elements, although it does give the garland a rustic aesthetic."

      "content": "Hang the garland on the nails and make sure it stays supported and stable. Hang the wire around each hook and make sure the garland stays in place by opening and closing the door a few times. Your garland will frame the door if you put in nails around the border, or it will appear centered if you put in nails in the door's center."

      "title": "Use removable adhesive hooks to hang the garland without leaving marks.",
      "content": "Use removable adhesive hooks to hang the garland without leaving marks. Attach adhesive hooks around the frame of the door about 12 in (30 cm) apart. Wrap the garland in wire, and wait a few minutes for the adhesive to bond with the door before you hang the garland by its wire. The hooks will come off of the door easily when you are ready to take down the decoration and are easily hidden by the garland itself. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you can hang just 3 hooks about 12 in (30 cm) apart from each other at the top of the door to make the garland hang, but without hooks on the sides of the frame it could get caught in the door."

      "content": "Secure a doorway garland hanger to the door for a reusable option. A doorway garland hanger is similar to a home pull-up bar, which can be lengthened to fit the dimensions of your doorway. [3] X Research source Adjust its width to fit between two large grooves in the door, and hang the garland from its center hook. A doorway hanger should only be used on doors with a recess so it connects directly to the door. Don't attach the doorway garland hanger to the outside frame of the door or you won't be able to open it."

      "content": "Attach an upside-down adhesive hook to the back of the door to hide the hook. Instead of attaching adhesive hooks to the front of the door, attach an upside down hook to the back of the door near the top. [4] X Research source Then, wrap a ribbon around it and bring the ribbon over the top of the frame to the front of the door. Attach the garland to this ribbon and it will hang from the front without the hook anywhere to be seen! This is especially effective for garlands that won't cover the adhesive hooks to onlookers, and is a good use of resources if you don't want to spend too much on supplies as you only need one hook.

      "content": "Wrap the garland in stringed Christmas lights. Christmas is the perfect time of year to hang a garland, and while it is beautiful on its own, you can wrap christmas lights around the garland to make it stand out and bring light to the night! Just wrap stringed lights around the whole garland and hang it on the front door as you wish. [6] X Research source Battery-powered Christmas lights are optimal as you won't have to keep them plugged in anywhere to keep them on. Use low-power Christmas lights with a natural garland to reduce the risk of causing a fire. If you want to use bright and hot lights, opt for a fake or plastic garland instead, as there is a reduced risk of the material getting too hot."

Use flowers that fit the season — poinsettias and holly look wonderful in winter, and roses and fall leaves fit the fall season. Hang themed baubles from the garland to make it look like a Christmas tree hanging from your door! It doesn't really matter which flowers you choose to decorate the garland with, as long as they suit the season and make it pop!"

Everybody wants to have a white christmas, but if the snow doesn't come, you can bring that hopeful spirit to your home by spraying your garland with fake snow. You should be able to find it at most holiday stores or hardware stores in the holiday section. If it does snow where you life, add some real snow to the garland instead to make it look more authentically dusted!"

Hang a garland on the borders of your door, and attach a holiday wreath to the center of the door. [7] X Research source The natural look will impress guests and make your arrangement look even more classically beautiful. If your garland is especially thick, you may not have room to hang a wreath in the center. Use a thin garland to frame the door so it doesn't bring attention away from the centerpiece wreath."

      "content": "Create a seasonal side table just next to the front door. Place a small side table just outside your door with bowls of fruit, figurines (of the nativity in Christmas, for example) and other seasonal pieces to make your entryway stand out. [8] X Research source If you are feeling particularly charitable, consider leaving small gifts and wrapped snacks on the table for guests to make them feel welcome and bring the holiday spirit of sharing to all your visitors. Wrap more garland around the legs of the table to complement the garland on your front door. [9] X Research source For example, in winter, small toys for kids and wrapped candies fit the theme of christmas well, while in fall a fruit bowl and pumpkin arrangement bring the harvest aesthetic to life. In spring and summer, leave an arrangement of seasonal flowers to beautify the entrance to your home."
