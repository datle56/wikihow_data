      "content": "Ensure the machine is compatible with this method. Only Coca-Cola machines with LED displays which have some form of scrolling text will allow you to access the debug menu, and even then, some machines will have access to the debug menu disabled. Picking a Coke machine that's in a high-traffic public space, such as a rest stop or a hotel lobby, is more likely to yield access to the debug menu. If the LED display just displays a price, this method won't work."

      "content": "Know which buttons correspond to numbers. You'll have to use the product selection buttons as the number entry method. Depending on the machine, this will vary: Keypad — The numbered keys should work as labelled for this method. Rectangular buttons — The top rectangular button corresponds to the number 1 , the next-down button corresponds to 2 , and so on. Large buttons — The top-left corner button is number 1 , the one to its right is number 2 , and so on. In the second row, the left-most button is 5 , and the next-over button is 6 . Two-by-three — The top-left corner button is 1 , the next one to its right is 3 , and so on. The left-most button on the second row is 4 , etc."

If nothing happens when you enter the access code, your selected vending machine probably doesn't support access to the debug menu.

VER or CASH — Displays the version number ( VER ); Displays the current amount of cash in the machine ( CASH ). While both of these options may be available, CASH is usually only on older machines.
