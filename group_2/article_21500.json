      "title": "Pick out a fresh pineapple.",
      "content": "Pick out a fresh pineapple. Choose a pineapple with perky green leaves that have not turned yellow or brown. The skin on the fruit should be golden brown and have a little bit of give when you squeeze it. Smell the pineapple to see if it's ripe , too. It should emit a sweet, heady smell. [1] X Research source Your pineapple needs to be ripe in order to grow into a plant, so make sure it isn't underripe. An underripe pineapple is usually very green, hard, and has a faint smell. Check that your pineapple isn't overripe, too. Overripe pineapples are easy to squish and often have wrinkled skin. Tug gently at the leaves, too. If they come right off, the pineapple is too ripe to plant. Make sure the pineapple doesn't have scale insects around the base of the leaves. They look like small grayish black spots."

      "title": "Twist the leaves off the top of the pineapple.",
      "content": "Twist the leaves off the top of the pineapple. Grasp the body of the pineapple with one hand and use your other to grab the base of the leaves. Simply twist the leaves to pull them off the pineapple. You are now left with the crown, or stem, of the pineapple, and the pineapple fruit. [2] X Research source If you're having trouble twisting off the crown, slice off the top of the pineapple with a knife. Then, cut off any excess fruit around the crown. When twisting the leaves off, do it gently to make sure the crown stays intact. New roots sprout from the end of the stem, so without it the plant can’t grow."

    {
      "title": "Strip off some of the lower leaves to expose more of the stem.",
      "content": "Strip off some of the lower leaves to expose more of the stem. Removing the bottom leaves helps the stem sprout roots once it is planted. Just pull away a few of the bottom leaves so several inches of the stem is exposed. If there is any fruit still attached to the stem, cut it away with a knife, being careful not to cut into the stem. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn the crown upside down and leave it to dry for a week.",
      "content": "Turn the crown upside down and leave it to dry for a week. The inside of the pineapple crown is still wet when you cut it, so it needs to dry out. Planting a moist stem can encourage rotting, giving your pineapple less of a chance to grow. Just place the stem upside down in your kitchen to fully dry out for about 1 week. [4] X Research source Once the stem is dry, it is fine to plant into well-draining soil . It’s not necessary to put it in water first, but it is helpful to know when it starts growing roots. Plus, it’s fun to watch!"

      "title": "Fill a large glass with water.",
      "content": "Fill a large glass with water. To grow strong, healthy roots, your pineapple crown needs a lot of water. Choose a glass that’s large enough to fit the pineapple crown inside, but small enough so the pineapple can be propped up without getting completely submerged. Then, fill the glass up with water."

      "title": "Stick toothpicks into the pineapple crown to suspend it in the water.",
      "content": "Stick toothpicks into the pineapple crown to suspend it in the water. To make sure only the bottom of the crown is in water, place 4 toothpicks around the top of the stem. Push them in just far enough so that they'll stay in place. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the pineapple crown in the water.",
      "content": "Put the pineapple crown in the water. Rest the toothpicks on the rim of the glass. The bottom of the stem should now be submerged in the water, while the leaves stick out the top. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the crown in bright, indirect light and wait for roots to sprout.",
      "content": "Place the crown in bright, indirect light and wait for roots to sprout. Pineapple plants love light, so find it a warm place to rest where it gets lots of filtered light. Over the next 3 to 6 weeks, little white roots will start to poke out of the stem and begin to grow. [7] X Research source Pineapples grow best at temperatures between 65 to 85° F (18-30° C), so keep it away from drafts and harsh, direct light. Change out the water every few days to prevent mold from growing."

      "title": "Fill a 6 inch (15 cm) pot with well-draining soil.",
      "content": "Fill a 6 inch (15 cm) pot with well-draining soil . Pineapple plants are drought-tolerant and don’t love to sit in soggy, moist soil. Choose a well-draining garden soil that has a 30% blend of organic matter. This allows excess water to drain out of the pot and gives your pineapple the right blend of nutrients to grow healthily. When choosing a pot for your pineapple plant, make sure it has drainage holes at the bottom."

      "title": "Plant the crown in the pot once its roots are 3 inches (7 cm) long.",
      "content": "Plant the crown in the pot once its roots are 3 inches (7 cm) long. When the stem has lots of long, thick roots, it’s time to put it in soil. Poke a hole into the soil with your fingers and nestle the pineapple crown inside. Make sure that the base of the leaves are just above soil level. Then, press the soil firmly around the base of the stem and water it thoroughly."

      "title": "Set the planted pineapple in bright light and keep its soil moist.",
      "content": "Set the planted pineapple in bright light and keep its soil moist. Your new pineapple plant needs a warm, sunny, and humid environment to grow big and strong. Let it adjust to bright, indirect light for about 2 to 3 weeks before moving your plant to a place where it gets at least 6 hours of direct light. Water it about once a week, or when the top 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) of soil are dry. [8] X Research source If you live in a warm climate, keep the pot outside if you prefer. When temperatures start to drop below 60° F (15° C), take your pineapple plant inside. To help your plant root faster, make a mini-greenhouse over its pot. Simply slip a plastic bag over the top of the pot, removing it when you water."

      "title": "Fertilize your pineapple plant about once a month.",
      "content": "Fertilize your pineapple plant about once a month. Giving your plant nutritious fertilizer helps it grow strong. In the spring and summer, fertilize it once or twice a month with water-soluble fertilizer. In the fall and winter, feed it only once a month. [9] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Pineapple plants generally prefer fertilizer with a 10-10-10 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium."

      "title": "Wait for flowers and fruit to grow in 1 to 3 years.",
      "content": "Wait for flowers and fruit to grow in 1 to 3 years. Be patient, as it can take several years for your plant to grow the flowers that develop into a juicy pineapple. As you continue to water and care for your plant, eventually a red cone will appear from the center of the leaves. It will be followed by blue flowers and eventually a tiny, budding fruit. The pineapple fruit takes about six months to fully develop. [10] X Research source The pineapple fruit grows from the flower, above ground, in the center of the plant. When the pineapple fruit is ripe and ready to be harvested, cut it off from the stem, just below the base of the fruit. Don’t cut your pineapple off before it’s ripe, as it won’t ripen once it’s off the stem."
