      "title": "Wear a black shirt and black pants to go underneath the costume.",
      "content": "Wear a black shirt and black pants to go underneath the costume. Keep all of the clothing under your cloak black. Your cloak’s fabric is probably breathable, and colors may bleed through a little if you don’t wear black clothing. Wear a black long sleeve shirt or sweater and some black jeans under the cloak. [1] X Research source The vast majority of grim reaper outfits require a black cloak, so the style of clothing underneath your cloak isn’t particularly important."

      "title": "Buy a black cloak with a hood from a costume store.",
      "content": "Buy a black cloak with a hood from a costume store. The best way to get a decent cloak for your outfit is to swing by a costume store and buy one. These cloaks are extremely cheap, and you can try it on before buying it. Get a black cloak with a hood. If possible, get a cloak that goes all the way down to your feet to cover your legs entirely. [2] X Research source You can go for an all-white cloak if you want to go for a more spectral, ghostly grim reaper vibe. It’s pretty easy to update an old wizard outfit, vampire robe, witch outfit, or some other costume to make your cloak. Just dye the outfit black or paint it black with spray paint.

      "title": "Pin the cloak near the top with a brooch.",
      "content": "Pin the cloak near the top with a brooch. Pick up a simple brooch from any clothing or department store, borrow a brooch from a family member’s wardrobe, or grab a simple plastic brooch from a costume store. Pin the two layers of the cloak near the top of your chest to keep the cloak from floating away. [4] X Research source A brooch with a skull on it is ideal and will work really well. If the brooch is black, it will blend into the cloak, so this is a good option if you don’t want it to stand out. You can use a safety pin instead of a brooch if you’re going for an edgier look or don’t necessarily care about the pin looking out of place."

      "content": "Wrap some brown twine or rope around your waist to make the belt. Cut a length of brown twine or rope to be 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) longer than your waist. Then, wrap the twine or rope around your waist. Loop the two ends around each other and tie the twine or rope to create a belt. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear black shoes if your feet are visible while you’re wearing the cloak.",
      "content": "Wear black shoes if your feet are visible while you’re wearing the cloak. If the cloak is long enough that it covers your feet, you really don’t need to worry about your footwear. If your feet are visible though, put on some all-black sneakers or boots. Wear long black socks to hide the skin above your feet. [6] X Research source The shoes aren’t a key component of the outfit, so don’t worry about doing anything fancy with your feet. Literally any pair of black shoes will work."

      "title": "Get some black gloves to make the entire outfit black if you’d like.",
      "content": "Get some black gloves to make the entire outfit black if you’d like. If you’re going all out, put on some black gloves. Any black gloves will work so long as they aren’t winter gloves. Alternatively, you can pick up a thin set of black gloves from a costume store to disguise your skin. [7] X Research source Gloves won’t make or break an outfit, so don’t worry about it if you can’t a set of gloves to go with your cloak."

      "title": "Purchase a prop scythe from a costume store for an easy option.",
      "content": "Purchase a prop scythe from a costume store for an easy option. You can buy a prop scythe from a costume store for $5-10. If you’re going for a simple grim reaper outfit, this is the best option since there’s no work involved and it won’t be particularly expensive. Get a scythe that’s tall enough to reach your shoulders or a little longer based on your personal preferences. [8] X Research source A scythe is basically a stick with a curved blade on the end. It’s the weapon most often associated with the grim reaper, although there are other options available if you prefer."

      "content": "Make your own scythe using a large branch and cardboard. To make your own scythe, first get a large branch that is at least as tall as your shoulders. Paint the branch black with spray paint. Cut out a curved piece of cardboard and paint it silver to make the blade. Then, use 2-4 screws to drill the taller side of the cardboard to the top of the branch to make your scythe. [10] X Research source You can use a broom handle, pvc pipe, or shovel handle instead of a branch if you prefer."

      "title": "Carry a staff if you’re going to an event with a weapon restriction.",
      "content": "Carry a staff if you’re going to an event with a weapon restriction. Many Halloween events, costume parties, and school dances have a restriction on costume weapons. If this is the case, paint a branch black or pick up a staff from the costume store. The grim reaper is often depicted carrying a staff instead of a scythe, so your outfit will still look great! [11] X Research source You can put a fake skull on top of the staff if you still want to go for a creepy look."

There are a few other options if you want to go for a different look or you don’t feel like lugging a staff or scythe around. You can take a large clock or hourglass with you. Alternatively, you can carry a hooded lantern on a chain. [12] X Research source The grim reaper is often depicted with a clock or hourglass because the grim reaper appears when “your time is up.” The grim reaper’s lantern is a reference to the Greek myth of Charon, the ferryman that takes the dead across the River Styx to the afterlife. Charon is often depicted holding a lantern or with a lantern on their boat."

Stop by your local costume store and look through their collection of masks to find one you like.

Put some black around the eyes and jaw. Add some grey to the cheeks and forehead to give the mask some depth. You can also make the teeth pointer or expand the eye slots using a piece of sandpaper or a file. [15] X Research source If you want to give your mask some backing, pick up a cheap Scream mask and peel the face off of the fabric. Then, use hot glue to adhere the thin fabric to the back of your skull mask. This will hide your face entirely and the only thing people will see is the floating skull under the hood!"

Then, dip a cotton ball or cotton pad into the white paint and build up the foundation on your face. Add some black around your eyes, forehead, and the edges of your cheeks to give your look some depth. [16] X Research source You can use a face paint pen to draw in some creepy, skeletal teeth around your lips if you’d like. If you paint your face and you don’t have any gloves, paint your hands all-white or draw some bones on top of your hands."
