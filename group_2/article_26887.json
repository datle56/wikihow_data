      "content": "Combine distilled water, dish soap, and glycerin to make a simple bubble solution. Pour 6 c (1,400 mL) of distilled water into a really big container, along with 1 c (240 mL) of liquid dish soap. Thoroughly stir both of these ingredients together and add in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of glycerin. Mix everything together until the solution is completely stirred up. [1] X Research source Glycerin makes your bubbles more sturdy and durable. [2] X Research source The distilled water also helps make higher-quality bubbles, but you can use tap water if you don’t have any on hand. If you don’t have any glycerin lying around, use 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of corn syrup instead. Check the label of your liquid dish soap as you mix all of your ingredients together. If it says “Ultra,” add in 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of glycerin (or 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of corn syrup). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the glycerin mixture rest overnight to make your bubbles even more long-lasting. Secure a lid on top of your bubble solution and leave it be until the next day. You don’t have to do this if you’re in a rush, though—you can still blow lots of great bubbles without having to wait! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix white sugar, dish soap, and water together to make a glycerin-free bubble solution. Pour 1 c (240 mL) of water into a bowl or container, along with 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of liquid dish soap. Then, add 1 tbsp (12.5 g) of extra-fine white sugar. Stir everything together until the sugar completely dissolves into the solution. Your bubble mixture is now ready to go! [5] X Research source The sugar binds to the water and helps keep it from evaporating as quickly."

      "content": "Create classic bubbles with a homemade pipe cleaner bubble wand. Bend and twist one end of a pipe cleaner so it resembles a circular bubble wand. If you’re feeling extra creative, twist your pipe cleaner into fun shapes, like stars, triangles, or squares. Simply dip the pipe cleaner into the bubble solution, blow through the opening, and watch the bubbles float away! [6] X Research source For plenty of old-school fun, use some plastic bubble wands instead."

      "content": "Blow lots of tiny bubbles with a drinking straw . Dunk one end of a plastic straw into your bubble solution. Then, lift up your straw and blow through it (almost like you’re making a spitball). The straw’s small opening will create lots of fun, tiny bubbles. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make big, chunky bubbles with a plastic funnel . Dip the large, rounded end of a plastic funnel into your homemade bubble solution. Then, blow through the thin end of the funnel to make a big bubble. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a funnel on hand, make your own by slicing off the tapered end of a soda bottle. You can also cut a hole in the bottle of a plastic cup and create bubbles by blowing through the opening."

      "content": "Create huge bubbles with a bubble wand made of cotton string and straws. Measure and cut 2 plastic drinking straws so they’re each 6 in (15 cm) long. Then, loop and knot a 30 in (76 cm) section of cotton string through both of the straws, creating a large, rectangular shape. As a finishing touch, make “handles” by slipping 2 more straws into the ends of the existing straws. [9] X Research source To make giant bubbles, dip the big bubble wand into a large, shallow basin of bubble solution. Then, lift the wand out of the bubble mixture and slowly separate the handles so the string is stretched out. This gradual movement creates a really big bubble. A plastic-coated wire clothes hanger can also make super big bubbles. [10] X Research source"
