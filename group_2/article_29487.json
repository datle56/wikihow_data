      "content": "Remove a 4.5 by 11 in (11 by 28 cm) strip from 2 sheets of printer paper. Take a sheet of 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) printer paper and lay it flat on a surface. Bring 1 of the corners across the sheet, connecting it with the opposite edge. Line up the edges so they’re even and form a triangle, leaving a strip 4.5 by 11 inches (11 by 28 cm) long above the triangle. Use a pair of scissors to cut off the strip, then repeat the process with the other sheet of paper. [1] X Research source You could also use construction paper or cardstock to make a sturdier shuriken. If you already have square origami paper, use 2 sheets of that instead. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the paper in half to make a center crease. Take 1 of the sheets of paper and fold it in half to make a book fold. Make a strong crease in the center and then unfold the paper. Repeat the process with the other sheet of paper so you’re left with 2 sheets with a center crease. Press the creases with your thumbnail to ensure clean folds, and make sure you’re folding on a flat surface for the best results. [3] X Research source Because both sheets are squares, it doesn’t matter which end you fold."

      "title": "Bring in both sides of the paper to meet the crease in the middle.",
      "content": "Bring in both sides of the paper to meet the crease in the middle. Use the center crease to divide the sheet of paper in half. Fold 1 side of the sheet into the crease, then, bring the other side into the center crease and fold it to create a cupboard fold. Fold the other sheet of paper the same way so they match. [4] X Research source Both sheets of paper need to match perfectly."

      "title": "Take both sides and bring them into the center crease to form a strip.",
      "content": "Take both sides and bring them into the center crease to form a strip. Fold the 2 sides of the paper into each other so the paper looks like a long, thin strip. Crease the paper well, then fold the other sheet the same way. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a center crease by folding the strips in half horizontally.",
      "content": "Make a center crease by folding the strips in half horizontally. Take 1 of the strips and bring the top of the paper to meet the bottom. Make a strong crease, then unfold it to leave the crease in the center of the paper. Then, make a crease in the other strip of paper. [6] X Research source Make sure the top and bottom edges line up so your crease is perfectly centered. The crease will form a point of reference to help you fold your shuriken evenly."

      "content": "Fold the left side down and the right side up at the centerline. Take 1 of the strips and hold it horizontally. Fold the left side down to form a 45-degree angle at the centerline crease. Then, fold the right side up to form another 45-degree angle at the centerline. [7] X Research source The folded part will extend past the horizontal strip. Make sure you crease the paper well so the folds are nice and tight."

Use your fingers to squeeze the fold and make a tight crease. [10] X Research source The creases are important for allowing you to make edges on your finished shuriken."

Then, lay the other strip across the center so the triangles are also pointing down. [11] X Research source Make sure the folded papers are centered so your shuriken is even."

Take 1 of the triangles of the bottom strip of paper, wrap it over the paper on top, and slide it into the fold in the center of the top paper. Then, tuck the other folded triangle of the bottom paper into the new fold created after you tuck the first triangle end into the top paper. [12] X Research source You should have only 2 triangle ends sticking out."

Run your fingers over the surface to smooth out any folds or wrinkles so you’re left with a crisp and clean paper shuriken. [14] X Research source Don’t throw the paper shuriken at somebody. The pointy ends could injure an eye."
