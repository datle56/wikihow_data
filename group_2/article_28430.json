      "content": "Apply the highlighter to the bridge of your nose. Apply a thin line of highlighting concealer down the center of the bridge of your nose.

      "content": "Add the darker makeup to the sides of your nose. Use your contouring pencil or take a thin, angled brush to draw lines down the sides of your nose. Start near the inner corner of each eye, and shade straight down to the end of your nose. The closer you put your lines to the center of your nose, the thinner your nose will appear. Practice until you find your desired width of your contoured nose. If you have wide nostrils, add a bit of this darker shade to your nostrils as well [2] X Research source"
