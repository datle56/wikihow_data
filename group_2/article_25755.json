      "content": "Consider decisive factors before choosing a method. There are several systems of shorthand, and they differ from one another. You need to consider a few different things: [2] X Research source How much time do you have to learn the system? How fast do you ultimately want to be able to write? Is there a standard system of shorthand for your profession?"

      "content": "Choose Gregg Pre-Anniversary, Gregg Anniversary, or New Era Pitman for maximum speed. Gregg and Pitman have been the leading competing systems in English shorthand since the 19th century, and both have been adapted to several other languages, as well. [3] X Research source Gregg was developed by John Robert Gregg in 1888 and has since undergone several adaptations. Gregg Pre-Anniversary and Anniversary refer to the system as outlined in 1916 and 1929, respectively. There is a heavy load of symbols to memorize, but the trade-off is writing over 200 words per minute. [4] X Research source Pitman was developed by Sir Isaac Pitman in 1837. New Era Pitman, a streamlined version of the original theory dating back to 1922, is quite complex but also lets you write over 200 words per minute. [5] X Research source pitman Since thick and thin strokes represent different pairs of sounds, you'll need a steel-tipped pen to write. Also, you need lined paper, since the lines are also part of the system. [6] X Research source"

This version, introduced by McGraw-Hill in 1949, was the first shorthand intended for business rather than court reporting. There are significantly fewer things to memorize compared with Gregg Anniversary. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an alphabetic system if you want a fast, easy learning process. Unlike symbol systems, where lines, curves and circles represent sounds, alphabetic systems are based on the alphabet. This makes them easier to learn, though you won't be able to achieve the same rapid speeds. Still, a good speedwriter could get up to 120 words per minute. [9] X Research source Three examples of these are Speedwriting, AlphaHand, and Keyscript."

If you want to practice as much as possible, put dictations on your MP3 player and practice whenever you have a few extra minutes. [17] X Research source"
