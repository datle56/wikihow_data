      "title": "Learn as much as you can about ball jointed dolls.",
      "content": "Learn as much as you can about ball jointed dolls. Read online articles about bjds (ball jointed dolls). Familiarize yourself with how they are constructed and strung together. If possible, try to handle a bjd in person. Lastly, be familiar with the metric system, especially if you plan to sell your sculpt. Ball jointed dolls are always measured in centimeters. Their eyes are always measured in millimeters. If you plan to sell your sculpt, use these as your primary measurements. Ball jointed doll forums and social media groups are great places learn more about these dolls."

      "title": "Choose the size of doll you want to make.",
      "content": "Choose the size of doll you want to make. There are 3 main sizes of bjds: yoSD, MSD, and SD. SDs are typically 55 to 57 cm (22 to 22 in) tall. They are sometimes called SD10. SD13 are typically 57 to 60 cm (22 to 24 in) tall. You can also get them larger: 65 to 72 cm (26 to 28 in). MSDs are typically 42 to 44 cm (17 to 17 in) tall. Yo-SDs are typically 26.5 cm (10.4 in) tall. [1] X Research source SD stands for \"Super Dollfie,\" MSD stands for \"Mini Super Dollfie,\" and \"Yo SD\" stands for \"Yo Super Dollfie.\" [2] X Research source The larger your doll is, the more expensive it will be to cast."

      "title": "Decide whether you want a child-like or mature-looking doll.",
      "content": "Decide whether you want a child-like or mature-looking doll. Most SD dolls tend to have mature proportions with full breasts or defined muscles. Some of them can have softer, more child-like bodies, such as the dolls made by Volks. MSD dolls tend to have child-like, but you can get mature ones too, like the Fairyland MiniFee. Most yoSD dolls have childlike features, but you can make one that is more mature and slender. Mature yoSDs are usually known as mature tinies."

    {
      "title": "Decide between a realistic or stylistic style.",
      "content": "Decide between a realistic or stylistic style. Bjds are closely related to Dollfie Dreams, which look like anime characters. As such, even realistic bjds have slightly longer legs, bigger busts, and narrower waists than the average human. Some sculptors like to make their dolls even more stylized, with long, slender, willowy bodies. A great example are Dollzone and Doll Chateau dolls. Consider making an anthro or animal doll. They tend to be yoSD sized with childlike proportions. Cats and rabbits are the most popular."

      "title": "Draw a full-sized, anatomical sketch of your doll from the front and side.",
      "content": "Draw a full-sized, anatomical sketch of your doll from the front and side. One of the things that makes a bjd different from other dolls is that they are anatomically correct. This means that male dolls have penises and female dolls have vaginal slits. [3] X Research source The sketch needs to match the size of the doll you are making in centimeters/inches. The genitals do not have to be realistic or highly-detailed. They can be a simple bulge or slit."

    {
      "title": "Add the joints in the arms, legs, and head.",
      "content": "Add the joints in the arms, legs, and head. A basic bjd will have joints in the following area: ankles, knees, thighs/hips, wrists, elbows, and arms/shoulders. It will also have 1 or 2 joints in the torso, as well as a joint in the neck/base of head. A torso joint is typically in 1 of the following areas: ribcage/waist, under-bust, or hips (underwear line). Some dolls are double-jointed in the elbows and knees. This means that the joint is a separate piece that fits into the knee and elbow sockets. The thighs fit into sockets in the hips, and have a vertical slit for the elastic so that the doll can sit. Some dolls have a separate joint in the upper thigh. This joint is a clean, horizontal line."

      "content": "Add a sketch for the core, if desired. You don't have to do this, but you can if you want to. The core will simply help you figure out how big to make the hollow parts of the doll. You can draw the core on tracing paper, then tape it over your sketch, or you can dry the core directly onto your sketch."

      "title": "Ensure that your doll will fit other companies' eyes, wigs, and shoes.",
      "content": "Ensure that your doll will fit other companies' eyes, wigs, and shoes. Bjds come bald and without eyes. While you can make wigs and eyes yourself, these can be time consuming, difficult, and expensive. Most people just buy the eyes, wigs, and shoes from various bjd companies. To make your shopping easier, ensure that your doll fits the standard sizes. BJD eyes are sold in even sized numbers ranging from 6 mm to 24 mm. BJD wigs are sold in inches based on the head circumference. A 7.5 wig will fit a doll with a 7 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 in (19 cm) head. BDS shoes are sold in mm sizes. Your doll's foot needs to be small enough to fit inside the shoe."

Make the head, limbs, and torso separate pieces, but don't add any joints yet. Wrap foam with plastic wrap, and aluminum foil with masking tape. [4] X Research source Leave 2 to 5mm between the core and the outline of your anatomical sketch. [5] X Research source You can use straws for the arms and legs. Regular drinking straws will work for yoSD and MSD dolls. Large or \"boba\" drinking straws will work better for SD dolls."

Once it has dried, use a dremel rotary tool or a craft blade to slice the torso and limb pieces along the sides. Cut the head apart along the crown. Remove the core from inside the paper clay shell. [7] X Research source The head will be in 2 separate pieces: a head and head cap. The cut should go around the forehead, above the ears, and the back of the nape. If the eye socket balls remained in the head, be sure to pull those out too. Save the core pieces for casting."

Next, cut the tops of the lower arms and legs off at a slight angle. Do the same for the bottoms of the upper arms and thighs. This will allow the doll to move their arms and knees more freely. The angles need to slant away from the elbows and knees."

Add some clay to the bottoms of the upper arms and thighs, then squish the balls against them to create sockets. [10] X Research source Add some balls to the tops of the upper arms. Make them perpendicular to the arm rather than right on top. This will allow the arms to hang straight down. Make the top of the bottom torso piece taper in a little, then soften the inside edge of the upper torso piece. This allows them to fit together like stacked bowls."

Make the slits run in the following directions: Upper thighs: center-front of the thigh ball. The slit needs to be long enough so that the doll can sit while strung. Knees: back-center of the knee balls Shoulders: inside the arm, where the ball fits into the socket. Elbow: center-front of the inside arm. Feet: across the entire ball, running parallel to the length of the feet. Hands: across the entire ball, from palm to the top of the hand."

You should use a dremel to drill similar holes into your doll's head and head cap so that you can insert magnets. Don't add the magnets yet. You will add them after you cast the doll. A bjd's head will also have a small hole in the bottom where the neck joint is. This hole is the same size as the neck hole. It also has a vertical slit that is wide enough for the elastic and S-hook."

You will need 1 mold box for each piece that you cast, but smaller pieces, like yoSD dolls, hands, and feet can fit into a single mold box. Make the walls taller than the piece when it is laying down on its side. Fill the bottom of each mold box with stone or ceramic clay (not paper clay) to prevent leaks. Don't let the clay dry."

      "content": "Set the pieces into the mold boxes. Press the pieces halfway into the clay. Feet should be placed on their sides, and hands should be placed flat so that all fingers are visible. The head and head cap need to sit flat on the clay. BJDs have seams running down the sides of each piece, so set them into the clay accordingly. Place different sized marbles into the corners of the box. This will allow you to align the mold pieces during casting."

      "content": "Cast the doll in urethane resin. Bjds come in all sizes, shapes, and colors, but there is one thing that they all have in common: they are made from urethane resin. Purchase the resin from a casting supply store, then tint it the color you want using resin dye. If you want the doll to be made from \"French\" resin, purchase a semi-translucent urethane resin. Most dolls are skin-toned, ranging from fair to tan to dark, but some are white. You can also try a fantasy color, such as gray or purple."

Visit some bjd sculpting communities, and research what casting companies are willing to cast bjds. Be aware that casting companies typically have a minimum requirement of 10 dolls. If you are serious about this, consider doing a pre-order. A pre-order is where other people purchase the doll from you. Once the company casts the dolls and ships them to you, you will have to ship the dolls to your customers."

      "content": "Cut and tie round, white elastic for the arms and legs. Measure the distance from the left wrist to the center of the chest, double it, then cut a piece of elastic according to that measurement. Next, measure the doll from the top of the neck to the bottom of the torso, double it, and cut another piece of elastic. Tie both pieces of elastic into loops. The thickness of the elastic depends on the size of the doll and the stringing channels. The bigger your doll is, the thicker the elastic needs to be. Bjds use round (not flat) elastic that is white in color, which you can find in online bjd stores."

Latch it onto the large S-hook, then pull it down through the neck and torso. Pull each half through each leg, then latch it onto the S-hooks too. Use a pipe cleaner or a bjd stringing tool to string your doll. You can find bjd stringing tools in online bjd stores. If you are confused about stringing your bjd, look up video tutorials online or ask a fellow hobbyist to assist you."

Purchase clothing, shoes, eyes, and a wig for your doll from a bjd supply. The wig should fit comfortably over your doll's head, but you will need to insert the eyes using poster tack or silicone ear putty. A faceup refers to the blushing, lip color, lashes, and eyebrows applied to a doll's face. Do not use polymer clay to set the eyes, or you will stain the resin. Be careful what supplies you use for your doll's faceup. Specific brands are recommended for a reason; other brands may melt the resin. If you know how to sew, you can make your doll's clothes yourself. Some people sell bjd patterns, but they may not fit your doll."
