      "content": "Choose a reliable carrier. The first step to ensuring your cat has a safe trip in the car, no matter how long the drive may be, is to buy a sturdy and well-ventilated cat carrier. Your cat cannot safely roam the car, as it could easily get underneath the brake pedal, burrow into the underside of a seat, or even hop out the window. You'll need a carrier that will stand up to travel wear and tear but will also allow your pet to have a constant flow of air to prevent overheating. [1] X Research source A good carrier should be strong, somewhat lightweight, and secure. Avoid cardboard carriers, as these are practically useless. If your cat has an accident inside, the carrier will rapidly deteriorate. You'll want to make sure your cat can comfortably sit or lie down in the crate, but you don't want it so big that your cat will tumble around inside. An ideal carrier opens from the top. This will make it easier to get your cat into the carrier and reach in to feed or pet your cat without allowing for an easy escape. Make sure the carrier is well-ventilated so that your cat does not overheat on the trip. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Make the carrier as comfortable as possible. The hard plastic or wire mesh of a cat carrier isn't particularly comfortable for your cat to spend extended amounts of time on. If you're going on a longer road trip, making the carrier comfortable is even more important to ensure that your cat doesn't get sore or injured. Padding the carrier will also help lock in any accidents your cat might have, ensuring that your car doesn't end up smelling or getting stained. [3] X Research source Put down a layer of newspapers on the floor of the carrier. Then put down a soft towel so your cat will have something comfortable to sit or lie on. The newspaper and towel will help absorb any accidents your cat might have on the trip while also giving your cat some extra padding against the carrier. If you want, you can also put down a plastic liner to help contain accidents. Make sure nothing blocks the flow of air into and out of your cat's carrier. Check the lock on the carrier gate. Make sure your cat will not be able to escape from the carrier unless you open it yourself."

      "title": "Put the carrier in the back seat of your car.",
      "content": "Put the carrier in the back seat of your car. Add some toys in the carrier to make your cat feel less stressed. The best place to situate your cat is in the back seat of your car. If you have some boxes or suitcases you can arrange on either side to stabilize the carrier, that might help give your pet an even sturdier ride. If you don't have anything to put on the sides, you might want to put the carrier on the floor - just make sure that your cat will still get a steady stream of cool air (or warm air, depending on the climate and time of year). Make sure the carrier is in a secure spot in the back seat. That way if you have to stop suddenly, you'll know that your cat will remain safe. [4] X Research source Depending on the size and shape of the carrier, you could even try using a seatbelt in the back seat to strap the carrier securely in place. Once your cat is in the carrier and the carrier placed in the car, do not let your cat out for any reason while you're on the road. A cat roaming freely in your car could easily get stuck under the seat, jump out a window, or cause an accident. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to make the ride as comfortable as possible. Once your cat's carrier is settled in, you'll be ready to hit the road. However, even if the carrier is padded, your cat may still have a frightening ride. You can help make the ride as comfortable as possible by watching the road, paying attention to traffic, and avoiding unpleasant bumps and swerves. [6] X Research source Try to avoid sudden stops/starts, as this can jostle your cat inside the carrier. Avoid potholes and big bumps as best you can. Keep the radio on at a low volume to block out some of the traffic sounds on the road. This can help calm your cat during the drive. Talk to your cat while you drive. If he or she is meowing or yelling, use a soothing tone to reassure your cat that everything is okay."

      "title": "Keep the temperature comfortable inside your car.",
      "content": "Keep the temperature comfortable inside your car. One of the biggest safety hazards to having cats (or any pets) in the car is the risk of extreme weather. It doesn't take much for a car to get hot enough in the summer that an animal could overheat. Even a moderately warm day in the 80 degree Fahrenheit range (26 degrees Celsius) could quickly heat a parked car to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). Having the windows open may not be enough. Because of this, you'll need to take precautions to ensure that your cat does not get exposed to extreme or uncomfortable temperatures. Always keep the air conditioner running in the summer and the heater going in the winter. Never leave your cat unattended in a parked car. If you're traveling with someone, leave the car running with the air conditioning on and take turns going into rest stops so that someone is always with the cat. Remember that high humidity levels can also overheat your pet. Keep an eye on the outside temperature and the humidity level, both where you are and where you'll be traveling to."

      "title": "Try to maintain some shade in the car.",
      "content": "Try to maintain some shade in the car. If your cat's carrier is in direct sunlight, even with the air conditioner going, it can still become dangerously hot for your pet. Try to keep the carrier in the shade if at all possible, but remember to make sure that the carrier's gate is not blocked so that air can still circulate through the carrier. If you do stop anywhere, try to park in the shade. This should be done in addition to having someone stay in the car with the air conditioner on."

      "title": "Consider purchasing a cooling body mat.",
      "content": "Consider purchasing a cooling body mat. If you plan on traveling through extremely hot areas, like a desert, or through extremely humid regions, you may need to take extra precautions. Having the air conditioner on will certainly help, but having a cooling body mat can help give your pet some added protection against the heat and humidity. Cooling mats may rely on a refrigerated component that is inserted into the mat, or they be water-activated. Some cooling body mats stay cool for up to three days while also remaining dry. This can be important when cooling off a cat. You can purchase a cooling body mat at many pet stores, or though an online retailer."

      "title": "Have your cat wear a collar with an ID tag.",
      "content": "Have your cat wear a collar with an ID tag. Even if your cat is an indoor pet, it's a good idea to have your cat wear a collar with an ID tag for the entire trip. That way, on the off chance that your cat manages to escape, it's more likely that someone will find and return your cat if it's clear that the cat has a home. [7] X Research source The ID tag on your cat's collar should have your name and cell phone number. Remember that a landline phone number won't help you if you're on the road. Consider getting your cat microchipped. This can help a veterinarian or animal control worker identify your cat and access your contact information, in case your cat manages to slip off the collar somehow."

      "content": "Get your cat acclimated to car travel before long trips. Traveling in a car can be scary for cats. They often associate being in a car with going to the veterinarian, which is usually an unpleasant trip for cats. Because of this, you'll want to get your cat adjusted to safe, pleasant car rides before taking him or her on a longer road trip. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Go for a series of short drives with your cat. Try to go a few times each week, and start preparing your cat a few weeks in advance. Remember that even the sound of a car engine starting could frighten your cat. Be patient and try to get your cat acclimated well before you plan on making your longer trip. [9] X Research source Try to lengthen the duration of your drive a little longer each time. Aim to add about 15 to 30 minutes every trip."

      "content": "Give your cat a light meal before a long trip. Because riding in a car can be traumatic for cats and may cause them to lose their appetite, it's best to make sure your cat eats before traveling on a long car trip. That way your cat will have enough time to digest the food and use the litter box. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Feed your cat three to four hours before you plan on leaving. Make sure you only give your cat a light meal. Aim for about half of what you would normally feed your cat for breakfast or dinner (depending on when you'll be traveling)."

      "content": "Try to hide the fact that you'll be traveling. If your cat isn't used to car trips, or if your cat has had a traumatic car trip in the past, the sight of your car could set off a panic in your pet. The best way to avoid this problem is by hiding the fact that you'll be traveling from your cat. [12] X Research source Choose a breathable cloth (like mesh) and drape the cloth over your cat's carrier before you carry it out to the car. Once you're inside the car, rearrange the cloth (if possible) so that it allows your cat to see you straight ahead, but surrounds the perimeter of the carrier's gate to block out the sky and the ground."
