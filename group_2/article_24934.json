      "content": "Pull the hair on the crown of your head back with a hair tie. Leave your face framing hair down and pull all the hair on the crown of your head up, leaving your bottoms layers down. Tie it back with a hair tie where you want your ponytail to sit. [1] X Research source Use a hair tie the same color as your own hair for the most subtle look. This small amount of hair acts as an anchor for the rest of your hair."

      "content": "Tease your hair in the ponytail for extra volume. If you’d like to add some height to your ponytail, use a rattail comb to gently back comb the hair nearest the hair tie by combing the hair in the wrong direction back towards your roots. Stick to the top of your ponytail to add volume. [2] X Research source If you have thick hair, you don’t need to add volume to it by back combing."

      "content": "Comb your face-framing layers onto the crown of your head. Use a wide brush to grab the hair around your face and brush it on top of your ponytail. Grab your hair with your hands to keep it in place. [3] X Research source You can pull a few face-framing layers out with your hands if you’d like to keep them loose."

    {
      "title": "Grab your bottom layers and pull them onto your ponytail with a second hair tie.",
      "content": "Grab your bottom layers and pull them onto your ponytail with a second hair tie. Keep 1 hand in place holding your face-framing layers onto the ponytail. Reach down with your other hand and pull your bottom layers up onto the ponytail. Wrap a second hair tie around all of your hair with the small ponytail in the middle. [4] X Research source You can use a brush to grab your bottom layers if you need to. Plastic cord hair ties give the most hold without leaving creases in your hair."

      "content": "Fluff your ponytails together with your hands to merge them. Flatten out any lumps in your ponytail and make sure the center hair tie is covered. Brush your ponytail if you need to smooth it out more. [5] X Research source Use a thin layer of hairspray to keep down any flyaways around your face or neck."

Grab 2 bobby pins and insert them vertically into your ponytail through the hair tie. [7] X Research source Use bobby pins close to your hair color to make them blend in more. Adding bobby pins props up your ponytail and makes it stand up taller."

Gently scrunch your ponytail from the bottom up to give it some volume and hide the bobby pins. [8] X Research source Even if your hair isn’t super thick, the base of your ponytail is thick enough to hide the bobby pins. Spray a thin layer of hairspray to smooth down any flyaways around your face."
