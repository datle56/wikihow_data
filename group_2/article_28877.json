Medium to high ponytails generally look the best if you are going for a fun look. A low bun typically looks more professional.

      "content": "Leave the bun overnight. You will want the hair to dry completely while it is in the bun so that the curls will remain after you have removed it. Leaving the hair overnight will ensure that they can have ample time to dry. Remove the bun in the morning. Carefully undo the bun, leaving it in the ponytail. Your hair should be cute, curly, and ready to go with minimal effort!"

      "title": "Start with dry hair.",
      "content": "Start with dry hair. You can wash your hair and then blow dry it completely or let it air dry and then style after a few hours. Pour a dime-sized amount of mousse into your palm and rub it between your hands for about 5 seconds. Run it through your hair and then use a brush to distribute the product more evenly. Mousse will give your hair texture and will help set the curls with the curling iron. [4] X Research source Some mousse products contain heat protectants that will prevent the curling iron from damaging your hair. If your mousse doesn't have this, spray a separate heat protectant product on your hair."

      "title": "Curl your hair.",
      "content": "Curl your hair. Use a large-barrel curling iron between one and two inches in diameter to curl the ends of your hair. A larger curling iron will give you loose waves and a smaller curling iron will give you tighter curls. Plug in the curling iron and allow it to heat up. Once the iron is hot, wrap a section of your hair around the barrel. Hold for ten to fifteen seconds. Release the section of hair. Comb through the curls with your fingers. This will loosen the curls and make them look a bit more natural. Wait until the hair has cooled before doing this so that you donâ€™t ruin the curl. The curl will need a minute or two to set after the heat has been applied. Curl your hair again if necessary for extra curls."

The night before styling your hair, wash and dry your tresses with shampoo as you normally do but spray with a leave-in conditioner while it is damp instead of conditioning.

      "content": "Use the rollers. Roll hair into the smallest sponge rollers you can find. The small rollers will give you tight curls. Unclip the roller. Gather a section of the ponytail and place the roller behind the section of hair. Slide the roller from the roots of the section of hair to the tips. Tuck the ends under the roller and twist both the roller and your section of hair towards the scalp. Secure the roller with the clip. If you prefer looser curls or waves, use rollers that are larger in diameter. Place a bun net over the rollers. This protects them from getting caught on things and can protect the curls. Bun nets can be purchased from any drug store. Keep rollers in overnight. This will give the curl ample time to set so that they will last longer the next day."
