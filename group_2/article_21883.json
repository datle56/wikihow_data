      "content": "Personalize your celebration based on your wife’s unique preferences. Many people think that an anniversary calls for a candlelit dinner at a restaurant, but matchmaker and dating coach Michelle Jacoby explains that anniversaries aren’t one-size-fits-all. Instead of opting for a generic plan, she recommends thinking about your wife’s specific likes and desires, and using that knowledge to come up with a unique experience. “There’s a gazillion different ways you could celebrate,” she says. For example, if your wife is a die-hard fan of a band, take her to a concert. If she loves the outdoors, take her on a hike to a beautiful location to have a picnic. Or, if she’s more of a homebody, set up a cozy movie night at home, complete with her favorite snacks and a projector screen. Whatever you think your wife would enjoy the most!"

Or, revisit the location of your first kiss, or the place you first said “I love you” to each other. An anniversary is a chance to reflect on the beautiful memories you've shared together, and these types of nostalgic experiences are perfect for that!"

      "content": "Get her a gift she’ll love. To choose a thoughtful anniversary gift for your wife, start by brainstorming about her personality and interests. For example, if she’s a hopeless romantic, consider getting her sentimental gift like a piece of jewelry engraved with the date of your anniversary, or a high-quality photo book with all your best pictures together. Or, if she’s the kind of person who prefers sharing experiences rather than receiving material gifts, you could buy a couples massage at a luxury spa, or a hotel room for a weekend getaway at a fun location. There are also traditional gifts for each year of marriage that you may want to consider. You definitely don't have to adhere to this list, but it can help inspire you: First anniversary: Paper Fifth anniversary: Wood 10th anniversary: Aluminum/tin 15th anniversary: Crystal 20th anniversary: China 25th anniversary: Silver 30th anniversary: Pearls 40th anniversary: Ruby 50th anniversary: Gold 60th anniversary: Diamond [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Write her a long-form love letter. A brief anniversary message in a card can be a heartwarming gesture, but if you really want to make your wife feel special, consider writing her a long, old-fashioned love letter . This is an especially good idea If your wife is a romantic or sentimental person—she’ll definitely cherish this thoughtful token of your love! Here are some tips: Start by brainstorming all the things you love about your wife. What do you find most charming about her personality? What things does she do that you truly appreciate? What do you think is the most beautiful thing about her? This will help you go more in depth in your letter. After you’ve brainstormed, write a rough draft of your love letter. This allows you to express your feelings freely, without worrying about things like grammar or formatting. You can edit and polish later when you’re writing your final draft. If possible, write your letter by hand, rather than typing it out. A long, handwritten letter tends to come across as a bit more meaningful and romantic than a typed one. Be vulnerable, and speak from the heart. Your love letter is a chance to tell your wife how much she truly means to you, so don’t be afraid to go deep! [2] X Research source"
