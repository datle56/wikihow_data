      "content": "Use products to help with sexual dysfunction. Postmenopausal women have lower levels of the hormone estrogen, which in turn decreases vaginal lubrication and elasticity (stretchiness). This can make arousal more challenging and the friction of sex uncomfortable. Often dryness can be conquered with a water-based lubricant. If needed, your doctor can prescribe estrogen creams or hormone replacement. Men may experience impotence or have more difficulty getting and keeping erections. If non-medical methods fail, there are numerous products like Viagra that can assist. Impotence is more common in men who have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes, which affect circulation. Some studies suggest that the supplement ginkgo biloba can improve impotence because it increases circulation, but others show no such effect. Check with your doctor before taking any herbal supplements."
