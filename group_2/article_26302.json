      "title": "Get enough sleep.",
      "content": "Get enough sleep. Sleep is arguably the most important part of looking fresh. After all, when people are thinking about freshness, the first thing they think of is probably someone who is at the start of their day following a long and fruitful rest. People who sleep at least 8 hours per night actually feel more attractive, and they tend to look it too. Prolonged sleep deprivation comes with a laundry list of negative traits, not least of which includes dark eye circles and a bloodshot complexion. If you find yourself having trouble getting to sleep at a normal time, try making a point of going to sleep at the same time each night. It may be tough to adjust to at first, but your body will eventually fall into the habit of tiring out at that time. Oversleeping isn't usually as big of a risk for people, but it is something you'll want to be mindful of. If you oversleep, you'll feel just as groggy as you would without sleep, but you'll have also lost precious morning hours while you're at it. Reader Poll: We asked 158 wikiHow readers and 93% of them agreed that itâ€™s important to take time for yourself . [Take Poll] Making time to take care of your body (and mind) is part of that!"

      "content": "Wash your hair regularly. Freshness has a large part to do with the way your hair looks. Greasy hair doesn't make for a good look on anybody. Though rinsing your hair in the shower each morning is recommended and feels good, you may not need to use shampoo as often as you think. Everyone's hair has its own set of needs, so rather than sticking to a single strict guideline, it's best to listen to your body's indicators and do what seems best. [1] X Research source The amount you shampoo your hair should depend in part on your lifestyle choices, most specifically how physically active you are. The more physically active, the more often you should clean your hair. Overwashing with shampoos is a bad idea as well. Although no one will ever hold a value on hygiene against you, you can inadvertently remove healthy natural oils out of your hair (and skin!) by overdoing it on the hair cleaners."

      "content": "Eat well. Eating well is something everyone knows they should do, so it is lamentable that few follow through with it. Nonetheless, it should be made a priority if you want a fresher look. A healthy diet is manifest in virtually every part of your body, from the hair to the skin and everything internal. [2] X Research source Although each person's diet should be custom-tailored to match the needs of their body, there are probably some things you eat regularly you know you could do without. Cutting out 'empty calories' (like soda) and replacing them with healthy alternatives will transform your appearance by itself in as little time as a month. Eating well has a considerable effect on your mood as well as your appearance. Being in a chipper spirit will make others perceive you as fresher than they normally would otherwise.

If your hands and feet are looking weary, taking them for a gentle, thorough treatment will improve the look in a potentially big way.

If your budget is a concern, give yourself manicures at home! You may not get the perfect look, but you'll save a lot of money in the long run. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Curl your lashes. When you're feeling tired, the first thing that suffers are your eyes. With that in mind, looking fresh with makeup has a lot to do with making your eyes look more alert. As lashes frame the eyes, curling them upwards can open them up wide. Use an eyelash curler and hold it up for five seconds. [7] X Research source You can achieve a similar effect with curling mascara or false lashes. You should only curl your upper lashes. The lower lashes are too short to curl effectively."

While eyeshadow is less versatile for given events and situations than an easy eyeliner or mascara, it's still something you might want to look into if you're wanting to get the freshest look.

Use a powder brush to apply it to the areas of your face that receive the most sunlight: the nose bridge, forehead, chin, and cheekbones. [9] X Research source This is typically a part of the contouring routine, but if you leave off the shadow, you'll get a simple, fresh-faced look. A light dusting across your face will let light pick up on your face more effectively, which in turn will have a freshening effect on the way you look."

Giving things a 'sniff test' doesn't always cut it. Instead, you've got to put different regulations on different pieces of clothing. [10] X Research source For example, in the case of jeans and most pants, you can wear them over the course of several days before they begin to lose their stretchiness. Tops should be laundered much more frequently however, as natural body odour is most concentrated from the torso upwards. If you're prone to sweat or body odour, washing your bedsheets as often as once per week is a good idea. Pillows and comforters can be done a few times a year. [11] X Research source"

Staying up to date can make you look contemporary and hip, and it's relatively easy to stay up to date. Subscribe to some hot fashion magazines, or take a trip to the mall to see what styles are getting showcased.

It should go without saying that one natural body type is no better or worse than any other. [13] X Research source Rather, it's the way you work with it that counts. At the same time, don't let yourself get tied down by your body type. Your fashion sense should be liberated if anything, and if you think you can pull off a certain outfit in spite of what the guidelines say, you absolutely should."

If you've got your chin up and your head invested in whatever you're involved with currently, people are bound to perceive you far differently than if you're looking glum and hate the world. Of course, it's never enough simply to want to be in a good mood. Knowing how to bring out the best side of yourself is crucial. Be mindful of the way you're feeling, and don't be afraid to laugh. [14] X Research source If you're in a good mood, you'll have a positive impact on the way others feel when they're around you. Laughter is the easiest way to improve your mood. If no one's around to make you laugh, read a comic or watch a comedy. Seeing the lighter side of life can have a transformative impact on the way you feel for the rest of the week.
