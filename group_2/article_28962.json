      "content": "Scan the front and the back of an ID. You can either use your own ID and change the text, or you can use someone else’s ID and change the image so long as their measurements, hair, and eye color are a match. Regardless of which option you choose, you need to scan the ID using a scanner . Scan the back of the ID as well to ensure that the barcode on the back will match the ID on the front. [1] X Research source The barcode on the back is encoded with the information on the front. Even if you’re changing the text, you still want it to show the same state, license number, and unmodified information. It is easier to change a photo than to change the text."

      "content": "Open the front of your ID with an image-editing program like Photoshop . If you don’t know or have an image-editing program like Photoshop, GIMP, or Photoscape, you can use an online image editor like Sumo Paint or Paint.NET. Open the image in your program of choice to adjust the ID. [2] X Research source You can find Sumo Paint at https://sumo.app and Paint.NET at https://www.getpaint.net/ . Both of these online programs are free to use."

      "content": "Paste a new photo over the current ID’s image if you scanned someone else’s ID. Open the photo that you’re going to use to replace the current photo. Trim the photo so that it is a similar size to the original ID’s photo. Export the new photo to a separate file and then open it in the same project as the scanned ID. Drag it on top of the original photo until you’re happy with the location. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can put the new photo over the location where the photo belongs on the ID and the cut the sides of the image off with the crop tool in whatever program you’re using. Hold the shift key down in Microsoft programs while dragging the corner of a photo to keep the ratio between the sides of the image identical to the original photo. If your new photo won’t go in front of the ID, right click it and find the layers tab. Select “bring it to the front” or “front” to make it lay on top of the ID. If you need to take a new photo specifically for your new ID, use a camera and a tripod to take it. Try to duplicate the background on the original ID by hanging a drape or bedsheet of the same color behind you."

      "content": "Identify the font used in the ID by searching online and comparing to change your ID. If you scanned your personal ID and want to change the text, you need to start by figuring out what typeface your font uses. You can look online to see if the info for your state or department is available or you can simply open the ID next to a list of commonly-used fonts and compare them. [4] X Research source Courier, with slab serif, is used on a lot of older licenses. A lot of newer driver’s licenses use Arial—or some slightly-modified version of it."

      "title": "Cover type by copying and pasting the background over old text.",
      "content": "Cover type by copying and pasting the background over old text. Use the clone tool or “clone stamp” to cover any letters or numbers that you want to change. Zoom in on the ID and copy the blank piece of background right next to the letter or number you’re changing. Move the copied piece of background over the letter and number and place it to make it seem like it was never there in the first place. Place a text box over any letters or numbers that you need to replace before typing in new values. [5] X Research source You can zoom in and modify the text that already exists instead of replacing it. For example, you can turn an 8 into a 6 by clone stamping the upper section of an 8 on the right. Similarly, you can turn a 6 into an 8 by cloning the bottom right of the lower loop and pasting it into the opening. If you plan on changing entire lines of text, the end result is going to look really bad. Try to modify as few of the text fields as possible since the clone tools in editing programs will only work on a smaller scale with the complicated backgrounds of most IDs. Check the base of any new text you enter to ensure that it lines up with the other characters on the ID."

If the details don’t match the photo though, you may not have much of a choice. Change the hair color, eye color, and height to match the person that plans on using the ID. If you’re just using the ID for novelty purposes, you don’t need to worry about changing these details. [6] X Research source Enter a full name, without abbreviations. The only instance in which you might use an abbreviation is for things like \"Albert Smith Jr.\" or \"Thomas Jones III.\" Use a realistic birth date. Don’t leave the birth date as 1951 if you look 20 years old."

Print the front and the back of your ID on the same cardstock. Cut them out with scissors or a utility knife and straight edge. The weight of cardstock refers to how heavy 500 sheets of a particular type of paper is. 130 is probably the heaviest that you can print at home on a standard printer. You can use a paper cutter if you have one. This will result in cleaner lines, but they may fray along the edges depending on the style of cardstock you use. [7] X Research source"

Carefully press the 2 halves together and smooth each side out by pinching it between your fingers and sliding them to the edge while starting from the center. Place the ID under a heavy object to flatten it as it dries. [8] X Research source Leave your ID for 4-8 hours before touching it again."

Let it cool for 5-10 minutes before touching it. Once you’ve removed it and trimmed the excess laminate, you’ve got a fake ID. [9] X Research source Depending on the make and model of your laminator, you may need to let it warm up for a few minutes before using it. If the temperature is too high, the glue in between the 2 layers of cardstock will melt. Trim the laminate with a pair of scissors or a utility knife. It should be really easy to get a clean cut when trimming the laminate since it’s so thin."

Teslin paper is a good substitute and will closely resemble the feel of a government ID after you laminate and trim the final product. A lot of medium- and high-end laser printers have the capacity to print on Teslin paper, but the quality may be low if you try to use a printer that doesn’t have manual controls for the print settings."

[10] X Research source You can use regular laminate pouches if you want, but butterfly laminates come with a crease that reduces the odds of air bubbles forming on your ID. Since air bubbles are one of the biggest tip-offs that an ID is fake, you really need to use a butterfly pouch. Get a laminate pouch with a holographic exterior to make your ID look authentic. You won’t be able to find identical patterns unless you buy some illegally or download the template on the deep web."

[11] X Research source The most popular torrent-hosting site is https://torrentfreak.com/ . To digitally edit a real ID, you’ll need to use the duplicate/stamp clone tool and erase every single line of unique text. Some templates are form-fillable, meaning that you can simply type each line of text into the template and print it that way."

Use three-point lighting to replicate the look of professional photos by setting up three light sources with 2 on either side of your camera and 1 above you. Set your camera on a tripod and use the self-timer to take your portrait. [12] X Research source Don’t take your photo on a phone. Even if the picture looks good, the resolution is probably wrong for an ID card. Use a high-quality camera on a low shutter speed to take the photo."

Check your state’s ID to see if there are restriction and endorsement codes. If there are, write the endorsement code as “P,” for passenger vehicle, since this is the most common endorsement. The restriction code is usually either “A” or left intentionally blank for a regular driver. [16] X Research source Other common restriction codes include “B” for people that wear corrective lenses or glasses, and “R” for motorcycles. If either of these apply to you, change the endorsement code."

Try to match the thickness of your line to the thickness of a real signature. Select black for the color of your line and use your mouse to carefully draw your signature. It may take multiple attempts before you get a signature that works. [17] X Research source It can be kind of tough to free-hand a signature with the mouse. Feel free to redo it until you get a signature that matches your real one. On a lot of fake IDs, the signature is a dead giveaway that it’s not authentic. Do your best to get the thickness of the lines to match by adjusting the size of your brush in the editing software. Keep in mind that the signature on IDs will never extend beyond the allotted borders for it on a real ID. Use the erase tool to trim any sections that go past the box for your signature."

Place the protective paper that came with the pouch on top of the butterfly pouch. [19] X Research source The butterfly pouch is just a folded sheet of laminate. The crease at the top is the side you enter into the laminator first. This ensures that no air bubbles get trapped in the laminate."
