The invitation will read \"You're invited!\" and will have a huge button labeled Try now (if on a stable release) or Update now (if you are on a beta release). The beta invitation is sent out randomly and to already existing beta testers. If you do not get the invitation when others get it, then hope to get the invitation again in the future.
