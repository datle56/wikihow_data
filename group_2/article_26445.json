You can lose anywhere from 1–3 pounds per week by cutting out 500–750 calories each day. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source With this plan, you should be able to lose about 10 pounds in two weeks. It's not advisable to cut out more than 750 calories daily or eat fewer than 1200 calories daily. It's too difficult to consume enough essential nutrients with a diet that is overly restricted. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Restricting calories any more will not speed up weight loss. Remember that weight loss needs to happen gradually and healthfully. You can find a relatively accurate calorie counter online which can guide you on how many calories you currently consume and how many you can cut from your diet."

However, limiting these foods has been shown to help support quicker weight loss. [7] X Research source While carbohydrates can be included when there is more time allotted for weight loss, it is essential to cut carbohydrates when trying to lose weight fast. Whole grains are grains that are minimally processed and contain all the nutrient-dense parts of the grain (the germ, bran, and endosperm). These types of grains are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you choose have grains, try to choose 100% whole grains like: quinoa, oats, 100% whole wheat pasta or brown rice. Refined carbohydrates are generally very processed and low in nutrients (like fiber). [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Limit the following types of foods: bread, rice, pasta, bagels, crackers, pretzels, chips, muffins, tortillas, or quinoa. You can choose to cut out these foods altogether or allow 1–2 servings daily. You may notice quicker weight loss with fewer servings of these carbohydrate rich foods. If choosing to include grains, choose 100% whole grain options when you can. Whole grains are much higher in fiber and other nutrients compared to refined grains.

However, many times these diets are unhealthy, unsafe, and not sustainable for long periods of time. In addition, you're more likely to gain your weight back. [14] X Research source Avoid diets that ban entire groups of foods or encourage you to eat very, very small portions or a diet that is less than 1200 calories daily. [15] X Research source Also avoid diets that promote using liquids or \"cleanses\" as these can cause adverse health effects. Also be wary of diets that encourage the use of supplements or diet pills to help induce quick weight loss. Again, these are most likely not safe and will not cause long-term weight loss.

Vigorous intensity aerobic exercises are activities that raise your heart rate and breathing pace very high. You shouldn't be able to say more than a few words at one time. Moderate intensity cardio also increases your heart rate and breathing level, however you should be able to say short sentences with ease. Examples of vigorous exercise might include: running, spin classes, high intensity interval training, or boxing. Examples of moderate intensity exercise might include: walking/jogging, dancing, or using the elliptical machine. If you can, spend more time doing aerobic exercises each week. You can help speed up your weight loss with additional activity. Try HIIT training, which consists of intervals of high and low intensity, is a great way to lose weight quickly as it is very good at promoting fat loss. Be careful of high amounts or very high intensity workouts with a low-calorie diet. You need to eat enough to support your exercise. That's why it's important to never go below 1,200 calories daily — especially when you're working out."

To maintain that weight loss you have to continue with a healthy, well-balanced diet. That means indulging in favorite foods, but only doing so occasionally. An indulgence can be anything — a sweet treat, a dinner out or two alcoholic beverages at a happy hour. These should only be occurring every so often — maybe 1–2 times a week. However, you should define what occasionally means for you. If these types of treats are popping up more often, you're more likely to gain some of your weight back. When you do know that you'll be indulging, try to compensate in other areas of your diet or lifestyle. Perhaps you spend more time at the gym or do a harder workout or eat lighter throughout the day."
