      "content": "Break up the hours into 5- or 10-minute blocks. Use the blocks to alternate back and forth between fully focusing on a task or activity and working at a more relaxed pace.

Transport your mind to a different time and place to pass the time. Engrossing yourself in a good book helps keep your mind fully occupied, and you likely won’t even notice the hours fly by.

      "content": "Put together a to-do list for your future. Channel your boredom into a productive task by jotting down goals or dreams that you have. Open up a digital note or grab a piece of paper and a pen. Then, come up with goals for today, the end of the week, and the end of the month. You can also think about tasks you need to complete to make those goals happen. In the end, you'll have a solid game plan you can use to improve your future. [5] X Research source Life coach Jessica Elliot advises to approach your goals in small, incremental steps. By doing a few things every day, you're adding to your overall larger goal. Take your time when approaching your goals. Slow things down, take it day-by-day, and understand that there's beauty hidden in the journey."

Clear out your fridge and wipe down the counters to get your kitchen tidied up. You could also do some of that laundry that’s been piling up or organize your garage. Get to those less-than-desirable tasks, and you’ll pass the time and feel accomplished when you’re finished.

      "content": "Use this simple trick to make time go by faster. Instead of counting the time, start counting from 100 to 1. As you count, you won’t notice the time passing, and counting down can feel like you’re reaching a goal. Mix it up and force your mind to focus by counting down by 2s, 5s, or something tricky like 7s. You could even count from 1000 to 1 to take up more time. [7] X Research source Counting up can make it feel like you’re counting the seconds, which could actually make it seem like time is passing more slowly. So, always aim to count down."

[9] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source You could also head to the gym to get a really good workout in. Exercise releases endorphins that can make you feel happier and more relaxed, and while you’re focusing on exercising, you won’t think about the time as much. You don’t necessarily have to exercise, but some time outside can help boost your mood. If you can’t exercise outside, working out or relaxing indoors can also kill some time."
