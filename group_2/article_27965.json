      "content": "Heat a pan of water. You only need a little water, about ½ cup (120mL). Heat the water until it just begins to bubble. Kids should ask an adult for help handling the hot water. Distilled water gives the best results, but tap water should work fine.

      "title": "Choose your salt.",
      "content": "Choose your salt. There are many kinds of salts. Each one will grow into a different shape of crystal. Try these and see what happens: Table salt takes a few days to grow. \"Iodized\" salt won't work as well, but will still form crystals. [2] X Research source Epsom salt grows into smaller, needle-like crystals, but grows more quickly than table salt. Buy it at a pharmacy. Alum grow quickly, sometimes making visible crystals within a few hours. Find it in the spice section of a grocery store."

      "title": "Stir in as much salt as you can.",
      "content": "Stir in as much salt as you can. Take the pan off the heat. Pour in about ¼–½ cup (60–120mL) of your salt and stir until the water is clear. If you don't see any salt grains in the water, stir in another spoonful. Keep stirring in more salt until you see salt grains that won't dissolve when you stir. You've just made a supersaturated solution . This means the solution (the liquid) contains more salt than water can usually hold! When you heated the solution (your water), the molecules sped up, creating space between them that allowed more of the solute (your salt) to be absorbed than usual."

      "title": "Pour the water into a clean jar.",
      "content": "Pour the water into a clean jar. Carefully pour the hot water into a jar or another clear, heat-safe container. This should be as clean as possible, so nothing interferes with the crystal growth. Pour slowly and stop before the salt grains fall into the jar. If there are undissolved salt grains in the jar, the crystals might grow around those grains instead of your string. Since supersaturated solutions are very unstable, salt will come out of the solution when you disturb it. This means it will start to form crystals, which takes heat away from your solution.

      "content": "Add food coloring (optional). A couple drops of food coloring will change the color of your crystals. It might make the crystals smaller or more lumpy as well, but usually not by much."

      "title": "Tie a string around a pencil.",
      "content": "Tie a string around a pencil. The pencil should be long enough to lie across the top of the jar. You can use a popsicle stick or small stick instead. The tiny grooves and rough edges of the string provide a place for salt to latch on and grow. [4] X Research source A fishing line won't work, since it's too smooth."

    {
      "title": "Cut the string the correct size to dangle in the water.",
      "content": "Cut the string the correct size to dangle in the water. Only the part of the string underneath the water will grow crystals. Cut it short enough to avoid touching the base of the jar, or the crystals might end up lumpy and small."

    {
      "title": "Balance the pencil on top of the glass jar.",
      "content": "Balance the pencil on top of the glass jar. The string should hang inside the jar, extending into the water. If the pencil won't stay still, tape it against the jar. Try not to have the string touch the side of the jar. This can make smaller, lumpier crystals grow against the side."

      "title": "Move the jar to a safe place.",
      "content": "Move the jar to a safe place. Keep the container where animals and young children can't get to it. Here are some tips for choosing a location: To grow a lumpy mass of crystals quickly, keep the jar in the sun and/or keep a fan blowing near it on the lowest setting. These crystals may stop growing at a fairly small size. If you want a single, large crystal instead of a clump of crystals, keep the jar in a cool, shaded place. [5] X Research source Keep it on a Styrofoam pad or similar material to absorb vibrations. [6] X Research source (There's still a good chance you'll end up with a clump, but there should be larger individual crystals within it.) Epsom salt (and a few less common salts) will grow faster in the refrigerator instead of the sun."

    {
      "title": "Wait for crystals to form.",
      "content": "Wait for crystals to form. Check back regularly to see if salt crystals have grown on the string. Epsom salt or alum crystals can start growing within a few hours, but might take a couple days. Table salt usually takes a day or two to get started, and sometimes up to a week. Once you see little crystals on the string, those will usually keep growing bigger and bigger over the next couple weeks. When the water cools, it has way more salt than cold water can normally hold. This makes it very unstable, so the dissolved salt will leave the water and grab onto the string if it gets a tiny push. [7] X Research source As the water evaporates, the salt stays behind, making it even more unstable and encouraging the crystal to grow. This is because the crystal is in a lower energy state, which makes it more stable than the salt was in the solution."

      "title": "Grow a cupful of salt crystals.",
      "content": "Grow a cupful of salt crystals. Follow the instructions for the easy method, but use distilled water and do not use a string or pencil. Just leave the salt water in the container. Over the next few days, a layer of small crystals will grow over the base of the container. Use a flat, shallow, wide container instead of a jar. This makes it easy to get a single crystal that hasn't merged with any others. [8] X Research source Epsom salts do not work well for this method. Try alum or table salt instead, or see variations below for more ideas."

      "title": "Choose a seed crystal.",
      "content": "Choose a seed crystal. Once the crystals are ready, pour out the liquid and look at the crystals. Pick them up and examine them with a pair of tweezers. Select a \"seed crystal\" that will form the core of your new, larger one. Look for crystals that fit this description (from most to least important): Choose a lone crystal, not in contact with any others. Choose a crystal with flat, even surfaces and straight edges. Choose a large crystal (at least the size of a pea). [9] X Research source Ideally, find several crystals and set each one up in a separate jar as described below. Crystals often dissolve or fail to grow, so having backups is a good idea."

      "title": "Attach fishing line or smooth wire.",
      "content": "Attach fishing line or smooth wire. Super glue this to one side of the crystal, or tie it around the crystal. Do not use string or rough wire. You need a smooth surface so the crystals can't grow on the string instead of the crystal."

      "title": "Create a new solution.",
      "content": "Create a new solution. Select distilled water and the same type of salt. This time, warm the water only slightly above room temperature. The goal is to make a perfectly saturated solution. An under-saturated solution may dissolve your crystal, while an over-saturated solution will cover the crystal in salt grains and cause a lumpy mass to grow. [10] X Research source There are several faster ways to solve this problem, but they are more difficult and may require some knowledge of chemistry. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Add the crystal and solution to a clean container. Clean a jar, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water. Pour the new solution into this jar, then hang the crystal into the center. Store it as follows: Place the jar in a cool, dark location, such as in a low cupboard. Keep it on a Styrofoam pad or other material that absorbs vibration. Keep a coffee filter, paper, or thin cloth over the jar to block dust. Do not use an airtight seal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check on the crystal regularly.",
      "content": "Check on the crystal regularly. The crystal will grow more slowly this time, since a little water will need to evaporate before the salt grains are forced to attach to the crystal. If everything works out, the crystal will keep the same shape as it grows. You can take it out whenever you like, but it will most likely keep growing for several weeks. About every two weeks, pour the solution through a coffee filter to remove impurities. [12] X Research source This is a difficult process. Even experienced crystal growers sometimes have a crystal dissolve or become lumpy. If you have a perfect seed crystal, you might want to test a worse seed crystal first to make sure the solution works out."

      "content": "Create a crystal garden. Instead of making a single crystal, why not create a cupful? Make your salt solution, then pour over cut up sponges or charcoal briquettes in the base of the container. Stir in a little vinegar, and watch crystal formations grow overnight. Pour enough to saturate the sponges without submerging them. To make different colors of crystals, add a drop of food coloring to each sponge."
