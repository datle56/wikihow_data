It has been proven effective as a method of birth control for males and the vasectomy is usually an outpatient procedure, using only a localized anesthetic. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Vasectomies are considered permanent. Although some may be reversible, there are no guarantees. Some people save a sample of sperm in case they would like to fertilize an egg in the future. Make sure you understand that you will likely never have children in the future after your vasectomy. Vasectomies have a low risk of complications. You will still need to practice safe and protected sex, as a vasectomy will not protect you against any sexually transmitted infections. Full recovery takes, on average, a week.

      "content": "Understand the details of the procedure. The main vasectomy technique in use today is known as “percutaneous no-scalpel vasectomy”. All vasectomy procedures will target the same area, tubes known as the vas deferens. These tubes will be located, exposed, cut, tied, and then secured inside the scrotum to heal. You can expect the entire procedure to take around thirty minutes. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your doctor will first apply a localized anaesthetic. This will numb the area and eliminate any pain. The vas deferens are then located by your doctor. This is a simple step which your doctor is able to find the vas deferens simply by feeling for them. A small and specialized tool is used next to make a hole in the skin of the scrotum. This hole will allow your doctor to access the vas deferens directly. The vas deferens, once exposed, will be cut and then tied. By cutting and tying these tubes, sperm are prevented from leaving the body, eliminating the chances of reproducing. Modern techniques cause very little bleeding and no stitches should be required."

Although you can get a reversal, the success rate is only about 50%, and reversals aren't covered by insurance.

Although modern vasectomy techniques cause minimal discomfort, there are some things you can do to speed along the healing process. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you develop a fever or signs of infection, seek medical help immediately. Support the scrotum, either using a bandage or supportive underwear, for 48 hours. Keep the area cool by using ice packs for the first 48 hours. This helps reduce swelling or inflammation. Avoid physical activity for at least one day after the surgery. Too much activity can cause injury and bleeding in the scrotum. Avoid bathing or swimming for, at minimum, one day after the surgery. Avoid heavy lifting for seven days. You can return to work after 1-2 days if you have a desk job, but if your job is more physical in nature, it's best to take several days off before you return.

      "content": "Wait seven days to have sex. [10] X Expert Source Robert Dhir, MD Board Certified Urologist & Urological Surgeon Expert Interview. 12 October 2020. If you engage in sexual intercourse before a week has passed, you may notice pain and blood in your ejaculate. You also still may have viable sperm in your semen, which can result in pregnancy. Because the tubes still have sperm in them a man needs to ejaculate 20 time before birth control is effective. Continue use of birth control until your doctor has confirmed that your vasectomy has been successful. Follow up includes a sperm count 3-4 months after the procedure to check and see how many sperm the man has in his sample. The couple can then stop short term birth control. The vasectomy can sometimes be reversed, but this does not always work."
