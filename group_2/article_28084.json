      "title": "Share some personal details with them.",
      "content": "Share some personal details with them. The number one way to get someone to think about you is to tell them something personal and unique about you. You don't have to give them your whole life story or sensitive details like your address. Instead, drop tidbits or anecdotes about your passions, ambitions, challenges, or your cultural heritage. This will help them feel like you value them, which could in turn increase their trust and interest in you. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a little mystery to keep them wanting more.",
      "content": "Create a little mystery to keep them wanting more. While sharing personal information is a great idea, don't play all the cards in your hand in one date! Keep some details in reserve, so that they have to spend more time with you to find out all your secrets. This will make you seem a little more mysterious and unique than other people they've dated in the past. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look your best when you're around them.",
      "content": "Look your best when you're around them. If you want to make a good, lasting impression on someone, make sure you look your best whenever you know you're going to see them. This tip is particularly effective when you're dating a man since, according to Pompey, \"guys are very visual.\" But it works the other way around, too! Women are more likely to think highly of a man who grooms himself well and dresses neatly. Putting effort into your appearance will help you stand out in all kinds of situations, from dates to job interviews to conferences."

    {
      "title": "Wear a scent that will remind them of you when they smell it.",
      "content": "Wear a scent that will remind them of you when they smell it. Whenever you smell something, the olfactory bulb in your brain sends a signal to the limbic system. That part of your brain houses the amygdala and the hippocampus, which scientists believe are responsible for emotions and memories. [3] X Research source This is why it's a great psychological strategy to wear a scent when you're around someone you want to remember you. Whenever they smell that scent, no matter where they are or who they're with, they'll immediately think of you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk about your favorite movies and music.",
      "content": "Talk about your favorite movies and music. Mentioning your favorite media will help the other person associate you with it whenever they come across it. For example, let's say your favorite movie is Jurassic Park and your favorite band is Metallica . When you tell them that, anytime they see that movie on TV or hear Metallica songs on the radio, there you are in their thoughts! [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give them their space and avoid being clingy.",
      "content": "Give them their space and avoid being clingy. As much as you like the other person, you may make them want to forget you if you reach out too often or bombard them with questions. According to Pompey, \"you don't want to become too overbearing or too clingy.\" You may, for example, want to wait a few days or a week before going on a second date . By holding back, you're giving them the space to want to think about you rather than feel like you're forcing them to do so by constantly bothering them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid responding too quickly to texts.",
      "content": "Avoid responding too quickly to texts. This can be a tough tip to follow when so much of modern dating revolves around SMS and DMs. So, Pompey advises, start by \"texting a little bit here and there and every now and then.\" Respond to a text \"a few hours later, just to give them a chance to miss you and wonder\" where you are. Play a little bit hard to get without resorting to mind games. To do that, says Pompey, \"[C]reate a little bit of chase so that they don't feel like you're always there and they have you anytime they want you.\" This will make you irresistible!"

    {
      "title": "Stay active on social media (and make sure they can see your posts).",
      "content": "Stay active on social media (and make sure they can see your posts). To keep yourself at the top of their mind, leverage the power of Facebook, Instagram, X, or TikTok. First, follow their account and make sure they can follow you back. You can even make it easy for them by setting your account to public, so they don't have to do the extra work of sending a friend request. Next, post regularly about yourself, your life, and your interests. That way, they can't help but see you whenever they scroll their timeline. Only post once a day or every other day. Otherwise, you might give them the impression that you live for social media, which could make you look superficial."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start new traditions with them.",
      "content": "Start new traditions with them. A tradition is repeating the same thing with the same person under a specific set of circumstances. For example, you might start a tradition where you get ice cream at your favorite sweet shop after every date. Or you might see a movie on the same Saturday every month. Set up a regular activity you both enjoy, so that when the time for it approaches, the other person will think of you and look forward to your shared ritual."

      "title": "Put a unique spin on common dating questions.",
      "content": "Put a unique spin on common dating questions. When you've been dating for a long time, it's sometimes challenging to set yourself apart from the pack and spark the other person's interest. Instead of sticking to the same old cliche questions, like \"What do you do for work?\" or \"What's your sign?\", Pompey suggests asking your date fun questions with a unique spin. For example, you can ask, \"What's your dream job?\" or \"What's your most controversial take on a popular food?\" These questions initiate discussions and debates that help you learn about each other's personalities. That's more memorable than knowing which zodiac sign you were born under! Avoid treating your date (especially the first one) like you're going on a job interview and grilling them with a lot of serious questions. A better approach, Pompey says, is to \"keep it fun, keep it light, be playful, [and] be different.\""

    {
      "title": "Show your passion for life.",
      "content": "Show your passion for life. Talk to the person you want to think about you about the things in life that excite you. This shows them that you love life and that you have a soul. For example, if you enjoy nature, talk about how you like to walk or hike and what you find beautiful about the great outdoors. If you love reading, gush about your favorite books and authors. Whatever you're passionate about, let that shine through and give the other person food for thought."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adopt an easygoing attitude.",
      "content": "Adopt an easygoing attitude. Avoid being difficult or demanding when you're with the other person. That's a big turnoff and may make them want to forget you instead of thinking about you! Instead, be easygoing and flexible, and take small setbacks and mistakes in stride. They'll admire how calmly you handle yourself and think back later on how chill they felt talking to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Show that you can have fun and joke around.",
      "content": "Show that you can have fun and joke around. Life isn't always serious, and most people want someone who's fun as well as dependable. To show that you can hang with the best of them, suggest or be open to cool dating ideas, like playing mini-golf or axe-throwing. Laugh at the other person's one-liners (if they're funny), and don't be afraid to throw out a few jokes yourself. If you can make them laugh, that's even better! [5] X Research source Then they're sure to think about you and what a good time they had."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay open-minded.",
      "content": "Stay open-minded. Being open-minded to ideas, concepts, and experiences different from your own is attractive, according to Pompey. It shows you're not so set in your ways that you can't try new things or respect other people's lifestyles and beliefs. That doesn't mean you should be open to doing things that cross your personal boundaries or violate your ethics. But if you want someone to think about you, they may feel more inclined to remember you if they know you're willing to meet them halfway."
    },
    {
      "title": "Express your opinions and respect theirs.",
      "content": "Express your opinions and respect theirs. Being able to say what you really think and feel is a sign of confidence, which is always a turn-on! [6] X Research source At the same time, though, remember to respect the other person's opinion, even if it's different from yours. Use your similarities and differences to have meaningful conversations that they won't be able to stop thinking about when you're apart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Show kindness and empathy to other people.",
      "content": "Show kindness and empathy to other people. We tend to judge a person's character by how they treat others. If you're dating someone, for example, you might judge them by how they handle conflict with their family, whether they're a positive influence on their friends, and how they behave in private. [7] X Research source You can be certain the person you want to think about you is silently assessing you in the same way. So don't be afraid to be a little vulnerable and show qualities like kindness and empathy . Show them you're a good person who's worth thinking about."

    {
      "title": "Ask your mutual friends to talk about you.",
      "content": "Ask your mutual friends to talk about you. If you and the person you're interested in have mutual friends, ask them to mention you in that person's presence. [8] X Research source They can gauge their reaction when your name is dropped and gather intel on any feelings they may have for you. If you haven't moved to the dating stage yet, your mutual friend might even be willing to suggest they give you their number. Only use this tip if you know your mutual friends don't mind helping you spark a relationship. Avoid asking them to ask the other person out for you or putting them in any other situation where they feel awkward."

      "title": "Define your goals for manifesting someone to think about you.",
      "content": "Define your goals for manifesting someone to think about you. What is your purpose in getting the other person to think about you? Not only that, but how do you want them to think about you? If you're in love with someone, you may want them to think about you romantically or sexually. If you're pursuing a job offer, you may want the recruiter to think of you as the perfect candidate. That's why McVey suggests focusing on a goal. Make sure it's \"believable,\" so that when you manifest it, you'll believe it's possible. A believable goal might be, \"I want this person to think about me as a potential life partner.\" A less realistic goal would be, \"I want this person to think I'm rich and sexy like Angelina Jolie.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the current date and your manifestations in a journal.",
      "content": "Write the current date and your manifestations in a journal. First, note what day it is. Follow that with a clear title or heading that sets your intention (i.e., \"Making [name of person] Think About Me\"). Finally, list the goals and desires you intend to manifest. Be extremely specific about how and when you want the manifestation to occur. This is important because, according to McVey, \"the more specific you are, the better because then it [the universe] knows exactly what you want.\" McVey also suggests writing in the present tense (i.e, \"I want\" instead of \"I wanted\"). The manifestation will happen \"depending on your mind and your timeframe,\" so keeping your focus in the moment could help it take place sooner."

    {
      "title": "Take actions that will make your manifestations happen.",
      "content": "Take actions that will make your manifestations happen. Manifesting isn't just about putting a desire out into the universe and then sitting back to watch it happen. It's about bringing that energy into your life through action. [9] X Research source You don't need to move mountains, but you should still work toward your goal. For example, to get someone to think about you, send them a casual text to remind them you exist. You might also arrange to bump into them at their workplace or at a party with mutual friends."

    {
      "title": "Recite or write positive affirmations to reinforce your intention.",
      "content": "Recite or write positive affirmations to reinforce your intention. As you pursue your goals with action, use positive affirmations to keep your intention on task. Say or write things like, \"I am willing [person's name] to think about me\" or \"I believe [person's name] is thinking about me right now.\" Choose a similar mantra and repeat it whenever you feel like you're losing focus or confidence in your manifestation. Making positive affirmations about yourself in relation to the other person can be effective, too. For example, you can say, \"I am worthy of being loved by [person's name]\" or \"I am kind, passionate, and driven like [person's name].\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Check off each manifestation as it happens.",
      "content": "Check off each manifestation as it happens. After writing down your list of manifestations, check your journal periodically to see if anything on your list has occurred yet. Every time one of your goals is achieved, McVey says, \"check it off.\" If a manifestation still hasn't come true, leave it on the list and keep waiting. Sometimes, manifestations take longer than we want, even if we specify a timeframe. The more manifestations you create, the easier it will be for you to create more in the future. This is because, according to McVey, \"the more excited you get about what you created, the better you'll be at creating it.\""

      "title": "Clear your mind with deep breathing.",
      "content": "Clear your mind with deep breathing. If you want to send a spiritual message to someone else, you can't be distracted by all the different thoughts racing around in your mind. To clear your thoughts and become a better conduit for telepathic communication, take some deep breaths. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Put your hand on your stomach and feel your abdomen rise and fall. Repeat this deep breathing technique as long as it takes to help your mind settle. [10] X Research source Telepathy is when you communicate with someone using your thoughts instead of spoken words or gestures. Some people say that if your mind is clear and your will is strong, anyone can send telepathic messages to another person."

      "content": "Visualize the person you want to send a message to. Think hard about the person you want to think about you. [11] X Research source Don't just focus on their name or what they look like. Imagine what it's like to be in their presence: how they sound, how they smell, what their touch feels like, and how they sit or stand or walk. If you have trouble visualizing the other person, look at a photo of them. Study every aspect of it and memorize it. Then, when you close your eyes, try to see that photo in your imagination."

      "title": "Feel the other person's presence.",
      "content": "Feel the other person's presence. As soon as you're able to visualize the other person in your mind, put yourself in their shoes. What are they feeling? What mood are they in? What emotions might they be feeling in this moment? For example, they may be naturally bubbly, outgoing, smiling, or they may be quiet, withdrawn, and stoic. Allow yourself to embrace those feelings, too, so that you feel more at one with them. [12] X Research source This step helps you get on the same spiritual plane or energy frequency as the other person, making it easier to send and receive messages."

Now that you're connected to the other person and how they're feeling, imagine you're them, going through the process of thinking about you. You might, for example, imagine opening the Spotify app and seeing a song you said you liked come up on their playlist. Then, in your mind's eye, you see them thinking of you and smiling. You see them wondering how you are and feel their longing for you. Feel every emotion you want them to feel to create thoughts of you in their mind. [13] X Research source"

Or, the next time they see you, they might say, \"I've been thinking about you.\" Keep in mind that this is a subtle form of communication. You may need to do it more than once to align your energies and get the message across."

Ways to do that include sharing personal details, leaving a little bit to the imagination, looking your best around them, and talking about your favorite movies and music. You can also make them miss you by not being too clingy and waiting a few minutes or hours to respond to their texts. If these psychological tips don't work, try manifesting them thinking about you or sending them thoughts or feelings using spiritual telepathy."
