Then, use a large spoon or spatula to mix the ingredients until they are well combined. [2] X Research source Choose a scented hand soap for scented slime! You can also opt for a colored hand soap to add a tint to your slime, but you will likely still need food coloring to make the color noticeable. Choose any food coloring you like for your slime, such as yellow, green, blue, or red! You can also combine 1 drop of 2 colors to make a different color, such as 1 drop of yellow and 1 drop of red to make orange slime, or 1 drop of red and 1 drop of blue for purple slime.
