      "content": "Born between August 19-25, this cusp is passionate and driven. The Leo-Virgo cusp is called the Cusp of Exposure, and people born under this cusp are bright, courageous, and energetic. When Leo’s fiery ambition and passion meet Virgo’s thoughtful, well-spoken intellect, the result is a combination of natural leadership skills, creativity, and lots of charm. Leo-Virgo cusps know how to excel in life and make a splash wherever they go! If your birthday falls within the Leo-Virgo cusp, it means you were born during the time of year when the sun moves from Leo to Virgo—and, as such, your personality is likely influenced by both signs. Leo is a bold, confident fire sign ruled by the Sun, which is the planet of ego, drive, and pride. Meanwhile, Virgo is a practical, meticulous earth sign ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication. Famous Leo-Virgo cusps include Tori Amos, Kim Cattrall, Kobe Bryant, Sean Connery, John Stamos, Bill Clinton, Ray Bradbury, Wilt Chamberlain, and Kenny Rogers."

      "title": "Passionate and expressive",
      "content": "Passionate and expressive Leo-Virgo cusps are influenced by the bold, energetic Sun (which rules Leo) and communication-oriented Mercury (which rules Virgo). As a result, these cusps are courageous, unafraid to express themselves, and keen to chase their passions because of Leo’s influence, as well as intelligent and well-spoken from Virgo’s influence. [1] X Research source They’re bright and quick to act but can also process and think over the smallest details of a situation. Sometimes, Leo-Virgo cusps may feel conflicted; Leo encourages them to embrace bold, decisive actions, and Virgo encourages them to think things through before making a move. If you’re a Leo-Virgo cusp, try to find a balance between those two sides of yourself. Take some time to think through big decisions, but when you’re done, don’t be afraid to embrace your inner Leo and take the plunge."

      "title": "Benevolent",
      "content": "Benevolent Leos are known for their friendliness and generosity, and Virgos always love to pitch in and help.

      "title": "Loyal",
      "content": "Loyal Leos are fixed signs, or the “stabilizers” of the zodiac, meaning they’re driven, tenacious, and very loyal. Meanwhile, Virgos are earth signs, meaning they’re naturally very reliable and dependable as well and always come through for friends and family. Leo-Virgo cusps draw traits from both Leo and Virgo—and as such, they have Leo’s protective loyalty and Virgo’s dependability. Leo-Virgo cusps are especially protective of the people who show them the same amount of love and care in return. Once their loyalty is earned, it never wavers."

      "title": "Ambitious",
      "content": "Ambitious Leo and Virgo are both ambitious, but their ambition manifests differently. Virgo is diligent, hardworking, and humble, content to plug away until they’ve excelled past their peers. Leo, meanwhile, takes pride in their work and isn’t afraid to show off a little because they love being the center of attention. [3] X Research source Therefore, a Leo-Virgo cusp will have the ambition, drive, showmanship, and hardworking instincts of both signs. Virgo is associated with the 6th house in astrology , which governs routines and work. Leo is associated with the 5th house , which governs romance, creativity, and passion projects. That’s why Leo-Virgo cusps tend to be able to strike a healthy balance between work and home life. They understand that working and playing hard are related; it’s important to do both!"

      "title": "Health-conscious",
      "content": "Health-conscious Cleanliness and hygiene are important to a conscientious Virgo, especially because the 6th house in astrology also rules health, healthy routines, and self-care. Meanwhile, Leo loves to look their best and impress everyone with their regal appearance at all times, so Leo-Virgo cusps are often pretty health-conscious and dedicated to looking after themselves both physically and mentally. For example, these cusps are likely to prioritize vital aspects of a healthy lifestyle like eating well and staying physically fit. They’re also not above pampering themselves by practicing self-care. Similarly, Leo-Virgo cusps also tend to be fairly neat and prefer to make their surroundings very visually appealing. They love beauty and order."

      "title": "Critical",
      "content": "Critical Leo-Virgo cusps have perfectionistic tendencies, and while that’s not inherently a bad thing, it can also make them overly critical of both themselves and others. [4] X Research source Leos are regal and want only the best, while Virgos are extremely detail-oriented and selective. That means Leo-Virgo cusps have high expectations of almost everything in life and may criticize or demean things that seem less than perfect to them. Tip: Imperfection is natural. If you’re a Leo-Virgo cusp, you don’t need to hold yourself or your loved ones to an impossible standard. Try to relax a little , be patient, and understand that it’s okay to make mistakes here and there."

    {
      "title": "Stubborn",
      "content": "Stubborn Leos are fixed signs, and while that “stabilizer” energy makes them loyal, it also makes them royally set in their ways. Meanwhile, Virgo’s earth sign influence makes them prefer routine to spontaneity, so Leo-Virgo cusps tend to be fairly stubborn. These cusps like things done a certain way and prefer not to be challenged (and, since they’re also perfectionists, they tend to feel their way is the best way). Tip: Virgo is a mutable sign, meaning they’re a little more open to change and flexibility. If you’re a Leo-Virgo cusp, lean on those Virgo influences and compromise with people instead of digging your heels in all the time."

    {
      "title": "Controlling",
      "content": "Controlling Leo’s commanding energy and Virgo’s perfectionism also make this cusp keen to control every project or group activity they get involved in. Leo-Virgo cusps know what they want and aren’t afraid to express it. They’re smart, observant, and very capable, but that also means they may become a bit controlling and overbearing or start correcting other people when they think they know best. Tip: If you’re a Leo-Virgo cusp, remember to be tactful when expressing your opinions and avoid correcting people just to show off. Your ideas are valuable, but it’s just as important to be humble and kind in order to work well with others."
