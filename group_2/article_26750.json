To the two sides of the tee body, you should attach the pipe plugs or door. You could install a sight window on one side instead of a second pipe plug, if desired. At the bottom of the tee body, you should connect a ball valve using a 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) reduction bushing. To the top of the body, screw on, in order: 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) reduction bushing, 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) nipple fitting, and 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) cross."

Do not use pipe fittings made of brass or carbon steels, and do not use any part rated for lower than 2000 psi."

This can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour. You could also pour the sol into syringes with no needles or tops. That way, you can remove the finished gel by pushing it out with the plunger. TMOS is the source of the silica in this method. The water allows the TMOS to polymerize, and the methanol lets both the water and TMOS enter into the same phase so that they can react. The ammonium hydroxide lets the reaction go faster."
