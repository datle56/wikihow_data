      "content": "Heat up 1-1/2\" of oil in a large frying pan until 375°F. If you don't have a candy thermometer, keep everything on medium-low, and you'll be ready just as small amounts of \"smoke\" is rising from the top of the oil. If you drop a small test ball of dough in, the oil should immediately start bubbling. A thick-bottomed pan is always your best bet, as they hold heat much better than thinner pans. You can also wait to pre-heat the oil until after you've made the dough. However, this can take some time, so starting now is a good idea if you think you can do the dough quickly. If you do, just keep the burner on medium, not high, to prevent burning. [1] X Research source"

There are a lot of ways to turn your ball of dough into long, delicious churros, and none of them are wrong. Use whatever works for you, making long, thin, cylindrical treats: Pinch and Roll: The simplest method, simply pull off a 2\" ball of dough and roll it between your hands to form a snake-like shape, roughly 1/2\" thick. Decorative Piper: Usually used for icing, these have star-shaped tips that will get the ridges found on fairground churros. Pack the dough where the icing goes and then push it through to make perfect, even logs of dough. [4] X Research source DIY Decorative Piper: Take a large freezer back and fill it with dough. Then cut the bottom corner off the bag to form a small opening. Squeeze the dough through this whole to make your logs. [5] X Research source"

The total cooking time will depend on how thick the churros are, but you should be able to tell easily when they are done, as the outsides will be an alluring golden brown. Don't put more than 3-4 churros in the pan at once -- too much will drop the temperature of the oil rapidly, leading to greasy churros."

The dough in a \"real\" churro is a little different than the dough in a biscuit, but the basic ingredients are the same and they will cook similarly. It is usually best to use the smaller biscuits, allowing you to more easily fry everything. If you don't want the fat of biscuit batter, you can use 1 cup hot water and 3-1/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose pancake mix. Blend into a dough and proceed like normal. [7] X Research source"

There should be enough oil so that they float freely while frying, and all sides, except the very top, are being cooked at the same time. If you don't have an oil thermometer, 375 is when there is barely smoke coming off the top of the oil. Don't let it get much farther than this point."
