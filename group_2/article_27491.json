      "title": "Obtain some packaged Jell-O.",
      "content": "Obtain some packaged Jell-O. You can get these very cheap at places such as Walmart, Target, Safeway, or your local grocery store. You may have some at home already. If you need to buy some, check it out in the frozen foods aisle. For a rainbow effect and variety of different flavors, have several different kinds. Perhaps some cherry, lime, and grape mixes."

    {
      "title": "Set up your work space.",
      "content": "Set up your work space. Although not much room is needed for this task, when working in the kitchen and getting a bit messy, it's always easier for you to tidy up in the beginning than for you to clean up what looks like tornado wreckage afterwards. After setting aside a few things, let the fun commence!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the Jell-O drinks.",
      "content": "Make the Jell-O drinks. This way is for those who want a single flavour per glass. Carefully open the package to ensure spills aren't made and begin to pour the contents into a large glass - or glasses if you've decided to make multiple. How much you put in is another question, but you really don't need too much. Start with a little, and if doesn't look like enough, add some more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill your cup(s) with water.",
      "content": "Fill your cup(s) with water. Filtered water is usually best, although it really doesn't matter. Some folks even boil their water first, but this only firms the jello when you add ice. If that's what you're going for, go right ahead and do that."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix it up well.",
      "content": "Mix it up well. The little bitty contents of the jello will linger around for a bit, so it's best to mix them for a minute or two."
    },
    {
      "title": "Garnish!",
      "content": "Garnish! Garnish however you please. Maybe put some whipped cream on top or put some sprinkles on top. Or, for a refreshing serenade, add some ice and lemon. Throw a fruity umbrella in there and you're set for the beach."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use several small containers.",
      "content": "Use several small containers. This is for all you rainbow/science lovers out there and is also really fun to do with the kids. Put in the same amount of water in each one, preferably exact. Around four centimeters (~1.5 inches) should do it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a tablespoon and take a large amount of any chosen flavour.",
      "content": "Take a tablespoon and take a large amount of any chosen flavour. For white/clear color, use sugar for this part. This is the bottom layer. Put in the most jello powder in one container and mix."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do the same thing as in previous step, decreasing the amount of powder in each one.",
      "content": "Do the same thing as in previous step, decreasing the amount of powder in each one. This is decreasing the fluids amount (or mass, you science lover). The less on the top, most on the bottom. It is best not to put dark colours with each other, but you can if you would like to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a small baster from your kitchen, and suck up the first container, with the largest batch.",
      "content": "Take a small baster from your kitchen, and suck up the first container, with the largest batch. Carefully, along the edge of the glass and close to the bottom, allow it to slowly drip until the baster is empty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat.",
      "content": "Repeat. Do this with all of the other containers, slowly and carefully. You might want to save up most of the jello, as this is extremely frustrating. But the end result is indeed worth the wait. Your jello drink will have the colours stacked on top of the others; at least until you drink it. If your last two colors are dark ones, such as blue and purple, maybe add a white sugared layer in between to show of the vibrant layers. And don't fuss over it. In the end it's just a drink and a cool, and of course yummy, science experiment!"

    {
      "title": "Add your own style.",
      "content": "Add your own style. Whipped cream and lemon slices look good, great for summers. It is advised you do not add ice to this variation though, your hard work would mix together."
