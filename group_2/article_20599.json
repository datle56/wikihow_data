Be aware that the best location for you might not necessarily be the one that is geographically closest to you, as some locations may lack certain specialties. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The Rochester, Minnesota campus is the flagship Mayo Clinic institution, offering the widest variety of services from the largest number of physicians. Due to the typically cold, harsh winter weather conditions, the Rochester, Minnesota campus is less likely to be busy than the other two during the winter season; this may mean a shorter waiting period."

You may be able to see a doctor more quickly if you are a \"walk-in\" patient; these waiting times can still take a week or more (depending on how many people cancel and the severity of your illness). Don't wait to receive medical attention if you are seriously ill. If your condition worsens while you are waiting, see your doctor and request a referral to Mayo if you haven't already been given one. This could \"fast-track\" your appointment."

Before you attempt to schedule an appointment with Mayo Clinic, you should speak to your doctor and ask whether specialized care is needed for your condition. Mayo Clinic physicians are highly regarded as some of the best in the world but are typically specialists in various fields of medicine. Your condition may be better handled by a general practitioner. Ask first whether you think you may need to see a specialist for your condition. If your doctor says 'yes,' then you can ask her whether Mayo Clinic might be a good choice for you. Alternatively, you can do your own research to figure this out."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your primary care doctor is probably in a better position than you to make this assessment; it is always best to consult a doctor before making serious decisions about your healthcare.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Though most patients are able to schedule their appointments themselves, some insurance companies require that you receive a physician's referral before they will agree to cover your treatment at Mayo Clinic. Contact your insurance company to find out their policy. Even if your insurance company does not require that you receive a referral, some specialty areas within May Clinic might. This is why it is important to contact Mayo Clinic before scheduling an appointment."
