      "content": "Reduce stress in your life. Stress and anxiety may contribute to the conditions causing your eosinophilia. Taking some time to relax may help you regulate your eosinophil levels. Examine your daily routine for common causes of stress. Where possible, eliminate or reduce your contact with stressful triggers.

      "content": "Reduce your exposure to any known allergens. Allergies are the most common cause of a high eosinophil count. Your body may be producing more eosinophils in reaction to the allergen. Treating your allergies and avoiding triggers can help you manage eosinophils in your body. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Hay fever can cause eosinophil levels to surge. Treat your hay fever with over-the-counter antihistamines like Benadryl or Claritin to reduce the eosinophil count in your body. For example, if you’re allergic to dogs, try to avoid contact with dogs whenever possible. When visiting friends with dogs, ask them if they can put the dog in another room during your visit."

      "content": "Keep your home clean. Dust mites can irritate some people and cause a reaction that may increase eosinophils, especially if you have a dust mite allergy. To avoid this, keep your home as clean as possible. Dust at least once a week to prevent dust mites from building up in the corners of your home. [3] X Research source Pollen can have a similar effect on some people. To prevent pollen from coming into your home, keep your doors and windows shut during high pollen seasons."

      "content": "Eat a healthy diet low in acidic foods. Heartburn and acid reflux can both increase the eosinophil count in your body. Eating a balanced, healthy diet is essential to preventing these conditions. Look for foods low in fat, such as lean meats, whole grains, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Avoid acidic foods, such as fried foods, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onions, and coffee.

      "content": "Quit smoking and minimize how much alcohol you drink. Quitting smoking can help you have healthier levels of eosinophils. While there is no different evidence of the correlation between reducing alcohol and eosinophils levels, doing so will certainly make you healthier in general.

      "content": "Increase your daily Vitamin D intake. People with low vitamin D levels are more likely to have high eosinophil counts. [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source There are two ways you can increase your Vitamin D intake. Go out into the sun for between 5 minutes (for people with very light complexions) and 30 minutes (for people with darker complexions) at least twice a week. Alternatively, you can take a Vitamin D3 supplement. [7] X Research source To get Vitamin D from sun exposure, be outside. Vitamin D comes from UVB rays, which don't penetrate glass, so sitting by a sunny window won't help. Cloud cover reduces rays, so spend a little more time outside on cloudy days."

      "content": "Use turmeric to reduce inflammation in combination with medications. Turmeric (also known as curcumin) may be able to reduce eosinophils in certain situations. To get the anti-inflammatory benefits from turmeric, you should get higher dose capsules of turmeric. Keep in mind that turmeric is quite expensive, so it might not be the best option.

      "content": "Visit your doctor for a full examination. Many conditions could cause your eosinophilia, including a blood disorder, allergies, digestive disorder, connective tissue disorders, parasites, or a fungal infection. Your doctor will take blood and skin samples to help find the cause. In rare cases, they may also order stool tests, CT scans, or bone marrow tests. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Primary eosinophilia is when you have high eosinophils in your blood or tissue caused by a blood disorder or disease, such as leukemia. Secondary eosinophilia is caused by a medical condition other than a blood disorder, such as asthma, GERD, or eczema. Hypereosinophilia is a high eosinophil count without any apparent cause. If your eosinophilia is affecting a certain part of your body, you may be diagnosed with a specific type of eosinophilia. Esophageal eosinophilia affects your esophagus while eosinophilic asthma affects your lungs."

      "content": "Visit an allergist to get tested for allergies. Since allergies often increase eosinophils, your doctor may refer you to an allergist. The allergist may do a patch test, in which they place small amounts of common allergens on your skin to see if you react. They might also take a blood sample and test it for allergies. [11] X Research source If the allergist suspects you have food allergies, they may place you on an elimination diet. You will stop eating certain types of foods and introduce them back into your diet one at a time. An allergist will perform blood tests to determine if certain foods affect your eosinophil levels.

      "content": "Take a corticosteroid medication. Corticosteroids are currently the only medication used to treat a high eosinophil count directly. Steroids can reduce inflammation caused by high eosinophils. Depending on the cause of your eosinophilia, your doctor may give you a prescription for a pill or inhaler. Prednisone is the most common corticosteroid prescribed for eosinophilia. Always follow your doctor’s instructions for taking medications. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your doctor is unsure of the cause of your eosinophilia, you may be given a low dose of corticosteroids to start. They will then monitor your condition to see if it improves. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not take a corticosteroid if you have a parasitic or fungal infection. Steroids could make the condition worse. If you’re taking oral prednisone, never abruptly stop taking it if you’ve been on it for more than 3 weeks. You need to have your prescription gradually lowered. If your doctor prescribed a topical high-potency steroid, don’t use it for more than 2 weeks at a time."

Parasitic infections come with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gas/bloating, fatigue, or unexplained weight loss. To help get rid of parasites and return your eosinophil levels to normal, your doctor will give you a medication designed to kill your specific parasite. Your doctor will not prescribe a corticosteroid, as steroids can worsen some parasite infections. [15] X Research source Treatments for parasites can vary widely based on what is infecting you. In many cases, your doctor will prescribe a pill that must be taken daily."

      "content": "Get a prescription for acid reflux if you have esophageal eosinophilia. Your eosinophilia may be caused by acid reflux, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or another digestive disorder. To confirm that you have esophageal eosinophilia, your doctor will give you tests such as an EGD scope, which is a scope that goes into your esophagus, and a biopsy. Your doctor may prescribe a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), such as Nexium or Prevacid, to treat the condition. [16] X Research source Esophageal eosinophilia does not lead to an increased risk for esophageal cancer.
