      "title": "Fold the bill in half from top to bottom, then unfold.",
      "content": "Fold the bill in half from top to bottom, then unfold. Before you start, position your one-dollar bill so George Washington’s face is visible and upright. Lift up the long bottom edge of the bill and join it with the top edge. Press down to form a horizontal crease at the halfway point of the bill. Unfold the bill once your crease is made. [1] X Research source To make crisp folds, origamist and contemporary artist Coco Sato says you can use your fingertip or nails to go over your creases. Use a bone folder , a ruler , or the non-sharp edge of a butter-knife to help your folds appear extra crisp."

    {
      "title": "Fold the top and bottom edges to the middle crease.",
      "content": "Fold the top and bottom edges to the middle crease. First, lift the bottom edge up so the edge meets the crease you just made. Repeat with the top edge so the top and bottom edges are touching in the center of the bill, right at the central crease. [2] X Research source When you complete this step, you can’t see George Washington’s picture anymore."

      "title": "Turn the bill upside-down and unfold the upper flap.",
      "content": "Turn the bill upside-down and unfold the upper flap. When you rotate the bill upside-down, the words “One Dollar” are readable. Unfold this flap, revealing George Washington’s chin. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the bottom edge toward the middle crease. Take the already folded lower edge of the bill and bring it up to the middle crease, revealing the “In God We Trust” inscription. Crease it, taking care to make the fold neat. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Accordian-fold the rest of the bill.",
      "content": "Accordian-fold the rest of the bill. An accordion fold is when you make equal creases that stack on top of each other, folding in alternating directions. The folds resemble the bellows of an accordion. [5] X Research source Start by picking the bill up from the bottom and turning it over so it’s face-down, with the “ONE” in the center of the bill upright and readable. [6] X Research source Fold the top edge down so the thin rectangle with “In God We Trust” is facing you and readable. Flip the bill over so the “In God We Trust” inscription is at the bottom. Fold the bottom edge upward to reveal the inscription and crease it. Repeat about two to three more times, flipping and folding until the entire bill is folded behind the “In God We Trust” inscription."

    {
      "title": "Crease the sides of the bill at the swirls.",
      "content": "Crease the sides of the bill at the swirls. First, hold the bill, which is now a skinny rectangle, so you can read the “In God We Trust” inscription. Find the two swirls above the inscription on each side. Right next to those swirls, fold each side of the rectangle backward behind the bill, one at a time. Pinch to crease, then unfold the sides once the creases are set. [7] X Research source Fold so the swirls are still visible—make the creases right next to where the swirl starts on each side. At the end of this step, unfold so you’re holding the skinny rectangle again."

    {
      "title": "Fold the right side at the crease and at the “We.”",
      "content": "Fold the right side at the crease and at the “We.” On the “Trust” side of “In God We Trust,” fold the right side of the bill backward at the crease you just made. Pinch it with your finger and thumb so your thumb is covering the word “Trust.” With your other hand, grab the right side and twist it to create a new fold so it’s pointing upward above with the word “We.” [8] X Research source The twist fold at the “We” doesn’t fold into the bill, but outward. In other words, you’re not twisting and tucking the side into itself, but twisting outward toward the right."

    {
      "title": "Do a reverse fold at the last crease you made.",
      "content": "Do a reverse fold at the last crease you made. You’re essentially turning the twist fold at the “We” inside out. Open the flap that’s pointing upward so you see the eagle and coat of arms that looks like a shield. Close the flap the reverse way so the coat of arms is on the outside of the flap now. Crease it as the last crease you made, pointing upward above “We” again. [9] X Research source This is the almost-finished top of the cross."

      "title": "Fold the top of the cross down and tuck it in.",

Fold the top of the cross you just made almost halfway down, so the white border is just covering the inscription but not touching the bottom edge.

      "content": "Turn the bill over, pinch it, and fold the free side down. Flip it over so the inscription is face down. Fold the free right side toward the left at the crease by the swirl that you made earlier. Pinch it with your thumb and pointer finger at the right edge of the top part of the cross. Bring the long end back toward the right and fold it downward so it lines up with the top half of the cross. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Do a reverse fold along the crease you made last. Undo the fold at the crease by the swirl so you can manipulate the downward fold. Open up the accordion flap so the bright-green treasury seal is visible. [12] X Research source Re-fold the flap in the reverse direction—the green seal is now exposed at the bottom corner of the reverse fold. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the bottom of the cross back to the center. Again, fold it backward at the swirl crease so it lines up with the top half of the cross behind the word “We.” [14] X Research source Your cross is now complete! Adjust as necessary to make it as straight and lined-up as possible. To prevent the bottom half of the cross from unfolding, place it between the pages of a book and put something heavy on top of the book. After a few hours, check on the cross—it should be flat and hold together on its own. [15] X Research source Alternatively, use a small dot of craft glue to hold the bottom of the cross in place."

Lift up the short right edge of the bill and line it up with the left edge, creasing at the center of the bill (the middle of Washington’s face). Press down to make a crisp crease. Unfold. [16] X Research source Choose a dollar bill as crisp as possible—a wrinkled one will be harder to fold neatly."

Press the rectangle all the way down. To create even points on both sides of the heart, push the inner parts of the rectangle outward and upward like you’re creating a little bowtie. [26] X Research source If the back creases are messy, that’s okay—no one has to see that side! Once the top of the heart is properly creased, your dollar heart with a cross design is complete. The cross is formed by the white borders of the bill."
