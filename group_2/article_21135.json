      "content": "Balance your chest hair with your facial hair. Always keep your overall aesthetic in mind when grooming your chest. If you wear a long, scruffy beard, a clean-shaven chest looks out of place. Similarly, shorter chest hair looks better on men with short or no facial hair. Look your best by keeping your hair in proportion. [1] X Research source You can look in a mirror to gauge this. Get your hair styled first, then trim your chest hair to match it. Your head and body should look like they belong together."

      "title": "Match your chest hair with your other body hair.",
      "content": "Match your chest hair with your other body hair. Also take into account the hair on your arms and legs. Having a swimmer’s bare chest with hairy arms and legs can look strange. Wear your chest hair a little longer to match those other spots. Think about how dark and thick the hair is on those spots before trimming your chest, and use a large mirror to check your work. [2] X Research source Of course, you can also trim your leg and arm hair using clippers. This usually isn’t done unless you have a lot of hair in those areas. Don’t forget to proportion your chest to your stomach, too. Groom your stomach while you take care of your chest. Keep the hair the same length."

      "content": "Trim your hair shorter to show more of your body. Consider your overall appearance before trimming your hair short.

      "content": "Separate your chest and neck by removing upper hairs. To make your chest look better, shave off the hairs on or touching your neck. This area is noticeable to most people looking at your face. Removing these hairs shows attention to detail and makes you appear more neatly groomed as a result."

      "title": "Put on a shirt to check your hair.",
      "content": "Put on a shirt to check your hair. Slip on your favorite shirt and take a look in the mirror. If the fabric bunches up uncomfortably around your chest, that can be a sign to cut the hair shorter. Double-check that stray hairs stay wangled under the sleeves and collar. Target those areas and trim the hair as needed to appear neatly groomed. [4] X Research source Put on a work shirt if you have one. Stay hairs can be a faux pas in a formal environment."

      "content": "Go hairless for sports and aesthetic reasons. Many guys get the idea that body hair is wrong. You don’t have to look like the cover of a romance novel. Unless you truly want to be hairless or need to do it to stay aerodynamic while swimming laps, reign in your expectations. The people around you aren’t grossed out by body hair the way you may think. [5] X Research source Body hair is natural and looks natural. Avoid trying to be someone you’re not. What’s important is finding out what looks and feels right for you."

      "content": "Use hair clippers on the longest guard setting. For maintaining chest hair, invest in a good pair of hair clippers. These come with different size settings that make grooming easy. Start with the longest guard attachment in your set. This will be labeled with a high number such as 8, which means it will leave your hair long. [6] X Research source There are some clippers marketed as body groomers. You can get this kind of electric trimmer or use the same kind of hair clippers you would use on your head."

Slowly drag the blade down to the bottom end of your chest. Start back at the top again to work on another section. Continue doing this until you reach all of the hair. [7] X Research source It doesn’t matter if you start in the middle of your chest or the sides. Let personal preference be your guide. For tricky areas, such as around your collarbone and nipples, slow down. Move the blade downwards until you reach the area, then go around it. Reposition the blade as needed to reach any missed hairs."

      "title": "Change to a shorter-length guard.",
      "content": "Change to a shorter-length guard. If you want shorter chest hair, switch guards. The guard you use depends on how short you want the hair. A #8 guard leaves hair 1 in (2.5 cm) long, while a #5 guard leaves it 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) long. If you are unsure, start at the higher settings and work your way down. [8] X Research source As you get into a grooming routine, you gain a better understanding of which guard is the right choice for your situation."

      "content": "Trim difficult patches with scissors. Some spots on your chest may still look long. Comb these out by dragging a fine-toothed comb up your chest. Then snip the hair to length using the scissors. It is hard to get every hair the same length across your chest, so work slowly and measure these tough spots out by eye. [9] X Research source Body trimmers often come with shaping attachments that make this easier. You could also use nose hair trimmers."

      "content": "Repeat trimming once a week. After your chest looks perfect, it’s up to you to maintain it. Approximately once a week, go back and groom it again. Use the lower guard setting to trim the hair back down to a shorter length. Otherwise, a comb and scissors are more than enough for a quick touch-up. Experiment with your grooming routine! Hair grows back, so the consequences from a mistake are temporary."
