      "content": "Choose an eyebrow pencil and powder that is similar to your natural coloring. If you still have one of your eyebrows, this might be a little easier--just match the pencil to the shade of your eyebrow hair. Otherwise, use your hair color as a guide. If you are a brunette or a redhead, look for a color that is one shade lighter than your hair. If you are a blonde, try one shade darker. [1] X Research source You can't substitute eyeliner for an eyebrow pencil in this case. You are literally drawing on your eyebrow, and eyeliner is too likely to smudge and ruin the illusion. Use the same method to choose powder, but don't get too matchy--if the colors are a little different, it will add more dimension to your drawn-on brow. Feel free to mix brow powders or eyeshadows to get the right color or simply add more depth to the look. Avoid anything with sparkles or shimmer, as this will look unnatural."

      "content": "Dust the area with translucent powder. Make sure your skin is clean and free of any excess moisturizer. As your skin releases natural oils throughout the day, your makeup can begin to slide or will smudge easily. The powder will help absorb the oil and also give the makeup something to cling to so it stays put on your face. Use a soft, fluffy brush to disperse the powder."

      "content": "Use eyebrow powder or eyeshadow and a stiff, angled makeup brush to etch the shape of your brow. The application should be very light, just a vague suggestion of an eyebrow. You can use your other eyebrow as a guide for where your missing brow should begin and end. [2] X Expert Source Bia Rehman Licensed Esthetician & Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 8 November 2021. Otherwise, there are a few tricks you can use to figure it out. Hold a pencil against your nose. The edge of the pencil that is closer to your eye marks where your brow should start. Don't go any further inward than this line. [3] X Research source Keep the pencil held against your nose but pivot the tip so that it points to the outer corner of your eye. This should be about a 45-degree angle. That is where your brow should end. [4] X Research source The arch should be right above the outer edge of your iris (the colored part of your eye) if you are looking straight ahead.

It is important to keep the pencil very sharp, so make sure you stop to sharpen it and keep that fine tip. Don't press too hard or draw your strokes too dark. It will look more natural if you draw your eyebrows in several layers of light strokes. Again, use a cotton swab to fix any mistakes."

      "content": "Set your eyebrows by dusting again with translucent powder. For extra staying power, use a makeup sealer or lacquer that will protect your brows from moisture and from your own hands (it would be a shame to accidentally wipe off all your hard work). You simply paint this clear product over your brows and allow it to dry. It may look a bit shiny, so go over it with another layer of powder."

      "content": "Experiment with bangs . If you've ever wondered what you would look like with bangs, now is the perfect time to give them a shot. Cut them long enough to cover your eyebrows, but not so long that they are in your eyes. Try side-swept bangs if you've only lost one eyebrow. You can keep your bangs pretty long and leave your undamaged brow visible. If you're not prepared to cut your hair, you can buy clip-in bangs to wear until your eyebrow grows back. We explain how to stimulate hair regrowth below!"

High-quality pairs can be used for up to six months--plenty of time for your brows to grow back."

Make sure the hat is snugly on your head pull the bill down, toward your nose, until it covers your eyebrows. Make sure your school doesn't have a policy against wearing hats in class.

Your body relies on essential vitamins and proteins to build hair cell by cell, and improving blood flow to your eyebrows can help ensure your cells get what they need.

      "content": "Rub castor oil on your eyebrows. The omega fatty-acids are said to nourish cells and assist in hair growth, while also strengthening and moisturizing the hair. It is easily absorbed into the skin but should not block your pores and cause breakouts. Castor oil is sticky, so you may want to dilute it with a little coconut or almond oil. Dab some on your finger and then massage it into the area where you shaved your eyebrow. If you don't have castor oil, try a little extra virgin olive oil, which is supposed to have a similar effect.

You may see some regrowth right away from hairs that were about to emerge before you shaved your brows, but it may take several months for your brows to fully grow out. By applying a growth serum to your brows, your hair will be in the growth stage longer than normal, or it may believe it is always in this stage.

Providing your body with the building blocks of hair (proteins) plus vitamins that help with circulation and cell-repairing antioxidants may speed up hair growth. Hair growth stalls and can enter a resting state when you don't have enough protein, and hair can even begin to fall out if you don't get enough vitamins. [11] X Research source Make sure you get plenty of these foods: Greek yogurt, lean meats (like chicken and turkey), eggs, and nuts for protein. Sweet potatoes, carrots, and mangos for vitamin A. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source Eggs, almonds, wheat bran, salmon, low-fat cheese, and avocados for biotin (a B vitamin) that is hugely beneficial to hair growth.
