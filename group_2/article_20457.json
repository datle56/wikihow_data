      "title": "Set a timeline for him to leave and be with you.",
      "content": "Set a timeline for him to leave and be with you. Your man has probably told you that he’s planning to leave eventually but needs time. This is common, and most men don’t actually leave. This isn't fair to you, and you deserve better. Giving him a timeline makes him understand that you won’t be strung along. He may not leave, but you’ll avoid wasting time on him. You might say, “I want you to start divorce proceedings in the next 2 months. Otherwise, I don’t think we can be together.”"

      "content": "Put your relationship on hold if he doesn't leave her. Since few men actually leave their wives, there's a good chance that he's not going to leave her. This can be a really painful experience, and the best way to handle it is to take a step back from the relationship. If you continue seeing him, he has no incentive to leave her. Instead, tell him that you can't be with someone who won't commit to you and that you're not going to continue the relationship until he leaves. Say, \"What you're doing isn't fair to me. I deserve someone who's fully committed to me, so I need to take a break from this. I'll consider getting back together when you leave her.\""

[4] X Research source For example, invite him to go to a game if you share a favorite sports team, talk to him about what you see in your future if you have common goals, or ask him to do a shared hobby.
