      "content": "Pour water into a plastic container. Full up an ice tray, a food storage tub, a popsicle tray, or a plastic bottle with water. You can use room-temperature water, cold water, or hot water straight from the tap. Hot water actually freezes more quickly than cold water. Try freezing separate containers of hot and cold water to compare the results. [1] X Research source Feel free to try this out with other drinks like fruit juice or lemonade. If you use an ice cube tray or popsicle tray, you’ll be able to enjoy popsicles later on! Don’t use a glass container. The water will expand as it freezes and might break the glass. Breakage will also happen if you put a glass container filled with hot water in the freezer, so don’t ever try this."

Slide the container towards the back of the freezer so no one accidentally nudges it before the water freezes. Check to make sure the freezer is set to a temperature below 32 °F (0 °C), which is the freezing point of water. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave the water in the freezer for at least 3 hours. Try not to open up the freezer door during this time to keep the freezer nice and cold. While you wait, the water will begin freezing from the outside in. [3] X Research source Water in a smaller container will freeze faster than water in a bigger container, so you’ll need to wait several hours or overnight for a large amount of water to freeze completely. A tray of ice cubes will freeze in about 3 hours. A plastic water bottle might be frozen after 4 or 5 hours. Check back after 8 to 10 hours for a big plastic bowl of water. Sugary liquids like fruit juice will take longer than plain water to freeze. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the container from the freezer and observe the ice. You’ll see that the water has changed states from liquid to solid. This is a simple example of changing states from liquid to solid, or freezing. [5] X Research source If you leave the ice at room temperature, it will melt and return to its liquid state after a while. An ice cube will melt in a matter of minutes!"

Then roll it in a pile of granulated sugar until the skewer is covered in granules of sugar. [7] X Research source Set this to the side and allow it to dry. This will encourage more sugar crystals to form from the liquid solution."

While it heats up, stir the solution constantly. [8] X Research source Once it boils, keep stirring it until all of the sugar has dissolved. You’ve successfully created a solution, which is a combination of more than one compound. If you want to turn your crystallized sugar into edible rock candy , add a few drops of liquid food coloring and/or liquid food flavoring while the solution is still boiling. [9] X Research source"

[11] X Research source Then slowly lower the sugary end of the skewer into the middle of the container. Hold it in place with a clip or piece of tape and another skewer. If the top opening of the glass container is narrow, pinch the skewer with an alligator clip. The sides of the clip should rest on the rim of the container and keep the skewer in place. Another way to hold the skewer in place is to create a plus-shape out of 2 other skewers. Tape these 2 together and rest them over the rim of the container. Finally, tape the sugary skewer to the others so it remains upright."

Sugar crystals will begin to form around the skewer after a few days. Wait at least a full week to see more crystals grow.

Add another 30 seconds if necessary; the milk should be steaming but not yet bubbling. [15] X Research source Alternatively, this can be done in a saucepan on a stovetop, with adult supervision. Whole milk will work much better than 2% or skim milk because it has a higher fat content. Add extra calcium or lime to the milk this will help solidify the milk."

When the milk curdled, the liquid separated from the fat solids and casein protein solids. The fat and protein bonded together in a polymer chain, making it a plastic."

If you’d like, knead 1 drop of liquid food coloring into your ball of plastic to dye it. Then feel free to hand-sculpt it to your desired shape. [20] X Research source Wear disposable gloves to prevent the dye from staining your hands. You can also try rolling it out flat and cutting out a shape using a cookie cutter. Whatever you try, make sure to finish everything within 1 hour of pulling the curds out of the milk. It will harden soon after that."

To speed up the evaporation process, place the pan in the oven at roughly 325 °F (163 °C) and heat the solution for about 1 hour. Through the process of evaporation, the liquid water will turn to gas while the dissolved salt will return to its solid state. [23] X Research source"
