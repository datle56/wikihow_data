      "content": "Walk for at least 30 minutes 3 to 5 days a week. Going for regular walks improves your cardiovascular fitness gradually, but don't sweat it if you can't walk this long initially. Over time, your body will get used to a certain level of activity, and that makes it easier for you to walk longer. [2] X Research source If the outdoors aren't available to you this often or if the weather is unsuitable, use a treadmill or stationary bike inside instead. Always warm up before you start exercising. Start with static stretches, where you only stretch one muscle at a time. Then, move into dynamic stretches, like high-knees and jumping jacks, which gradually get your heart rate up.

      "content": "Go on a longer walk at least one day a week. Plan a longer walk for at least one of your sessions so you can gradually push your endurance. When you first start, the distance will likely be relatively short. However, as you progress, the distance will grow (as will the time commitment). For example, when you first start out, you may only be able to walk 2 miles (3.2 km) without getting tired. That would be your long walk. Each week, increase your long walk by 0.5 mi (0.80 km). Don't worry about where you start â€” just focus on improving a little each week."

      "content": "Vary terrain and elevation to change the level of resistance. Walking on grass or sand is more difficult than walking on a paved walking trail. Including plenty of hills on your route helps build your stamina as well. [5] X Research source When walking uphill, lean forward slightly to ease the weight on your leg muscles. Slow your pace as you head downhill and take shorter steps to avoid putting too much strain on your knees."

      "title": "Carry weight while walking.",
      "content": "Carry weight while walking. If you only have a short period of time to walk, add resistance to work on your stamina. You can buy ankle and wrist weights at sporting goods or department stores (or online), but this type of equipment isn't strictly necessary. You can also simply put a few books or solid objects in a backpack and carry that. Keep track of the amount of weight you're carrying so you can increase it incrementally. For example, you might walk with 10 pounds for 1 week, then start carrying 15 pounds. After you've been walking with weight for a few weeks, try walking without the weight and see how much further you can go."

      "content": "Find ways to include walking in your regular routine. Think of what you do throughout the day and figure out how you can introduce more walking into the mix. You'll gradually build stamina by getting your body accustomed to moving constantly rather than being sedentary. Here are some possibilities you might try: [6] X Research source Use the stairs instead of the elevator. Park further away from shops and walk the distance through the parking lot. Walk or bike to work. Pace while you're talking on the phone. Do stretches while watching TV."

Some trackers also have features that allow you to compete with others who have the same app, which can provide you with additional motivation. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Some smartphones come with built-in activity trackers that you can use for free. You can also buy activity trackers, such as FitBit, that allow you to record your workouts. These devices often also measure the distance you've walked and include information about your elevation, heart rate, and calories burned."

      "content": "Do at least 10 minutes of physical activity at a time. If you're trying to improve your stamina, shorter bursts of activity won't have the same benefits (although they will help). Even if you're just pacing around your home or jogging in place, keep up your activity for at least 10 minutes. For example, you might go on a 10-minute walk after each meal. That spreads your activity out over the course of the day and gets your body used to walking more (even if you've broken the longer walk up into pieces)."

      "content": "Try bodyweight exercises when you have downtime. Because bodyweight exercises don't require any equipment, you can do them anywhere. Any downtime you have waiting for something or someone can be put to use to help you become more active, even if it's simply doing a few jumping jacks or toe touches. Staying active during these times rather than just sitting down and waiting will help improve your cardiovascular stamina and endurance over time. [8] X Research source For example, you might do squats or lunges in the kitchen while you're waiting for water to boil. Space out your bodyweight exercises by at least 3 days. This way, your muscle fibers have enough time to rest and recover. [9] X Expert Source Monica Morris Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019.
