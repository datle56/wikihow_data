      "content": "Even out your skin tone with a light coat of foundation. The purpose of foundation is to cover up any discolored areas so that they blend in with the rest of your face. Focus on accomplishing this goal while applying a powder or an airy liquid foundation, and be conservative with the amount you use. Make sure to blend well with a makeup brush or sponge. The goal is to look natural, so avoid applying foundation in a thick, cakey way. [1] X Research source"
