      "title": "Have unsaturated (grayer) skin.",
      "content": "Have unsaturated (grayer) skin. Vampires are supposedly undead and only come out at night. This means their skin is usually more dead looking than the average color of human skin. For a more deathly complexion, apply a foundation that is grayer than your skin tone. Use a foundation that is one or two shades grayer than your skin. [1] X Research source Foundation makeup typically comes in a variety of thicknesses and styles, including powder or cream. For vampire purposes use the thicker foundation. Apply foundation in the center of your face and work toward your jawline. Blend using your fingers or a brush, according to the foundation you're using. If you have a dark complexion, don't worry! Vampires can have all different sorts of skin tones. It also helps to make your skin look really chiseled. Focus on shading and contouring around your jaw line and cheekbones to capture this look."

      "title": "Use dark eyeliner.",
      "content": "Use dark eyeliner. Vampires are dramatic and nocturnal looking. They also can be hundreds of years old. You want to look like you might have seen things nobody could possibly have seen. To pull this off, use dark eyeliner and possibly shadow to pull off the right look. Apply eyeliner and use a small amount of dark purple eye shadow with black mascara. This will help your eyes \"pop\" a little more than normal, giving you a dramatic look. Light red eye shadow around the eyes is also good. This hints at the connotations of you looking undead or bloody. For a more dramatic look, use darker eye shadow on the top of your eyes, and lighter eye shadow underneath your eyes. [2] X Research source Some people like to wear red contact lenses to complete their vampire look."

      "title": "Make your lips blood red.",
      "content": "Make your lips blood red. The lips are usually the most vibrant part of vampire makeup. Depending on your complexion and intended look, use somewhere between a bright red and blood red. Go for a basic matte style. If preferred, use lip gloss instead of lipstick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear dark clothes.",
      "content": "Wear dark clothes. Dark colors are the clothes of vampires. When you look in your closet, try to avoid things with bright, shiny, or pastel colors. Instead lean in favor of things that are solid and dark. You want to look like a creature of the night, not an outlet store model. Avoid conspicuous brand names and shirts with lots of prints on them. A black t-shirt and black jeans is a great everyday vampire look. You don't have to wear only black. A little bit of color can work as well. Dark purples and navy blues are just as appropriate as black."

    {
      "title": "Dress up.",
      "content": "Dress up. Another vampire look is the old, formal, Victorian style. Dress like you're ready to go out for a night on the town. Wearing elaborate, dark toned clothes that might seem out-of-date to give off the impression of the undead. For women, fancy black skirts, black or red tops with bell sleeves, corset tops, and black dresses are great for a vampire style. For men, try a dark suit jacket or overcoat with antique buttons. Wear dark pants with a white button up shirt for the perfect vampire style."

    {
      "title": "Have some \"everyday\" vampire clothes.",
      "content": "Have some \"everyday\" vampire clothes. You probably don't want to have to dress up like you're headed to a funeral every day. Black skinny jeans with a red, purple, or black top will help to create a more comfortable and contemporary vampire look. For girls, black skirts with ruby studded designs look awesome, but avoid clothes from the mall that are branded to be \"vampire\" theme. Wearing a Twilight t-shirt won't make you look like a vampire, it'll just make you look like a fan."

    {
      "title": "Wear the right shoes.",
      "content": "Wear the right shoes. Generally, vampires don't run around in tennis shoes or sneakers. They need the right kind of formal shoes to pull off the right look. For boys, chunky boots are always the best bet. You can wear dark leather dress shoes, or big black work boots for the right look. Doc Martens will work fine. For girls, shoes should be dark and dressy. Spiked flats or small heels will work, as well as Black Doc Martens."

      "title": "Dress practically.",
      "content": "Dress practically. Just because you want to look like a vampire doesn't mean you get to ignore the concerns of weather and dress code at your school. It'd be impractical to dress like you're going to an 18th century ball when it's 90 degrees out. [3] X Research source In cold weather, vampires usually wear long velvet cloaks in black or red, or a leather jacket or black trench coat. When it's hot, you'll probably have to ease up on the heavy makeup and thick layers, but try to stick to wearing black clothes and stay inside."

      "title": "Use some vampire accessories.",
      "content": "Use some vampire accessories. A couple of old accessories can help pull together a vampire look and make you look like you've been stalking the back alleys of London since the 1700s. Hit up swap meets, flea markets, and antique stores to find cheap old accessories. Any of the following will be perfect: Pocket watches Canes Antique brooches or pins Old necklaces Silver bangles and bracelets Amulets [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider wearing fangs.",
      "content": "Consider wearing fangs. Fangs are the hallmark of a vampire. If you’re dressing up like a vampire and you want people to understand what you’re dressing up as immediately, fangs will do the trick. If you do wear fangs, find small ones that don't look tacky. Plastic fangs from the coin machine at the grocery store will just look silly. [5] X Research source Tooth caps are much easier to speak with than a full mouthpiece, and they look more natural. You can also make fangs with acrylic, bits of straw, or even pieces of a fork. Apply lip stick after fitting your fangs to avoid a mess."

      "title": "Wear a cape.",
      "content": "Wear a cape. You want your cape to be either dark colors or red if you would like to stand out a little bit. Capes are another very recognizable component of vampire style. You can make your own cape out of fabric or drape, or buy one at a local party shop. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on elegant clothing.",
      "content": "Put on elegant clothing. If you want to really take your costume to the next level you should try wearing elegant and slightly outdated clothing. For men, a ruffled tuxedo shirt, black pants, and black shoes are the perfect costume. You can even wear a cummerbund if it appeals to you. For women, an elegant top and a long flowing skirt will perfectly compliment your fangs and cape. Remember to wear dark colors. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider make up. Using eye shadow to darken your eyes and white face paint to make your face look paler will add a huge boost to your vampire costume. You also can paint your nails purple or red. Male or female this will make you look even more haunting."

      "title": "Wear contacts.",
      "content": "Wear contacts. The eyes of a vampire are used to hypnotize others, so it's good to give your eyes an extra little something. Sparkly or shiny contacts can be a nice touch for a vampire costume or look. Be as creative as you want with them, and explore different colors and options. Gold colored contacts will give you the look of a Twilight vampire. If you wish to be a bit more extreme, try blood red, black, or even \"cat eyes.\" Be as unusual and creative as you wish. Many vampires wear sunglasses during the day, so that the bright sunlight doesn't hurt their eyes."

      "title": "Darken your hair.",
      "content": "Darken your hair. Black hair is usually the best bet for vampires. It creates a dramatic look contrasting with your lightened face. Consider dyeing your hair a darker shade , or going all the way to jet black. In some cases, a streak of white, purple, or red can be great for getting a vampire style in your hair. Consider darkening your hair, and include a single streak of color, as though you had your wits scared out of you at some point. Blondes, redheads, and people with any style and color of hair can achieve good vampire looks. Any color will work, as long as it works well with your complexion. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Straighten your hair.",
      "content": "Straighten your hair. Vampire hair is usually flat, straight, and dramatic looking. Use a hair straightener after you wash and dry your hair if you have curly hair, to pull off that lank hanging look. All kinds of cuts can look like vampire cuts, although a mysterious, full bodied cut usually has the best effect for women. Loose curls or waves can help create a sultry, mysterious appearance, depending on what you're going for. Men can pull off long or short styles, but a slicked back medium length cut that's short on the sides will always look dramatic and ominous for a vampire. It's the classic Bela Lugosi look."

      "title": "Consider a nontraditional cut.",
      "content": "Consider a nontraditional cut. Try having your hair long on one side and shaved near bald on the other, like a punk or techno vampire. You could also try a mohawk or dreadlocks . The vampire look is flexible and can be accepted with anything you're comfortable with. Consider nontraditional styles and cuts for pulling off your own unique look. [9] X Research source"
