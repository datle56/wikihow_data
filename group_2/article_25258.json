The king of that country promising that you would be granted citizenship. or A citizen of your own country promising that you would be granted citizenship (in the country to which they have never been). So, if we seek citizenship in heaven, we would want assurance from God Himself, rather than assurance from anyone else, right? The Bible claims to be the trustworthy word of God.

      "content": "Know what the problem is. Why wouldn't you go to heaven? You must first recognize that your default condition will prevent you from being accepted into heaven. You, as a human being, are infected with a spiritual disease (as all humans are—other than Jesus). This disease is called \"sin”. All the bad things you do and think are symptoms of this deadly disease. [4] X Research source Unless dealt with, sin disqualifies us for heaven and separates us from God. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what the solution is. God is holy and just, but He is also loving. God wants us to go to heaven, to be with Him. He also knows about our disease of sin that has separated us from Him. [5] X Research source Because of God's love, He chose to send Jesus to earth, in order to save us. [6] X Research source Jesus lived a perfect life and then took the death penalty on our behalf (because the punishment for sin is death). By doing this, God made it possible for sinful humans to be reconciled with Himself. In fact, this is the only way we can be reconciled with God. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Accept the solution. God has provided the way for us to be reconciled with Himself, through Jesus' death on our behalf. However, He does not force us to be reconciled; rather, He allows us to make the choice. [8] X Research source \"But to all who did receive him [Jesus], who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,\" ( John 1:12 ) If you want to put your trust in Jesus and return to God, then you can simply tell Him so. [9] X Research source Not sure what to say? God knows your heart; just be honest with Him and ask Him for help. You could tell Him something along the lines of: \"God, I know I'm a sinner. But I read that You love me and sent Jesus to pay for my sin. I choose to trust in Jesus. Please come and take Your rightful place as King in my life.\" And there you have it, how to be reconciled with God, who is in heaven. Jesus, in speaking to the Father, said, \" And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. \""
