      "content": "Use a socket wrench. Set both arms aside to be re-attached later. Windshields are difficult to handle and can be dangerous. Be very cautious when removing a windshield and get a helper to move the windshield. Using a heavy blanket or tarp, cover the front seats and dashboard to protect them from glass, debris, or any dripping urethane — a chemical used to seal the windshield in place. Also, make sure that you and your assistant are wearing gloves and eye protection."

      "content": "You may need to use a small knife or crowbar to get it off at first; some trim will require special trim removal tools to prevent trim damage. Remove the urethane weather stripping as well so that only the windshield remains. You may also use a knife to cut the seal along the perimeter before you try to pull it off. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a silicone-based lubricant. This will make it easier to slide the windshield out later. Apply lubricant around the edge between the windshield and the car frame. Wait several minutes for the lubricant to seep into the cracks before you move on. [3] X Research source Make sure the seal all the way around the windshield has been cut with a windshield removal cut tool. Very carefully work a rounded rod (a small phillips screwdriver or a tire repair tool also work great) between the gasket and the windshield frame. Keep it lubricated with glass cleaner as you slide the rod around it for better results."

      "content": "Attach large suction cups, which you can buy online, tightly to the glass. Pull up with even pressure while a friend pushes the windshield from the inside. It may be easier to have the person inside push the window out first, loosening the window, and then you pull with the suction cups. Have the person inside the car recline the seat back so he can get their feet onto the glass and use his legs to push. Do not stand on the hood or roof of the car — this will damage the body. The windshield may come out suddenly, so make sure you are steady and balanced and don't fall backwards."

      "content": "Using a paintbrush, add a thin amount of primer along the entire the inside edge of the window. You only need a strip about an inch wide. Then apply some primer to the windshield socket as well. Allow the primer to dry. Do not touch the primer or the oil in your fingers can prevent the sealer from sticking to the window or frame."
