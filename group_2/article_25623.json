When you're springing back up, use your toes to push off the trampoline. Dig them in right before the trampoline releases you and push off.

With a quick motion, bring them up above your head as you get to the top of your jump. As you're coming back to the trampoline, bring your arms down to your sides. Throughout the jump, try to keep your head and body in line. [4] X Research source After pumping your arms for a bit, try swinging them around in a circle. As you go up, lift your arms to your ears in front of you. As you go back down, bring your arms down behind you.

      "content": "Practice lifting your knees to your chest. As you jump into the air, bring your knees up as high as you can. Before you hit the trampoline, bring your legs back down. Try this over and over until you can do it without losing your balance. This ensures you're getting enough air to do a front flip. Make sure you're slightly closer to the edge facing the middle so you have some room to flip forward. Technically, you should flip in place, but when you're learning, you may end up moving forward."

      "title": "Jump off with the balls of your feet to start your flip.",
      "content": "Jump off with the balls of your feet to start your flip. Try to propel yourself upward mostly with your toes. When you jump off with the front of your feet rather than your whole foot, you naturally lean forward a bit. That will help you move into the front flip."

      "title": "Move your arms down quickly at the top of the jump.",
      "content": "Move your arms down quickly at the top of the jump. If you're gaining height like you're supposed to, your arms should be up in the air at the top of the jump. At that point, swing them down as hard as you can in front of you. That will begin the rotation of your front flip. [7] X Research source Act like you're slamming your arms down on a drum in front of you."

      "title": "Tuck your knees into your chest at the same time and allow yourself to spin.",
      "content": "Tuck your knees into your chest at the same time and allow yourself to spin. As you start to rotate forward, tuck in your knees to help continue the rotational movement. That will give you the momentum to flip forward on the trampoline. Let your body ride through the rotation. [8] X Research source Try not to panic the first time you start rotating to do a flip. Stay calm and keep spinning!"

      "content": "Untuck and land on your feet. As you come back around, straighten out your body. Try to land flat-footed and lift your arms up above your head to help you balance as you hit the trampoline. Keep practicing to get a feel for when you need to untuck and land. [9] X Research source If you keep landing on your bottom, you're likely not getting enough air or not kicking your feet out enough for the rotation."

      "content": "Kick harder in the first part of the flip to get more rotation. If you're having trouble going all the way around, you're not rotating fast enough. Try slamming your arms down harder and kicking back with more force in the first part of the flip, which will help speed up your rotation. Remember, these movements should be done at the same time to get the rotation going."

      "title": "Tuck in tighter to spin faster.",
      "content": "Tuck in tighter to spin faster. While tucking your body together is technically called a front tuck, this movement can help you get a feel for the front flip. Pull your body up as tight as you can in the flip. As you kick your legs back, draw your torso toward your legs, and grab onto your shins. The tighter you can tuck yourself, the faster your rotate. [10] X Research source Once you get the motion down with the tuck, try staying straight through the whole flip instead. It will be harder to rotate, but you just need to work on getting more momentum."

      "title": "Push your butt out early if you keep landing on your back.",
      "content": "Push your butt out early if you keep landing on your back. If you're not getting enough rotation, that could be because you're not creating enough momentum with your whole body. As you bring your arms down and kick your feet out, work on pushing your butt out, too. Pop it back and up, and that will help create some of the momentum you need to go all the way through the flip. [11] X Research source You can practice this movement on the ground. Find something about waist-high that will hold your weight, such as a table. Put your hands flat on the table in front of you. Step back slightly from the table with your hand still on it, then jump up in the air, trying to move your butt and back first. At the same time, keep your hands on the table. That will help you get this movement down."

      "content": "Extend your body as soon as you see the sky above you to land straight up. As you're coming around in the flip, you will see the horizon and then you'll be facing the sky. When you hit that point, straighten out your body to help stick the landing. [12] X Research source Stretch out both your arms and legs at this point. When you hit the trampoline, use your arms to balance yourself, then lift them above your head."

      "content": "Bring your hands down to meet the trampoline. In one fluid motion, bring your body forward enough that you basically fall over. Catch yourself with your hands, but use that momentum to keep rolling forward. As your head hits the trampoline, make sure it's tucked down so you quickly roll to the back of your head. The rest of your body will follow. [14] X Research source Make sure your chin is tucked down so you mainly hit the back of your head while rolling. However, don't allow the pressure to stay on your head; let the movement take your whole body through the roll."

Just roll into the somersault. As you keep adding air, you'll be getting closer and closer to the front flip. [16] X Research source Just do what you're comfortable with. You'll get more confident as you practice more!"
