Before you do anything else, make sure you don't have a flash or external drive connected to the PC, and remove any CDs or DVDs from your optical drive. Then, restart your PC to see if this resolves the issue. If your PC boots up without removable media connected, it was trying to boot from a drive that didn't contain a bootable operating system. You can avoid this in the future by removing connected/inserted media when rebooting, or by continuing with this method to change the boot order. If your PC still doesn't boot, continue with this method anyway."

If your PC is set to boot from external media like a USB flash drive or optical disc before your hard drive, it'll check for a bootable operating system on the removable media at boot time. If it doesn't find an operating system on the removable drive, you'll be prompted to insert boot media. To reboot into the BIOS or UEFI, you'll need to know your PC's setup key . This key is usually F2, F8, Del, Esc, or F10. When you reboot your PC, press the setup key repeatedly as soon as the PC restarts. You may see a message on the PC that says \"Press (setup key) to enter SETUP.\""

If you want to boot into the version of Windows or Linux installed on your PC, select the hard drive from the device list. To boot from a removable device like a flash or external drive, choose Removable or similar. If your hard drive is not found, the drive itself might be disconnected from the motherboard. You will need to open your computer and check the cabling. If everything is nice and secure, it's likely your hard drive is dead. The steps to choose a boot order are different in each BIOS. You may have to manually reorder all devices by selecting them and using the arrow keys to move them up or down. Sometimes you'll have to choose 1st and select a device. The device you set as first in the boot order will be the first drive your PC boots from each time you turn it on. If you set a removable drive or CD/DVD as first in the boot order, you can still boot into the operating system installed on your hard drive—just be sure to disconnect the removable media or remove the CD/DVD when rebooting."
