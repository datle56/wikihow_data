      "content": "Cover your mannequin head. There are a few options. Spray your mannequin head with a light coat of spray adhesive and cover the head with fabric. Cut off at the bottom edge of the can so that the can will stand. Paint the mannequin with colored paint. For light colors, make sure to do more than 1 coat. Use spray paint for a fast application. For a detailed painted mannequin head, use different color paints to draw features. Take a plain or patterned nylon sock or tights. Stretch it over the head of the mannequin head and the can. Knot it at the back of the can. This is the fastest way to cover your mannequin with a layer of fabric, as it does not require any drying time."
