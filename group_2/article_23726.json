Some stuff is difficult to sit through, but learning to appreciate the fun in a long game of chess, or the story told in Anna Karenina can help your attention span improve in other parts of your life.

You can have fun to, and you don't have to actually like reading Anna Karenina . Mental stamina isn't just an excuse to be pretentious.

Of course, if you're a coffee drinker, it's fine to have a cup-but stop after one. Avoid heavy saturated fats, sugary foods, and high caffeine levels.

Yoga, deep breathing, and other types of simple relaxation techniques can also be quite effective.
