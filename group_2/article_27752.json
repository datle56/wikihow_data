Slip on a pair of goggles, gloves, and a long-sleeve shirt to protect your skin. Then, pour 4.5 fl oz (130 mL) of distilled water into a stainless steel pitcher . [1] X Research source Use a thick, durable plastic pitcher if you don’t have one made of stainless steel. Keep in mind lye can burn through some plastics and aluminum. Generally, polypropylene plastic (PP#5) is safe to use. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Carefully stir in 2.14 oz (60 g) of food-grade lye to the water pitcher. To prevent a chemical reaction, sprinkle lye into the water—do not mix water into lye because it can overheat and explode. Use a silicone spatula to stir the water as you pour the lye in. Continue stirring to dissolve the lye. [3] X Research source Lye is found in every kind of soap. It's essential to the soap-making process because it helps blend oils and water to make soap. [4] X Research source While lye is a natural ingredient, it isn’t technically organic—but it is one of the new non-organic ingredients the USDA allows within their organic standards. If you’re uncomfortable handling lye, consider purchasing a pre-made soap base (which already has the lye incorporated) to make melt and pour soap . Lye is caustic. Avoid getting it on your skin or near your face or breathing in its fumes by working near an open window or using a fan to circulate the air.

      "content": "The natural chemical reaction of lye with the water will be incredibly hot. Be careful when handling or transporting the solution. [8] X Research source When mixed with water, lye can reach temperatures as high as 200 °F (93 °C). Even after you have let it cool down, the solution will still be considerably hot—around 100–110 °F (38–43 °C). [9] X Research source Do not use any container, utensils, molds, or pitchers used to measure or make the soap to work with food, even after you wash them. The contamination caused by the lye makes these materials unsafe for food prep or consumption."

Once all solidified remnants of the oil have melted, remove it from the heat. [10] X Research source A similar product to coconut oil is babassu oil , vegetable oil from the babassu palm in South America. Use equal amounts of this oil if you’re allergic to coconut oil or want to try something different."

Add 12 fluid ounces (350 mL) of olive oil , 1.5 fluid ounces (44 mL) of castor oil , and 2.5 fluid ounces (74 mL) of melted coconut oil. The castor oil will create a lather in the soap bar, while the olive oil will soften and condition your skin. Coconut oil will help harden the soap.

Be careful not to burn yourself, as the lye and the oils are hot. [12] X Research source The temperature of the oils and lye solution should be around 100–110 °F (38–43 °C). Use a stainless steel thermometer to check this before mixing the two solutions. If the oil temperature is lower, heat it in the double boiler until the temperatures are the same.

For instance, you could add a dash of cosmetic clays to change the soap color to pink or green. Or, you could add petals and leaves from your favorite flowers or herbs for more vibrant colors and interesting textures. However, if you love a yellow or cream color, you can skip this step since the olive oil will tint your soap. [15] X Research source Herbs suitable for use in soap that are both beautiful in appearance/texture and good for your skin include calendula flowers (not to be confused with marigolds), geranium flowers, Irish moss, comfrey, carrot seed, and chickweed. If you want your soap bar to exfoliate your skin, consider adding coffee grounds, seaweed, or oatmeal. [16] X Research source"

Continue this process for about 10-15 minutes. [18] X Research source For soap making, thickened soap batter is called “trace.” This means that the batter is thick enough for you to drip some onto the surface of the batter and have it remain on the surface. When a soap reaches this consistency, it no longer needs to be mixed and is ready to be poured into the mold."

Myrrh resin or frankincense essential oil are other suitable options for adding to soaps."

A standard mold will have an approximate 4 by 4 in (10 by 10 cm) length and width, and 3 in (7.6 cm) height. [20] X Research source Consider getting a silicone mold with a fun pattern or design to personalize your homemade soap. You can also use a loaf mold that is not sectioned off and cut the soap into individual bars later. Don’t use muffin tins or baking pans you already own since the batter can ruin them.

If it develops cracks, leave it covered, but move it to a cooler location like a dark closet or a cool basement. [22] X Research source Use freezer paper over standard wax paper, as freezer paper is thicker. Wax paper might melt against the heat of the soap batter. Alternatively, you can use parchment paper."

You will notice that the texture of the soap batter will gradually change to a gelatinous state over the 3 days. By the third day, it should seem fairly firm if you touch it with your finger. [23] X Research source If your soap isn’t hardening, it may be a result of too much or too little lye, or too much oil. Double-check your measurements. If you’ve used too much lye, unfortunately, you’ll have to scrap the batch. If there’s too little lye, test it with pH strips and add 10 g (0.35 oz) of lye in 20 mL (0.68 fl oz) of distilled water. Add it slowly and test regularly until the pH is between 9 and 10. If you’ve used the correct amount of lye, add 15 mL (0.51 fl oz) of distilled water to a batch. Cut or grate the failed batch and add it to a slow cooker. Pour in the new solution and let it melt on low for 2 to 3 hours. Adding more liquid as needed. Then, pour it into the silicone mold and try again! [24] X Research source"

After that time, the soap will be ready for you to use and enjoy! [25] X Research source Store your soap away from direct sunlight and in dry, well-ventilated areas for up to 1 year. Soaps that use a higher water ratio to olive oil will only need to be cured for 4-6 weeks instead.
