Above is a visualization of the function with both definitions - unnormalized (in red) and normalized (in blue). We will be evaluating the unnormalized sinc function. ∫ − ∞ ∞ sin ⁡ x x d x {\\displaystyle \\int _{-\\infty }^{\\infty }{\\frac {\\sin x}{x}}\\mathrm {d} x} We see from the graph that sin ⁡ x x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\sin x}{x}}} is an even function, which can be confirmed by looking at the function above. Then, we can factor out a 2. 2 ∫ 0 ∞ sin ⁡ x x d x {\\displaystyle 2\\int _{0}^{\\infty }{\\frac {\\sin x}{x}}\\mathrm {d} x} The integral above with bounds of 0 to infinity is also known as the Dirichlet integral."

The solution is to use an indented contour that goes around the pole. ∫ Γ e i z z d z {\\displaystyle \\int _{\\Gamma }{\\frac {e^{iz}}{z}}\\mathrm {d} z} The contour Γ {\\displaystyle \\Gamma } is split into four parts. We begin from − a {\\displaystyle -a} and traverse the real line to some small number − ϵ . {\\displaystyle -\\epsilon .} Then a semicircular arc γ ϵ {\\displaystyle \\gamma _{\\epsilon }} with radius ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } goes clockwise to ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } on the real axis. This contour then goes to a , {\\displaystyle a,} from which a semicircular arc γ a {\\displaystyle \\gamma _{a}} with radius a {\\displaystyle a} goes counterclockwise and back to − a . {\\displaystyle -a.} The important thing to note here is that this integral does not have any singularities within the contour, and is therefore 0.
