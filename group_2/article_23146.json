      "content": "Reflect on the things you’re unhappy about, and make some changes. You’re not always in control of what happens to you, but you can control how you respond to situations that are making you worried or unhappy. “Sometimes the best way to cope with worry is to take action,” explains Dr. Carmichael. “For example, if I’m worried about my financial future, I should go see a financial planner, or take a step to assuage and address the worry,” she says. If you’re experiencing stress or burnout due to work or school, try adding some relaxation and self-care to your routine. You could meditate , do yoga, pick up a relaxing hobby like crocheting or reading—whatever you prefer! If you’re struggling with a toxic platonic, romantic, or familial relationship, work on setting boundaries with this person and prioritizing your own needs. If you’re dealing with a mental or physical health problem, schedule an appointment with your doctor to come up with a plan to better address your symptoms. Identifying the cause of your negative feelings and then taking charge of that situation can be very healing and empowering! It reminds you that you’re not helpless and that things can change for the better. [1] X Research source"

When you’re going through a difficult time emotionally, you may feel tempted to isolate yourself. “It turns into a really vicious circle because you get lonely, but you’re also pushing people away or not engaging with them,” explains Dr. Carmichael. If this sounds like you, try to make a conscious effort to connect and spend quality time with the people you love.

If you’re experiencing negative thoughts about yourself, others, or the world in general, Dr. Carmichael recommends volunteering . “When we start helping other people, we start noticing that other people might even have bigger problems than we do that they seem to be managing,” she explains. In other words, volunteering can provide some much-needed perspective. Being useful to others also helps you combat any feelings of worthlessness you may be experiencing, says Dr. Carmichael. Think about the causes you care about, and pick a volunteer opportunity that resonates with you. For example, if you care deeply about the environment, you could volunteer for a beach clean-up. Or, if you’re passionate about helping people who are experiencing food insecurity, you could volunteer at a food drive."

Unfortunately, our negative thoughts are often the result of patterns we’ve built over the years, and most people can’t just turn them off at will. Instead, try reciting positive affirmations to drown out the negative voice in your head. “How do you fight darkness? You find the nearest light switch, and you turn on the light,” Ravikant explains. For example, you could say “I’m worthy and deserving of love,” or “I’m doing the best I can, and that’s enough.” Don’t worry if you find this tough to do at first. “Self-love is a practice, just like going to the gym is a practice, just like eating healthy is a practice,” says Ravikant.

If you think self-esteem issues are contributing to your negative feelings about life, try setting some personal goals and going after them. “The best way to build up self-confidence is to make commitments to yourself and keep them,” explains Ravikant. When you do this, “You start to trust yourself, and you start to become a person who can count on themselves,” which is “fundamental for self-confidence.” For example, you could decide that you’re going to make healthier choices with food. “You make a commitment that you’re going to eat a certain way, and then you stick to it. You may fail here and there, but you stick to it overall. You develop a sense of confidence in your ability to do this,” says Ravikant. You could challenge yourself to read one book per month, get at least 8 hours of sleep each night, or learn a new skill at work—it’s completely up to you!"
