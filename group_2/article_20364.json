[3] X Research source You can also catch a couple goats and start a goat farm! Use a lead to guide them into a fenced area. There you can breed them with wheat to get more goats (and more horns!). Goats that spawn naturally only have a 2% chance of being a screaming goat. If you find one, you might want to breed it to avoid having to find more naturally spawning screaming goats. If a normal goat is bred with a screaming variation, there’s a 50% chance that the baby will be a screaming goat. If you breed 2 screaming goats, there’s a 100% chance of a screaming baby (in Java Edition). In Bedrock, there’s a 98% chance of a screaming goat baby. Breeding 2 normal goats has a 2% chance of spawning a screaming goat baby."

[6] X Research source They may appear in biomes with or without villages — plains, desert, savanna, taiga, meadow, grove, snowy slopes, peaks. Java Editions outposts won’t spawn in or near villages; Bedrock outposts can spawn in villages. There will be pillagers that you’ll need to fight or avoid to get the loot chest contents at the top of the outpost tower. Look out for their crossbow shots!"
