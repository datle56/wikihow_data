      "content": "Get a radio scanner capable of reading frequencies in the 118-137 MHz band. All Air Traffic Control (ATC) channels rely on the frequencies in the 118.000–136.975 MHz band, so any radio or scanner that can register these bands will work. There are two major types of scanner: handheld and standard. The handheld scanners look like walkie talkies and can be taken anywhere, while the standard scanners are a bit more substantial. [1] X Research source You can buy a cheap and efficient scanner online or use an app that functions as a scanner. If you’re looking for popular airband scanners, Uniden are considered the best in the business. Check out the Bearcat series (especially the UBC-125XLT or SDS100 ). The IC-R6 and IC-R15 by Icom are also well-loved options. Many modern scanners come with additional functions, like alarm clocks, police scanners, weather alerts, and more."

      "content": "Tune the scanner to any of the common ATC frequencies. There are a handful of ATC and aviation-related frequencies that are basically universal regardless of the airport. [2] X Research source 121.5 is the emergency frequency. If there is some sort of emergency, pilots will transmit on it. You could also hear an emergency locator beacon on this frequency if a plane crashes. 122.750 MHz is the frequency for general aviation air to air communications. 123.025 MHz is the frequency for helicopters air to air communications. 123.450 MHz is the \"unofficial\" frequency for air to air communications. Search 122.0-123.65 for Unicom (uncontrolled airports) and air to air communications. Search 128.825-132.000 MHz for ARINC frequencies (airlines, corporate aviation and general aviation calling ahead for fuel, parking, and other requests)."

      "content": "Use your scanner’s search function to find unique frequencies. Most scanners have an auto-search function that will automatically swap between active channels so that you aren’t searching through static. [3] X Research source Use the auto-scanner to find interesting ATC frequencies near you. You may even stumble on something totally unexpected, like the frequency for the plane’s tugs, or the channel for updating flight paths! [4] X Research source If you have a two-way scanner where you can broadcast frequencies, do not attempt to interfere or talk to an active aviation channel. It is a serious crime to mess with aviation channels you aren’t supposed to participate in, and the authorities take this kind of thing very seriously. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source There are alternatives to LiveATC.net, but LiveATC is easily the most popular and reputable site for getting a peek into the ATC world on a live basis. Alternatives include: Futura Studios ATC Box LiveATC also has an app if you prefer to use your phone! It’s free for Android and only $5 for iPhone users."

      "content": "No, ATC feeds and pilot communications are public information. Listening to an ATC feed is sort of like listening to a police scanner: anyone can do it because transparency is important in these fields where safety is everything. You are 100% in the clear to listen to public ATC broadcasts. This extends to tracking flights, too–you can totally follow a specific plane’s flight plan and audio if you want to. [7] X Research source * The following ATC-related behaviors are* illegal:** Interfering with ATC communications. Trying to communicate with pilots or controllers on ATC channels. Listening specifically to ATC feeds originating in the United Kingdom. [8] X Research source Trying to access hidden or secure ATC channels. Selling any information you acquire by listening to an ATC feed."

      "content": "Each plane has their own call sign flight number. If a controller gives a pilot an instruction or a pilot wants to talk to a controller, they always start by saying the aircraft’s identification number. For commercial flights, this will just be a carrier and a flight number, such as United 2311. A smaller aircraft is identified by the number on their tail. [9] X Research source Repeating the flight number confirms for all parties that they’re talking to the right person. The carrier names used in communication aren’t always the name of the carrier (although they often are, such as “United 2311” or “Southwest 4023”). Often, it’s a shorter slang term to avoid confusion. For example, British Airways uses “Speedbird” since a lot of carriers have the word “Airways” in them. You can find all of the call signs here ."

      "title": "The controllers give pilots instructions and answer requests.",
      "content": "The controllers give pilots instructions and answer requests. The controller’s main job is to control the flow of traffic and maintain safe separations between flights. They also are responsible for providing navigational assistance to the pilots. Unless there is an emergency, the controller has the “final word” over what a flight does. Pilots must ask for permission before they land, takeoff, taxi (drive on the runways), or change their flight path. [10] X Research source You’ll hear controllers say “ clear to X,” which means the pilot of the relevant callsign and flight ID number is allowed to do whatever X is. Controllers will use affirmative and negative for “yes” and “no.” If a controller asks a pilot to report something, it means they want the pilot to tell them when/if they see something. Controllers will often ask a pilot to squawk a specific number. This means they want a pilot to adjust their transponder to a certain code. If a controller asks a pilot to “say X,” it means they’re asking for information. So, “say altitude” means “I need your altitude.” “Say heading” means, “I want your heading.”"

      "title": "Pilots typically ask for navigational help or permission.",
      "content": "Pilots typically ask for navigational help or permission. The pilot is not in control of when they land, when they takeoff, or when they deviate (meaning to change a flight path off of a written plot). Pilots may also ask for weather reports, info on which runways are available, and if there are any tips they need to know about a given area. “Wilco” is ATC shorthand for “I will accept your request.” So, if a pilot says, “United 2401, we’d like to ascend to 20,000 feet to get above this storm cloud,” ATC might reply, “Wilco, United 2401, ascend to 20,000 feet.” Pilots cannot ignore a controller’s instructions unless they declare an emergency. They must actively say, “Mayday,” or, “ Declaring an emergency.” The pilot will then announce their intentions , which are their next steps. Sometimes, pilots will use “unable” as a way of saying “I cannot complete your request” without declaring an emergency."

      "content": "Switch your ATC channel to follow a single plane. Controllers do not spend an entire flight with a given pilot–they “hand the plane off” whenever a plane passes a certain territory and enters another ATC zone. An example would be a controller saying, \"November-12345, contact Approach on 124.32, good day. [11] X Research source In this situation, switching your scanner or channel to the 124.32 MHz will allow you to continue following the flight!"

A star will be after the tower frequency to denote that airport as having a part time tower. At this type of airport, pilots communicate directly with one another and tell each other their position and intentions. [14] X Research source Uncontrolled airports will be very informal environments compared to controlled airports. You won’t hear all of the same buzzwords and signals you normally do."
