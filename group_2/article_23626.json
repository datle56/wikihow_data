If you want to remember that you parked your car on Logan Boulevard, you may imagine Wolverine from X-Men sitting in your back seat. Doing this in your head can dramatically improve your ability to recall specific information, and it can be a fun exercise as well! [4] X Research source For another example, if you’re bad with names and you meet someone named Evelynn, you might think, “Christmas Eve” and picture this person dressed as Santa. If you find a brand of potato chips you like, called “Umbrella Chips,” you may picture a stack of spuds sitting on a beach under a parasol.

When you juggle multiple activities, your attention is divided, which will make it hard to process the information necessary to remember what you’re doing. If you want to remember things more clearly, focus on one task at a time. Keep your phone in your pocket, take your headphones off, and aim to dedicate yourself to the task at hand.

While memorization takes place entirely in the brain, writing is a physical act. By combining memorization with the act of writing, it helps your brain commit the information to memory. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Oddly enough, research seems to indicate that it’s hard to achieve the same effect by typing something on your phone or laptop, so you’re better off sticking to pen and paper if you really want to remember your friend’s birthday or next week’s dentist appointment.

[12] X Research source If you’re trying to remember something, spend a few minutes walking around your neighborhood to see if it helps. At worst, you’ll get some exercise and relax a little.

Lay down or do jumping jacks while reciting something you really want to internalize. Routines are great if you want to establish good habits, but they also make it more likely that you go through the motions without processing what you’re doing. Even something as simple as taking your laptop off of your desk and working at your kitchen table can help you remember what you’re doing in the future. [16] X Research source [17] X Research source Routines require very little effort or attention. This is why people occasionally forget to stop at a grocery store or post office on their way home from work—they’re just not used to doing it. This is known as procedural memory, where you memorize the routine instead of the material. By changing the procedure, you make easier to form a memory! [18] X Research source"

[19] X Research source The reasoning here is pretty straightforward: caffeine wakes you up, which gives your brain a boost. This can help you remember specific information that’s just on the tip of your tongue. [20] X Research source Caffeine will help you remember things from you past, but it won’t help you form new memories. As a result, drinking a pot of java while you’re studying isn’t a particularly good way to commit the material to memory. [21] X Research source"

If you’re studying for a big test, you’re more likely to get a good grade by snoozing than you would by cramming all night and studying.

[34] X Research source While the relationship between sleep and memory isn’t entirely understood, it’s suggested that sleep helps you consolidate memories, which is the process where new information is converted into something you can remember."
