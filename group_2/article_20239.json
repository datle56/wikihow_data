If you are part of the LGBTQ community, you may have a circle of friends that you hang out with, and there is a chance, perhaps just a small chance, that you may already know someone that you want to date in that circle. If this is not the case, you can find a potential boyfriend while going to school, work, and even while traveling. The opportunities are endless. If you meet someone and you know that he has a same-sex preference and you also know that he is public about his sexual preference, then you can be cautiously public about expressing your interest in getting to know him. If you meet someone and you are not sure about his sexual preference, hold off on publicly expressing any feelings that you may have towards him because this could create an uncomfortable situation for both of you.
