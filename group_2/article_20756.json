      "content": "Keep your bedroom cool. Sleeping in a hot room is a recipe for twisted sheets and feverish dreams, whereas a cool, dark environment will help you to fall asleep faster and sleep better. The optimal temperature for sleeping is between 18 and 20 degrees Celsius (65 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit), so turn down the thermostat and snuggle under the covers. Of course, it won't be easy to fall asleep if your room is frigid, so find a temperature that works for you, just try to err on the cool side. Remember that it's better to pile on the blankets in a cold room than to kick off the covers in a hot room. If you suffer from hot flashes or night sweats, there are other things you can do to keep yourself cool. Consider investing in a cooling mattress pad and some moisture-wicking sheets to keep body temperature down and draw sweat from the skin."

      "title": "Turn off all lights and electronic equipment.",
      "content": "Turn off all lights and electronic equipment. Darkness helps your brain to process the fact that it's time for sleep, causing it to release hormones that induce sleepiness. If you have too much light in your bedroom, or stare at a screen for too long before turning in, this can delay the release of these hormones and prevent you from falling asleep. To combat this, keep your bedroom as dark as you possibly can and turn off all electronics at least an hour before bed. Avoid having a light up clock in your bedroom. Knowing that it's 3 A.M. and you're still wide awake is not going to help the situation. It will simply increase your anxiety and make falling asleep even less likely. [2] X Research source Avoid installing a television or games console in your bedroom and try not to bring your laptop to bed. You want your brain to identify your bedroom as a place of peace and sleep, not one of work and play. Turn off your cell phone or at least put it on 'do not disturb' mode. Make sure that your phone is away from you, as you might have pop-up notifications coming from your screen, or calls, which will make you feel disturbed. If you need to have it next to you, keep your phone switched off. If it's sitting on your bedside table, the temptation to check your emails, your Facebook page, or even the time will keep you awake. Make sure you have around 1-2 hours without technology before bed."

      "title": "Put away your clock.",
      "content": "Put away your clock. Usually, when a watch, alarm clock, or phone is kept close to you, it will be tempting to constantly check the time. Thinking about not sleeping will only stress you out and feel sleep-deprived. Don't keep thinking about how lack of sleep today will cause your day to be bad tomorrow, as that will only keep you wider awake."

      "title": "Make sure your pillows and mattress are comfortable.",
      "content": "Make sure your pillows and mattress are comfortable. If you find your bed uncomfortable, it's hardly a wonder that you have trouble getting to sleep. Consider whether its time to invest in a new mattress, one that's harder or softer depending on your needs. Alternatively, you could try flipping your existing mattress over, as the underside may have fewer lumps and bumps. People with neck or back trouble may benefit from a memory foam pillow, which contours to each individual's body shape and provides them with the support they need. If buying a new mattress seems a little extreme, consider a new set of sheets. Go for as high a thread count as possible and choose a finish based on your individual preferences. For crisp, cool sheets, go with percale. For warmth and comfort, choose flannel. For a touch of luxury, use Egyptian cotton. You can also purchase a mattress pad for a different level of support and comfort. Launder your sheets at least once a week -- people tend to sleep better on crisp, clean sheets. Also try to get into the habit of making your bed every morning. A made-up bed is much more inviting than a messy one."

      "content": "Lightly fragrance your bedroom with essential oils. Something as simple as a whiff of essential oil can help your body relax and your mind drift off to dreamland. According to several studies, lavender is the number one fragrance for inducing a deep sleep, while also helping people to fall asleep faster. [3] X Research source Get your hands on a good quality bottle of lavender essential oil and use it in one of the following ways: Sprinkle a few drops of the essential oil on a piece of cloth and slip it under your pillowcase. Dilute a few drops of the oil in some water and place it in a diffuser in your bedroom, or use the lavender water to iron your sheets. If you can swing it, get a partner to give you a relaxing massage using the lavender oil as a massage oil. Lavender bags are also useful to put under your pillow or do something else If lavender isn't your thing, there are other relaxing and calming scents you can experiment with in your quest for sleep. Bergamot, marjoram, sandalwood and geranium aromatherapy oils are all good options."

      "content": "Make your bedroom a noise-free zone. Distracting or annoying noises can be a big obstacle to falling asleep. Do your best to keep your bedroom as quiet and peaceful as possible, by shutting your doors and windows or asking your housemates to turn down the television. For noise you can't do anything about, like your partner's snoring or the banging party upstairs, consider wearing noise-cancelling earplugs -- They may feel a tad strange or uncomfortable at first, but once you overcome that you will be blissfully unaware of any external disturbances. [4] X Research source Another option is to invest in a white noise machine or app, which produces random sounds at a variety of frequencies, thus masking other noises. True white noise can be somewhat harsh sounding, so many of these machines produce what are known as \"color\" noises, which are softer and may sound like a rushing waterfall or a gentle hum. You could also just find a cd with some relaxing music, or even sounds from nature, and leave that softly playing in the background as you sleep. Try not to sleep with earphones in though, as these can become uncomfortable or get tangled while you sleep."

      "content": "Soak in a hot bath. A leisurely soak in a hot bath is one tried and tested method for falling asleep faster. There are several reasons why this is so effective. Firstly, having a bath will reduce stress and help you to clear your mind of the worries of the day, which are responsible for keeping you awake at night. Secondly, having a hot bath raises your body temperature, which then quickly drops when you get out. This mimics the actions of the brain, which triggers body-cooling hormones when it's time for bed. [5] X Research source You can enhance the sleep-inducing qualities of your bath even further by adding a couple of drops of your favorite essential oil, such as lavender or chamomile oil, to the water. And why not add some soothing music and light some candles, while you're at it? If you don't have time for a bath (or don't have a bathtub) a hot shower will produce the same effect. Just try to keep the water temperature above 37 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and stay in there for at least 20 minutes, for best results. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Have a snack and a warm drink.",
      "content": "Have a snack and a warm drink. Although eating a heavy meal right before bed isn't such a good idea, tummy rumbles are even worse for preventing sleep, so try to avoid going to bed hungry. A light snack before bed, such as a piece of fruit, some crackers or a low-fat yogurt are perfect. Drink a soothing chamomile or passionflower tea, or a glass of warm milk which contains the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. Any snack that contains complex carbohydrates, such as whole grain bread or cereals, is good because these increase your body's tryptophan levels. Tryptophan is a chemical which encourages the brain to produce more serotonin, a happy, relaxing hormone which induces sleep. Some great bedtime snacks to consider are any kind of nuts or seeds (especially pumpkin seeds), whole grain bread or crackers with a little cheese, or cereal and warm milk. Avoid anything very greasy or spicy."

      "content": "Wear comfy pajamas. As mentioned before, being comfortable in bed is essential for falling asleep quickly, so the importance of wearing comfy pajamas cannot be overstated. Avoid pajamas that are too tight, made from uncomfortable materials or have buttons that will stick into you as you sleep. Aim for something loose and soft, which won't leave you too hot or too cold in the middle of the night. If pajamas feel too constricting, consider going naked . Many people enjoy the sensation of freedom and comfort that comes with sleeping nude, particularly on hot nights. Just make sure no one is likely to walk in on you, especially if you're prone to kicking off the covers!"

      "content": "Do some stretching. Doing a few simple stretches before bed can help to release tension from your muscles and relax your body for sleep. In fact, a study conducted by a Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that women who did 15 to 30 minutes of upper and lower body stretches before bed, decreased their issues with falling asleep by 30%. [7] X Research source Try lying on your back on the bed or on the ground and bending your right leg as if trying to touch your knee to your chin. You should feel the stretch in your hamstring and lower back. Hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds, then repeat with the other leg. Sit in a cross-legged position, place your right hand on the floor beside you and raise your left arm above your ear. Lean to the right, keeping your shoulders down and your butt cheeks on the floor. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds then repeat on the other side. This stretches your neck, back, shoulders and obliques. For more stretching techniques, see the article how to stretch ."

      "content": "Read, write or play a game before bed. Reading, writing and simple game playing can help you to unwind before bed by releasing stress and distracting you from thinking about other issues. If you choose to read, don't go for anything too exciting or scary, as this might get your heart racing! Choose something a little duller, like a newspaper or textbook, which will soon have your eyelids drooping. Some people find writing in a journal very therapeutic, as it helps them to get any problems or issues out of their mind and on paper instead. Alternatively, you could try making lists, such as everything you ate that day, or the errands you need to run tomorrow. This can be tedious and should hopefully have you nodding off in no time. Simple word or number games, such as sudoku or crossword puzzles can be a pleasant nighttime activity which can help tire out your brain before sleep."

It requires enough mental concentration to distract you from thinking about anything else, but it's also quite boring, which is good for inducing sleep. Try the time-honored technique of visualizing sheep jumping over a fence, or use the psychologist recommended method of counting backward from 300 by 3s.

      "content": "Get out of bed. It may sound counter-intuitive, but sometimes the best thing you can do when you're having trouble falling asleep is to get out of bed and distract yourself by doing something else. Lying in bed and freaking out about the fact that you're not sleeping is not productive. Try reading a book, watching a little TV, listening to music, or making a snack. Stay out of bed for 30 to 60 minutes, or until you start feeling tired. This technique will help your brain to associate your bed with sleeping."

Think of the ocean, a rainbow, a tropical desert island, anything that makes you feel happy and peaceful. A more elaborate version of this is to think up scenarios or imagine activities that you enjoy. Imagine yourself as a superhero or celebrity, mentally design your dream home, or think about playing with a room full of kittens or puppies."

      "content": "Reduce your caffeine intake. If you regularly experience problems with falling asleep, it may be time to cut down on your caffeine intake. Caffeine can last in your system up to five hours after it was consumed, so it's usually best to have your last cup coffee around lunch time. Switch to non-caffeinated herbal teas for the rest of the evening, and try a special \"sleepy-time\" blend, with ingredients like chamomile or valerian, before bed."

Melatonin is a hormone which regulates sleep. It can be purchased inexpensively in supplement form -- usually a low dosage taken before bedtime will do the trick. If you find yourself still waking up, try an extended-release option. Chlor Trimeton, a type of antihistamine, is another supplement that causes drowsiness and can help with sleeping problems. Valerian root is one of the oldest known treatments for insomnia, but nowadays you can take it in supplement form rather than drinking a tea made from boiling the root itself. It is believed to improve the quality of sleep in addition to reducing the time it takes to nod off."

Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time everyday, at least on weekdays. Over time, this will allow your internal body clock to naturally recognize when it's time to go to sleep, helping you to fall asleep faster. Don't worry if you sleep in a little on the weekends, as this can actually be good for your body and help it to heal and restore itself after the stresses of the week. [11] X Research source"
