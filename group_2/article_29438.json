The long portion of your rope is the working end. This is the portion you will use to create the knot."

[1] X Research source Start the first wrap on the area of your fingers closest to your palm. Each successive wrap should be closer to the tips of your fingers. Try wrapping the paracord around your first three fingers, or even just your first two to make it easier. [2] X Research source"

With your free hand remove the rope from the hand you wrapped it around, keeping the first set of turns in place. Keep the first three turns intact by pinching the rope together with your forefinger and thumb. You can also keep the rope on your hand if you wish and thread the next horizontal loops through your finger. [3] X Research source"

Each subsequent horizontal strand should be above the last. When done, you should have three turns of rope looped vertically and cinched loosely by three horizontal wraps. Do not pull tight, these wraps need to be loose. Finish the horizontal turns by creating a loop, with the remainder of the rope, going through the three vertical strands. Here, you’re taking your final turn and passing through the middle, not the outside. [4] X Research source"

Go over the horizontal wraps but between your first three vertical loops. Continue with this motion three times. Weave the rope through the top and out the bottom. You should notice the monkey fist shape coming into place."
