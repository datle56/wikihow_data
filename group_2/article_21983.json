      "content": "Wait until the sunflower begins to wilt. Sunflowers are ready to harvest once the heads become brown. If you have a particularly wet season however, they can go mouldy [if this is the case you will need to cut off the head once the back of it is yellowing and allow the drying process to continue in a greenhouse or shed]. You should prepare them for the drying process once the back of the head begins to turn yellow to yellow-brown. [1] X Research source In order to harvest the seeds, the sunflower head must be completely dry. Otherwise, the flower will not surrender the seeds. A sunflower will reach this state naturally after a few days of beginning to wilt. It is easier to dry sunflowers on the stem if you have dry, sunny weather. If you live in a moist climate, you may want to consider drying them off the stem, instead. At least half of the yellow petals should have dropped before you start preparing the sunflower for harvest. The head of the flower should also begin to droop. It may look dead, but if it still has its seeds, then the sunflower is drying out in a healthy manner. Examine the seeds. Even if they are still stuck on the flower head, they should begin to plump up. The seeds should also be hard and may have their trademark black-and-white striped shell, or purely black, depending on the type of sunflower."

      "title": "Tie a paper bag over the head.",
      "content": "Tie a paper bag over the head. [2] X Research source Cover the head of the flower with a paper bag, tying the bag on loosely with twine or yarn to prevent it from being knocked off. You could also use cheesecloth or similarly breathable fabric, but you should never use a plastic bag. Plastic will restrict the air flow, causing moisture to build up on the seeds. If too much moisture builds up, the seeds may turn rotted or moldy. Tying a bag over the head prevents birds, squirrels, and most other wildlife from sneaking in and \"harvesting\" your sunflower seeds before you do. It also prevents the seeds from dropping to the ground and being lost."

      "title": "Change the bag as needed.",
      "content": "Change the bag as needed. If the bag gets wet or torn, carefully remove it and replace it with a fresh, intact paper bag. You may be able to prevent the bag from getting wet during a rainstorm by temporarily placing a plastic bag over it. Do not tie the plastic bag onto the flower head, though, and remove it as soon as the rain lets up to prevent mold from setting in. Change the paper bag as soon as it gets wet. A wet paper bag is more likely to be torn, and mold may even develop on the seeds if they sit in a wet bag for an extended period of time. Collect any seeds that may have dropped off into the old bag when changing it out. Examine the seeds for signs of possible damage, and if they are in good shape, store them in airtight containers until you are ready to harvest the remaining seeds. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut off the heads. Once the back of the flower heads turn brown, cut them off and prepare to harvest the seeds. Leave roughly 1 ft (30.5 cm) of stem attached to the flower head. Make sure that the paper bag is still securely tied onto the flower head. If it slips off as you remove and transport the sunflower head, you may lose a significant number of seeds."

      "content": "Prepare yellowed sunflowers for drying. Sunflowers are ready to be dried once the back of the head begins to turn a deep yellow to yellow-brown. The sunflower head must be dried before you collect the seeds. Sunflower seeds are easy to remove when dry, but nearly impossible to remove when still moist. Most of the yellow petals should have dropped off by this point, and the head may begin to droop or wilt. The seeds should feel hard when tapped and should also have a black-and-white striped appearance, or perhaps all black, depending on the type of sunflower. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the head with a paper bag.",
      "content": "Cover the head with a paper bag. Secure a brown paper bag over the head of the sunflower using twine, yarn, or string. Do not use a plastic bag. Plastic will not allow the flower head to \"breathe,\" so moisture may build up inside the bag in excess. If this happens, the seeds could rot or develop mold, making them unfit for consumption. If you do not have brown paper bags, you could use a cheesecloth or other similarly breathable fabric. By drying the sunflower off the stem, you do not need to worry about animals eating the seeds before you can get to them. You still need to place the bag over the sunflower head for the sake of collecting loose seeds, though."

Hang the sunflower by tying a piece of twine, yarn, or string to the base of the head and attaching the other end of the twine to a hook, rod, or hanger. The sunflower should dry stem-side up and head-side down. Dry the sunflower in a warm, dry location indoors. The area should have good ventilation to prevent moisture from building up. You should also hang the sunflower head high above the ground or floor to prevent rodents from nibbling at them."

The drying process takes an average of one to four days, but it may take a little longer depending on how early you harvest the flower head and the conditions in which the flower dries. Do not remove the bag until you are prepared to harvest the seeds. Otherwise, you may drop and lose many of the seeds."

You could also dry the seeds on multiple layers of paper towel instead of a single thick towel. Either way, they should be flat and in a single layer so that each seed can dry completely. As you spread the seeds out, you should remove any debris or other foreign matter you notice. You should also remove any damaged seeds.

Soak the seeds overnight in a solution made from 2 quarts (2 liters) of water and 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) salt. Alternatively, you could also boil the seeds in this salt water solution for two hours instead of soaking them overnight. Drain the seeds on dry, absorbent paper towel. Spread the seeds out in a single layer on a shallow baking sheet. Roast for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown, at an oven temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius).
