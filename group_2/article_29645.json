      "title": "Get at least 25 ft (7.6 m) of thin rope or twine.",
      "content": "Get at least 25 ft (7.6 m) of thin rope or twine. For a standard planter about 10 in (25 cm) high, you’ll need each piece of rope to be 100 in (250 cm), or a little more than 8 ft (2.4 m) long. Get at least 25 ft (7.6 m) of 3 ⁄ 16 in (0.48 cm) cotton rope. Most hardware or craft stores have rolls of rope for just a few dollars, so this shouldn’t be hard to find. [1] X Research source You could also use a different type of rope for this activity. Jute or polyester are popular choices. Also look for colored rope if you want to be more decorative. Make sure the rope is thin enough for you to tie knots with. If it’s too thick, it won’t work for this project."

      "title": "Cut 3 sections of rope 100 in (250 cm) long.",
      "content": "Cut 3 sections of rope 100 in (250 cm) long. Unroll the rope and measure out 100 in (250 cm), then cut the rope. Repeat this to get 3 equal pieces. [2] X Research source It’s always best to cut each strand a bit longer so you have plenty of room to work. You can always trim away any excess when you’re finished. The original length of the rope will give you a hanger a little less than half as long. 100 in (250 cm) of rope will give you a planter about 4 ft (1.2 m) long. If you want it shorter or longer, you can adjust the rope length. 80 in (200 cm), for example, will give you a 40 in (100 cm) hanger, or a little over 3 ft (0.91 m). You could also use 4 strands, or even more, depending on the look you're going for. The process isn't much different. You'd just have to tie a few more knots if you have more rope.

      "content": "Hold the 3 pieces of rope together and insert them through the opening in a carabiner together. Pull the pieces through until you reach the halfway point. [4] X Research source Fold the rope so you have 6 individual strands in total. Remember that the number of strands will be different if you use more rope. You could also use a plain metal ring if you don’t have a carabiner."

      "title": "Tie a knot with all the strands just below the carabiner.",
      "content": "Tie a knot with all the strands just below the carabiner. Hold all 6 strands in one hand. Then loop the carabiner around them and pull it to make a knot. Make sure it’s tight so all the strands are held together. [5] X Research source Try to get this knot as close to the carabiner as possible. Feel free to undo the knot and try again if you have to. If you're using more strands, then make sure you loop all of them into a knot. Don't leave any sticking out. For a more decorative approach, you could also tie colored string below the carabiner to hold the strands together. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay the strands out flat and divide them into 3 groups of 2. It’ll be much easier to work on the hanger this way. Lay the rope out on a long table or the floor. Spread each strand out straight. Then group them into 3 pairs of 2 by pairing each strand with the one next to it. [7] X Research source For this project, the pairs would be the 1st and 2nd strands, the 3rd and 4th strands, and the 5th and 6th strands. You'll have more pairs if you use more pieces of rope. For example, if you used 4 pieces instead of 3, then you'll have 4 pairs. [8] X Research source Some people prefer to work on the planter while it’s hanging. In this case, you can hang it up by the carabiner and tie the rope afterward."

Then take the first pair and loop them around each other to make a simple knot. Repeat this for the other 2 pairs of rope. [9] X Research source Make sure each knot is at the same height or your hanger will be uneven. These knots are where the top of your planter will rest, so you can adjust the height if you want to."

Once again, take your ruler or tape measure and measure 5 in (13 cm) down from the knots you just tied. This time, don’t tie together each pair. Instead, tie the 2nd and 3rd strands together. Then tie the 4th and 5th strands together as well. This creates a tiered hanger for more support and decoration. [10] X Research source These knots are about where the middle of the planter will sit. If you’re not liking the height for your hanger so far, you can always untie the knots and make adjustments."

[11] X Research source This pattern will be a bit different if you use more strands for your hanger. If there are 4 pieces and 8 strands, for example, then you'd tie the 1st and 8th ones together.

Loop them around each other and pull to make a knot at the bottom of the hanger. [13] X Research source Make sure this knot is tight. If it comes undone, the planter will fall. You could also use less space in between the knots and add more for decoration. You can try this if you make more than 1 hanger."
