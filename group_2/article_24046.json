[3] X Research source The height of plastic lawn edging varies across brands. It typically ranges from 3–6 in (7.6–15.2 cm) high. Generally, 3 in (7.6 cm) edging is inexpensive and widely available, yet short enough for the grass rhizomes to easily grow into the garden bed, while 6 in (15 cm) is more expensive and difficult to find, yet will make garden bed maintenance easier in the long run.

      "content": "Dig a 3–6 in (7.6–15.2 cm) deep trench around the garden bed. Use a shovel to dig a neat trench around the whole bed where the plastic edging will go. Dig to the depth of the leading you plan to use. Keep the soil that you have dug up close by, as you'll be using it again soon. [6] X Research source The width of the trench must be slightly larger than the width of the edging. Although it depends on the width of your particular edging, approximately 2 in (5.1 cm) is normally sufficient. [7] X Research source You can use a rototiller rather than a shovel if you prefer. [8] X Research source Make sure you dig the trench deep enough so the plastic edging doesn't stick up out of the ground. If the edging sticks up too much, you could hit it with your lawn mower and cause damage. [9] X Expert Source Jeremy Yamaguchi Lawn Care Specialist Expert Interview. 21 January 2020."

Firmly push the connector down onto each end so that it feels sturdy and attached. [15] X Research source With an 8 in (20 cm) long connecter, 4 in (10 cm) from each end of edging will be used.
