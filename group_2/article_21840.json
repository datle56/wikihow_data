      "content": "Position state or city flags to the American flag's right. Hang the American flag so it is to the left (as the observer, facing the flag) of any other flag. Since the flag’s own right (or the observer’s left) is the position of prominence, any state, city, or other organization’s flag should be displayed to the observer’s right. [3] X Research source It’s acceptable to hang other flags at the same height as the American flag as long as they’re on the correct side."

Instead, you'll have to use enough push pins on all sides to distribute the flag’s weight evenly. That way, it won't fall, get torn, or sag. Insert push pins carefully to avoid piercing the flag’s stitching."

Contact your local organization for more information. In America, the rules are vague on how to properly and respectfully retire a flag. The only rule specifically stated is to not cut the blue area with the 50 stars as it would symbolize the splitting of the union."
