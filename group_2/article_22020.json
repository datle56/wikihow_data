      "title": "Use music",
      "content": "Use music . Put on some music that has catchy, relaxing tunes. Never use music or songs that have lyrics to them; they will divert your attention from and take your mind off of studying (unless you can zone out lyrics). [2] X Research source Something in the electronic music genres such as pop or jazz is also great for this. If you do not like music, you can keep thinking about a favorite scene in a book or movie that you like."

      "title": "Keep snacks close.",
      "content": "Keep snacks close. Get together some healthy snacks to nibble on as you study. Allowing yourself a little nibble every now and then helps the study time to pass more pleasantly. Also, it is often effective if you use snacks as a form of treat for yourself every time you complete a part of the work. Don't have a huge bag of chips - try to have something simple such as an apple or banana. Vitamin B is great but an occasional treat is okay like hard candy is fine because you don't need attention about that. Something with a lot of B vitamins such as nuts are great for studying because B vitamins are great for brain fun hours, no matter what. Decorate your spot with favorite things like postcards, knick-knacks, figurines, notes from friends etc. Even temporary spaces can be decorated with bits and pieces you keep in a portable box. But, try not to make your study area too distracting. The less clutter in your study area, the better. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Provide good lighting and a comfortable chair which is at the right height for the desk. Nothing makes study more difficult than feeling uncomfortable as you sit and not being able to read the work properly. This is especially true in the winter months. It is also good to study near a window or natural light because that will have a bigger boost in energy than artificial light. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Ensure adequate ventilation. Nothing sends a person to sleep faster than lack of air. Get fresh air into your room regularly - even in winter! Make sure it circulates, even if this means using a fan in winter to blow around warm air; this is better than stale, stagnant air. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Have good temperature levels.",
      "content": "Have good temperature levels. Being too hot or too cold will make studying hard and you'll be tempted to crawl off to somewhere more comfortable. Turn the heating on or the cooling if you can. If you can't, then improvise and do what most students have always done to heat and cool: open or close windows & doors; use a red heat lamp at your feet (uses a lot less electricity); use a blanket; remove or put on extra layers; drink hot or cold drinks; put on a fan etc."

[6] X Research source Your supplies can encourage you to study - a pen that feels just right in your hand, paper that is so soft the pen glides over it, a book stand that stops your book from slumping over, a row of colored highlighters begging to be used and a scented eraser that smells delicious. Think of the things that you enjoy having around you at study time and make these your little props for amusing yourself with during the study. Don't let them distract you from the study though!"

      "title": "Schedule time slots for study and other times for play.",
      "content": "Schedule time slots for study and other times for play. Don't make your study a never-ending process. Give it its time slot and devote yourself to it during this times and then reward yourself with the things you really feel like doing afterwards. Use the study time effectively, don't doodle, feel sorry for yourself or call up friends. That just stretches out the pain and increases your lack of interest. Assign the tasks to be done, do them and then forget about it and go and do the other stuff that you feel like doing. Also if you wanted to you could take a longer break and in the summer go start an ice cold lemonade stand and have friends help you enjoy yourself. Once it's time to come back in you can feel good and finish your studies while feeling good about your self.

      "title": "Look at your study from a different perspective.",
      "content": "Look at your study from a different perspective. Maybe it's study in an area you really dislike or you just don't care about. Try to think outside the actual pages before you and put the topic into a wider perspective. Think of the sorts of careers people have using this study topic; think of how everyday problems are solved using the techniques that the study is requiring of you. This can help to enliven otherwise dull matter and can also impress a teacher if you show how this knowledge applies elsewhere in some way. It demonstrates application to the topic in spite of your reservations. And hopefully, it also helps to chase away the boredom of it."

      "content": "Realize that study is about more than the topic before you. Sure, it might not grab you the same way that a basketball game outdoors would or a TV show you're missing because of the study. All the same, you're learning coping skills. You're learning how to prioritize, how to be patient and how to deal with something you don't like or feel disinterested in. Perhaps it doesn't feel like it at the time but these are some of life's most important skills because you'll come up against the temptation to fall into boredom many times - during work, a meeting, ceremonies, even parties! You're also learning about the general way the world works and where you might best slot into it yourself. How can you be sure you do or don't want to do things in life unless you know about them first?"

Purring cats provide a great source of rhythmical comfort that can ease the studying time and a fish swimming around and around can do wonders for reminding you that it's worth studying so that you can become a bigger fish in a sea of many. And some of you may be thinking wait a minute what about dogs... well dogs are great companions for studying if they are trained they should be quiet when you are hard at work and playful when you are ready for a break.

If she goes to the apple orchard and picks 5 times the amount of apples she already has, but drops 3 on the way home how many apples she have now? Isn't that a boring problem? You can make it more interesting. For example: Mr. Gidget has 5 bubbles. He goes to the magical bubble island and his friend Mr. Gadget gives him 5 times the amount of bubbles he already has. If Mr. Gidget drops 3 of the bubbles into a pit filled with needles, how many bubbles does he have? Isn't that better? If you use funny names, objects you like, or made-up places, the problem is 10 times more interesting, making it more likely that you will solve it. [12] X Research source"

Chances are is there will be some sort of relevant song. You might want to start with the Animaniacs (e.g., Nations of the World, Wakko's America, and Multiplication). If you are the creative type take a song and wipe out all the lyrics and put your study material in there and sing it to the tune of your chosen song. If you just sing their songs to yourself it can help you to ace that test! Be sure to print out the lyrics to the songs and make it a point to sing the song at least once a night so you'll remember it."
