      "content": "Do an image and information search on the Internet for \"Stinging Nettle\" or Urtica dioica . The latter name will give you the best results of what stinging (or common) nettle looks like in order to better help you identify the species out in the field. Also, some extra information to know may be useful: U. dioica is known by several other common names, including \"Common Nettle\", \"Bigsting Nettle\", \"Tall Nettle\", and \"Slender Nettle.\" There are actually 35 to 40 different species in the Urtica genus in Family Urticaceae . All true nettles are a part of the Nettle Family Urticaceae . There are many other species of plants with the common name \"nettle\" attached to it, but may not be part of the aforementioned taxonomical family. One such exemplary species is Hemp Nettle, Galeopsis tetrahit , which actually belongs to the Mint Family, Lamiaceae . It may be of interest to note that not all species of stinging nettle have literal stinging properties. There are six subspecies of stinging nettle, five of which have stinging properties. This species, along with its subspecies, is distributed all over the world, from Africa to Europe and in North and South America. Stinging nettle is native to western North America, Europe, Asia, northern Africa, and introduced elsewhere. The medicinal properties of nettles were first harnessed in medieval Europe. The plant has been shown to cleanse the body of metabolic waste and increase production of red blood cells. Even today, nettles are steamed and dried for stews and tea. However, this plant is often also seen as a noxious weed that dominates disturbed areas in or near forests, or in clearings with moist, fertile soil."

      "content": "Take a look at the entire plant. Stinging nettle is primarily single-stalked, and a perennial. A single plant you may find in an area will have been borne from a seed, whereas a group of plants are typically from rhizomatous colonies. The perennial nature of stinging nettle is due to the growth points found on these rhizomes. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Look at the stems.",
      "content": "Look at the stems. Stinging nettle stems (singular, never branched) can get as tall as about 1.5 feet (0.46 m) to 9 feet (2.7 m). The stems are sharply angled (typically 4-angled), often with bristly-pubescent stinging hairs. [2] X Research source Occasionally the stems may be smooth. Some stinging nettle subspecies may have green stems, whereas other subspecies may have purple stems."

      "title": "Notice the type of root this plant has.",
      "content": "Notice the type of root this plant has. The roots are predominantly rhizomatous, with a parent plant capable of creating large colonies that can expand up to 8.2 feet (2.5 m) in diameter per year. This rhizomatous nature can also make these plants quite long-lived. Some colonies have been found and estimated to be as much as 50 years old or more. While the plants themselves are not long lasting, it's the rhizomatous nature and the pink buds that form on the roots that allow it to proliferate."

They are typically oval to lance-shaped and 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 4.5 inches (11 cm) long, and around 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) to 1.2 inches (3.0 cm) wide. [3] X Research source Both upper and lower surfaces of the leaves are covered in stinging hairs, and have coarsely serrated edges. The stipules (membraneous structures at the base of each leaf) are 0.2 inches (5.1 mm) to 0.5 inches (13 mm) long. Stalks are around 0.4 inches (10 mm) to 0.5 inches (13 mm) long."

The sepals are 0.04 inches (1.0 mm) to 0.08 inches (2.0 mm) long. These flowers come as two types: Male and female. Flowers are wind-pollinated. [4] X Research source Male flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with 4 sepals and 4 stamens. Female flowers are more green, with 4 pubescent (hairy) sepals and 1 pistil."

Leaves are larger than stinging nettle, about 5 inches (13 cm) long and about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) wide, and are arranged alternate along the stem. Leaf size decreases as they ascend the stem. They are typically darker green on top (light below). Leaves have serrated edges, and heart-shaped near the bottom, and lance-shaped closer to the top.

Hemp nettle, in some areas, can be easily confused with stinging nettle because it often grows in the same conditions, and is found in very similar locations as stinging nettle. However, this plant is introduced from Europe, and does it not typically have stinging hairs like the true nettle. Hemp nettle is also a part of Family Lamiaceae , not Urticaceae . Hemp nettle grows shorter than stinging nettle and also has bristly hairs on the stems and leaves. It also has typically wider leaves (though shape ranges from oval to lance-shaped), and has pink, white, or variegated flowers growing from the base of the leaf. The plant itself tends to be a little darker green than stinging nettle. This species is an annual that grows from seed spread from pre-existing hemp nettles, or deposited by animals, and human activity. Hemp nettle has been deemed a noxious weed in some parts of North America."

Plants are generally shorter than stinging nettle, reaching only 4 feet (1.2 m) tall at the most. However, wood nettle is distinguished by its larger and wider leaves. These leaves are generally 6 inches (15 cm) long and about 4 inches (10 cm) wide. They appear almost egg-shaped or oval, though like stinging nettle has a sharp tip and is serrated at the edges. Leaves have a wrinkled appearance, especially at emergence; this becomes less so as the leaves reach maturity. Leaves are alternate along the stem, unlike stinging nettle which has opposite leaf arrangement. [8] X Research source Flower clusters are droopy like stinging nettle, but they are born on cymes (branching flower clusters) at the top of the plant. Male flowers are borne from the axils of the leaves, whereas female flowers are at the top of the plant. Wood nettle will have branching flower clusters at the top of the plant, unlike stinging nettle."

This plant grows shorter than stinging nettle (only from 1 foot (0.30 m) to 2 feet (0.61 m) tall), and while the leaves are opposite, they are also smaller, more lanceolate or oval-shaped, and have toothed margins that point toward the leaf tips.

The most interesting and defining characteristic of this plant is the translucency of the stems (particularly as plants get older, or as the growing season progresses), hence the common name. Stems may be reddish-green, grey-green or light-green in appearance. It grows shorter than stinging nettle (growing as high as only 0.5 feet (0.15 m) to 2 feet (0.61 m) tall), and leaves and stems are hairless, smooth, and with a shiny appearance. Leaves are smaller, 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) long and half as wide. Each leaf has a thin, membraneous texture (as in they feel smooth almost like human skin) with a prominent mid-vein and two visible side-veins, one on either side of that main vein. Clearweed leaves are more oval or ovate. [12] X Research source Flowers of clearweed are in narrow racemes that are shorter than stinging nettle, at only about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. There is also some branching on each flowering stem."
