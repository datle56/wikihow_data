      "content": "Peel and grate the carrots. Wash two carrots and use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. You can discard the peels. Grate the carrots against the narrow sides of a box grater to shred the carrots finely. [1] X Research source If you don't have organic carrots, try to use homegrown carrots instead."

      "content": "Place the grated carrots in a slow cooker with oil. Get out a small slow cooker that's between one and two quarts (0.9 to 1.9 liters) in size. Transfer the grated carrots into the slow cooker and pour enough oil to cover the carrots. You can use a neutral oil such as olive, coconut, sunflower, or untoasted sesame. [2] X Research source For example, if you have a one-quart (0.9 liter) slow cooker, you'll probably need to use about 2 1/4 cups (540 ml) of oil."

The oil should start to turn orange as it infuses. [3] X Research source If your slow cooker has a warm setting, use that instead of low."

      "content": "Wash and slice the carrots. Get out one bunch of carrots. You should have six to eight fresh carrots. Wash them well to remove any dirt and trim off the green ends. Use a sharp knife to slice them into rounds that are about 1/8-inch (3-mm) thick. [6] X Research source You can discard the leafy ends or save them for a different recipe."

Add the carrot slices and let them boil for three minutes. Turn off the heat and use a slotted spoon to scoop the carrots directly into the icy water in the bowl next to the stove. [7] X Research source Submerging the carrots in the ice water will stop them from cooking and help them keep their bright orange color."

Drain the carrots and lay all of the carrot slices on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Leave space between each carrot slice so air can circulate and dry out the carrots.
