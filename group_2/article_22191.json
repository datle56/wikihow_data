      "content": "Practice weekly exfoliation treatments for beautiful skin. Exfoliation removes dry, dead skin cells that keep your face looking dull and uneven. Dead skin cells don't reflect light like fresh skin does, leaving you without a healthy shine. Whether you use a scrub cleanser, mask, or washcloth, be sure to consistently exfoliate. Be gentle when exfoliating by applying light pressure and using circular motions. Also, always stop when your skin starts to feel uncomfortable. It is best to limit exfoliation to once a week, especially if you have sensitive skin."

      "content": "Stop touching and tugging at your face. There are certain times when it is impossible not to touch your face, but it is important to limit how much contact happens. Every time you put your chin in your palm, pop a pimple or even rub your tired eyes after a long day, you are damaging your skin. Our hands clog our pores with dirt and oil and all of those rubs and tugs create fine lines, wrinkles, and micro tears on our faces."

      "content": "Be consistent with face moisturizer. No matter what your skin type is, you should be using a facial moisturizer to hydrate and nourish your skin. When choosing the best face lotion, find products with all-natural ingredients that are oil-free. This will give your skin the benefits of essential botanicals like aloe vera, but it won't clog your pores.

These ingredients are extra hydrating. [4] X Expert Source Kaveri Karhade, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 11 January 2021. Use a hydrating lotion within two minutes after getting out of the shower or bath because the skin becomes porous and better absorbs lotion. When applying, be gentle and make sure you rub the lotion in completely. Don't forget to use the lotion on your neck too. Dry winters, air conditioners, makeup, and wind can all lead to dry skin, so make sure you replenish your face with moisturizer every day."

The sun causes wrinkles, dark spots, and skin cancer that will slowly develop over time. An easy way to wear sunscreen every day is to buy a face lotion that also has sunscreen in it. Look for lightweight lotions that use natural ingredients. Lotions that contain sunscreen are easy to wear underneath your regular makeup and will give you the protection you need. Use a sunscreen that contains at least SPF 30. [5] X Expert Source Kaveri Karhade, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 11 January 2021."

      "content": "Don’t pack on too much makeup. Certain foundations and bronzers can be very thick, causing dry skin and clogged pores. These products can also use unnatural ingredients that tamper with the skin's natural chemical balances, causing uneven complexions. The best method to create an even skin tone with makeup is by using a lightweight tinted moisturizer. It will give you the natural-looking coverage you crave and also hydrate your skin. Remember to always wash your face at night and remove all traces of makeup to keep skin clean and clear."

      "content": "Cover your dark circles with an under-eye concealer. The skin underneath your eyes is very thin and sensitive, and this often leads to dark circles that can make you look tired. To help them blend in with your regular skin tone, lightly apply an under-eye concealer to disguise discoloration. These concealers contain green undertones that help cancel out the purple hues underneath your eyes. [6] X Research source Rub your finger in the eye concealer and dab it under your eyes. Always start from the outside corner of your eye and work your way in to prevent wrinkles. Never rub the skin under your eye when applying. This will also lead to wrinkles and broken capillaries, which can cause even darker circles."

      "content": "Experiment with face contouring. You can play up or play down certain features on your face with a brush, brown bronzer, and a makeup highlighter. Contouring can help your cheekbones stand out, redefine your jawline, or even make your nose look smaller. Contouring can be tricky at first, so to help you along, try watching a makeup tutorial to get you started. [7] X Research source Makeup highlighters are used to bring attention to features that you want people to focus on such as your cheekbones or jawline. Bronzers help to shape under your cheekbones to slim down a face. Begin with a brush that has lightly been brushed into the bronzer. Dust off the extra bronzer and start by applying the brush at your temples and working your way down to your cheekbones using circular motions. Keep going until you reach the middle of your jawline and then stop. This is an easy step to give you beautiful cheeks."

      "content": "Wear mascara to open up your eyes. Black mascara is flattering on everyone and is easy to apply. It pumps up thin lashes and helps lengthen short ones. For a softer look, you can try using a brown mascara. After you apply mascara, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler that will open your eyes up even more. Don't apply more than one coat of mascara because it will begin to clump up and make you look unkempt. Keep it simple with one coat and wash the mascara off every night."
