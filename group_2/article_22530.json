      "content": "Find a pants size that feels the most comfortable. Try on a wide variety of sizes before you decide on what pair to purchase. If a pair of jeans feels too small or too large, simply try the next size up or down. Ask the sales assistant to see if the sizing may change when the jeans are washed, as this could mean that you need to pick a different size.

These jeans are the most flattering shape if you have concerns about your tummy. [5] X Research source Avoid wearing low-rise jeans.

      "content": "Check that the jeans have firm fabric around the belly. While you are wearing the jeans, check how the fabric feels against your tummy.

Best of all, sewn-in waistbands are hidden, so no one will know your secret! All types of jeans, from mid-rise to high-rise jeans, are designed with stretchy waistbands."

Pick jeans that are plain and simple around the fly and pockets, as this part of the jeans is closest to the area that you are trying to draw attention away from. When you choose jeans with a simple zipper, your belly won’t be accentuated. Instead, you’ll draw attention to your overall body shape for a more streamlined look.

It’s best to try on shapewear in store rather than purchasing it online so that you can ensure that the size is right for you.

      "content": "Avoid wearing a belt around your hips. For a more “cinched” look that doesn’t create any belly bulge, wear high-waisted jeans. Try wearing the belt at different heights along your torso to find the place that is the most flattering for your shape. Aim to wear your belt around the slimmest part of your torso, which may be your high waist or your low waist, depending on your figure. [17] X Research source If your jeans need a belt to stay on, they are too big for you. Go for a smaller size that fits you more snugly. Belts that go around your waist work especially well with asymmetrical prints."
