      "title": "Open a new catheter tip syringe.",
      "content": "Open a new catheter tip syringe. To prevent infection, only use an unopened, sterile catheter tip syringe unless directed otherwise by your clinician. To make sure that the syringe remains sterile, do not allow the tip of the syringe to touch your skin or any other object. You'll need to use a 60cc catheter-tipped syringe for this. It may also be called a Toomey syringe. [1] X Expert Source Robert Dhir, MD Board Certified Urologist & Urological Surgeon Expert Interview. 12 October 2020. Catheter tip syringes can be purchased at most medical supply stores, drug stores, and supermarkets. They are typically sold in multi-syringe bundles for less than $1 per individual unit."

      "title": "Draw saline into the syringe.",
      "content": "Draw saline into the syringe. Place the tip of your syringe into a bottle of normal saline solution. Then, pull back on the plunger of the syringe. Continue pulling the plunger until you have filled the syringe with the amount of saline prescribed by your doctor, typically around 60cc. [2] X Expert Source Robert Dhir, MD Board Certified Urologist & Urological Surgeon Expert Interview. 12 October 2020. Look for saline solutions at most medical supply and drug stores. They typically cost between $4 and $9 per bottle. If you can't afford saline solution, use an unopened bottle of water instead. You can also boil tap water, then use it after it's cooled. [3] X Expert Source Robert Dhir, MD Board Certified Urologist & Urological Surgeon Expert Interview. 12 October 2020. Do not use homemade saline solutions since they will increase your chances of infection. While handling the bottle of saline solution, you should only touch the outside of the container. Do not get your fingers on the top or inside of the bottle."

Gently pull the plunger back to check for excess urine. If you draw urine into the syringe, continue pulling to remove the urine currently inside the catheter. Remove as much urine as possible before continuing. Try to suction out any sediment or clots as you do this.
