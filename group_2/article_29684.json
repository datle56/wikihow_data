      "content": "Use a specialty prank calling app as a super easy option. Companies like Prank Dial and Ownage Pranks have pre-recorded prank messages that you can send to any phone number that you’d like. Simply choose the message and type in the person’s number to get the call going. Check out other hilarious apps like: Boomerang JokesPhone Pranky (iOS only) Some apps might ask you to include a phone number to send the prank call from.

      "title": "Dial *67",
      "content": "Dial *67 before typing in the person’s phone number to keep yourself anonymous. This simple code removes your caller ID from the other person’s phone as you make your call—plus, it’s totally free, and it works with most phone numbers. [1] X Research source Example: If the person’s phone number is 123-555-6789, you’d type *671235556789 into your phone."

      "title": "Download a “burner” app or service that gives you a fake phone number.",
      "content": "Download a “burner” app or service that gives you a fake phone number. These apps download directly to your phone, so you can make a call without exposing your phone number in the process. Some apps are free, while others offer a free trial: [2] X Research source Google Voice (free) Burner (free trial) Hushed (free trial)"

      "content": "Use a spoofing app to disguise your caller ID. Spoofing services change the way your caller ID looks on someone else’s phone without requiring you to get an actual burner phone. SpoofCard offers free and simple spoofing services that keep you anonymous while you pull the perfect prank. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Make your prank call with a friend’s phone.",
      "content": "Make your prank call with a friend’s phone. Let your friend know what you’re up to and see if they’re interested in doing you a solid. Just keep in mind that borrowing a friend’s phone comes with a higher risk, since they’ll be on the hook for any unhappy prank call victims. [4] X Research source You can always steal your friend’s phone when they aren’t looking—just be ready to deal with the consequences!"

      "title": "Dial from a pay phone.",
      "content": "Dial from a pay phone. Pay phones aren’t totally anonymous, but they still make you harder to pin down. Look for a payphone in town and prepare to make your call —the recipient can trace back the payphone number, but they won’t be able to know who was using it. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Buy a prepaid cellphone.",
      "content": "Buy a prepaid cellphone. Prepaid cell phones, also known as burners, are sold at most gas stations—best of all, you don’t need to provide any personal info to use them. They are equipped with GPS, though, so you can be traced if you’re using one at home. [6] X Research source Burner phones aren’t super expensive, but they can add up over time. If you’re a frequent prankster, they aren’t an ideal solution."

      "title": "Plan and practice your ruse ahead of time.",
      "content": "Plan and practice your ruse ahead of time. Write down the basics of what you want to say so you can sound super confident and convincing, since any stuttering and stammering will make it really obvious that the call is a prank. If you’re running low on inspiration, try one of these ideas: [7] X Research source Craigslist Prank: Either place a joke ad on Craigslist or prank call someone who includes their phone number on an ad. 3-Way Calls: Set up a 3-way call with 2 random numbers and stay silent on your end of the line. The other callers will be super confused about how the call got set up. SFX: Pull up a silly soundboard and play funny SFX and voice lines into your phone when the other person picks up."

      "title": "Keep the prank call short.",
      "content": "Keep the prank call short. Try to cap off your joke or ruse so it doesn’t go on for more than a few minutes. Silly, short pranks are pretty harmless, but most people don’t have the time or patience to put up with really long phone calls. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Stifle your laughter",
      "content": "Stifle your laughter to make the call more convincing. Yes, your prank is totally hilarious—but bursting into giggles at the get-go kills your shot at landing the punchline. If possible, toggle the mute button on your phone to keep any stray snickers from sneaking through. [9] X Research source Try to get your laughs out of your system before you dial any numbers."

      "title": "Deliver the prank as playfully as possible.",
      "content": "Deliver the prank as playfully as possible. You’re calling someone as a way to kill time and have a laugh, so just relax and have fun with it! The more serious you are, the less enjoyable your prank call will be. [10] X Research source Some people might interpret a serious tone of voice as a threat, even if you’re just pulling a prank. Keeping your voice light, silly, and fun helps prevent any miscommunication."

      "title": "Call actual people, not emergency services.",
      "content": "Call actual people, not emergency services. Prank calling 911, the fire department, or local police is never a good idea and can get you into some serious trouble. [11] X Research source Instead, focus your pranks on specific people or businesses so you don’t get in the way of actual emergencies. Don’t prank emergency hotlines, either. Calling a hotline when you're not in a crisis causes major stress and frustration for volunteers trying to help legitimate callers."

      "content": "Prank-call someone who lives pretty far away from you. Let’s say you prank someone a few neighborhoods away. The person gets upset and calls the police, who easily trace your number in the area and track you down. That’s no good! The further you are from the prank-called person, the less effort the police will put in to track you down. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid police impersonations to stay out of legal trouble. Your chances of getting traced increase a lot if you impersonate law enforcement, and you can get in big trouble for doing it. It just takes one call to the actual police station or law enforcement agency to expose your ruse. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your prank calls light-hearted and threat-free. Prank calling with the intention to spread fear such as bomb threats and active shooters will be investigated by law enforcement and you will be held accountable. Even joking about a threat is risky—when people feel threatened, emergency services and police officers get involved pretty quickly. [14] X Research source Instead, play it safe by keeping your pranks silly and harmless. Never report a fake crime or emergency at someone else’s home. This is known as “swatting,” and can get you arrested or even thrown in jail. [15] X Research source Don’t ask for people’s personal information (like their credit card info), even as a joke. People might assume that you’re trying to scam them and get the police involved."

      "content": "Call a number just once instead of dialing it over and over again. If the person picks up, great! If they don’t, move on to another number. Repeated phone calls qualify as harassment, which can get you in trouble with the local police. You definitely don’t want that! [16] X Research source"

In California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Washington, recording a phone call without the other person’s permission is illegal. If you live in these states, make sure to switch off any recording devices before placing your call. [17] X Research source If you do record your prank call, don’t post it on social media or send it on blast to a bunch of people. This qualifies as an “invasion of privacy,” and you could be sued in civil court. [18] X Research source"
