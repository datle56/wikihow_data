This will enable you to grow more muscle mass more quickly. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source While this method will get you more size, it won't necessarily get you more strength than you would get if you used a different order because you're not changing the exercises or amount of resistance."

      "content": "Increase the number of arm-training sessions each week. To grow your biceps fast, you need to work them more often. At the same time, you want to leave time for rest, since this is when your muscles repair and grow. This could mean that you include two arm-training sessions each week instead of just one. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also build up the number of sets you do each week. A total of 20 or 30 sets per week produces optimal growth."

      "title": "Develop your mind-muscle connection.",
      "content": "Develop your mind-muscle connection. Focusing on your muscles as you're working out actually increases growth. When you're lifting weights, focus on squeezing your biceps rather than simply lifting the weight. [4] X Research source As you're doing an exercise, try not to think about the exercise itself or your form. Instead, think about what the muscle is doing. Direct your motions based on the muscle movement rather than your physical movement. For example, instead of thinking about lifting your body to do a chin-up, you would think about contracting your biceps. It can take some practice to adjust your focus. However, if you maintain this connection, you could grow your biceps twice as fast as you would otherwise be able to."

      "title": "Use your full range of motion in all exercises.",
      "content": "Use your full range of motion in all exercises. You'll get significantly larger size and strength increases if you extend your arm through its full range of motion rather than using only a partial range of motion. You also stretch the muscle completely, ensuring that your growth is even. [5] X Research source For example, when you're doing curls , contract your triceps muscle at the bottom of each rep to make sure your biceps are fully lengthened."

      "title": "Push your repetitions past muscle failure.",
      "content": "Push your repetitions past muscle failure. You've probably heard the phrase \"no pain, no gain.\" If you want to build muscle mass quickly, the intensity of your workouts matters just as much as anything else. Continue sets until you can no longer do the exercise, then try to do one more set. [6] X Research source If you can't do a full set, even a couple of reps can be enough to build larger biceps. This type of training can be extremely painful and also dangerous. When your muscles are fully fatigued, you are at greater risk of injury, especially if you can't maintain proper form. Make sure you have a spotter if you're working out past muscle failure."

      "title": "Warm up",
      "content": "Warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before lifting weights. Warm up your entire body by cycling on a stationary bicycle at a moderate pace or walking on a treadmill. Dynamic stretches, such as lunges, can also help warm up your body. Then, do a run-through of your routine using an extremely light weight or just your body weight. [7] X Research source You only need to do a few reps of each exercise as a warmup. For example, if you're planning to do 5 sets of 10 reps, 5 reps would be enough for a warmup. For example, you might do dumbbell curls without the dumbbell, just following the same motion, or using a light hand weight."

      "content": "Start with seated dumbbell curls to work your biceps to fatigue. Sit on the edge of a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing inward. Contract your arms to lift the weights, turning your wrists so that your palms are facing upward. Keep your elbows pinned to your sides. Squeeze your biceps hard when you reach the top of your range of motion, then lower the weights back to the starting position in a slow, controlled way. [8] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 October 2019. You can also alternate arms rather than doing both arms at once, which gives each arm a little bit of rest in between reps. However, you'll typically have to do a lot more reps if you alternate to work your biceps to fatigue. Grip the dumbbell as far to the side next to your thumb as possible, rather than in the middle, to maximize the use of your biceps during curls. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Move on to concentration curls to isolate your biceps. Still sitting on the end of a flat bench, spread your legs wide apart with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in one hand with your palm up and lean forward, pressing your triceps into your inner thigh. Curl the dumbbell up towards your shoulder, keeping your upper arm perpendicular to the floor. Hold the curl for one second at the top before lowering it slowly with control. [10] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 October 2019. Continue with this exercise until you feel that you can't do more. Then use your other hand to provide enough assistance to do at least 2 or 3 more curls. Then switch and do the other arm."

      "content": "Target the long head of the biceps with alternating hammer curls. Your biceps are made of two parts, the long head and the short head. The long head creates the peak of your biceps and gives it size. [11] X Research source Stand with your feet about hip-width apart and your knees loose. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing inward. Curl one arm towards the opposite shoulder, keeping your elbow locked by your side. Hold the curl at the peak for one second, then lower the dumbbell back to the start in a slow, controlled way. Repeat the same motion with your other arm. Continue alternating until you feel like you can't do any more repetitions. You should be able to do a lot of reps of this exercise because your muscles are getting a brief rest while you alternate arms."

Keep your hands about shoulder-width apart on the bar and lower the weight so it's hanging in front of your thighs. Contract your biceps to curl the bar up to shoulder height, then release it back down slowly with control. Repeat until your muscles are fatigued. [12] X Research source If you want to work different parts of the biceps, experiment with different grips. If you use a close grip with your hands just inside hip-width, you emphasize the long head of the biceps, which forms the peak of the muscle. If you use a wide grip with your hands just outside shoulder-width, you emphasize the short inner head."

While it can be difficult to do chin-ups for reps, a resistance band, wrapped over the bar and under one foot, might make it easier for you to do multiple repetitions of this exercise. [13] X Research source For chin-ups, use an underhand grip (palms facing your body) and start with your arms fully extended. Pull yourself up until your chin is just higher than the bar, then lower yourself down with control. If a chin-up is too difficult for you right now, start with a dead hang; grip the pull-up bar, lift your feet off the ground, and hang with your arms straight for 10 seconds. Reader Poll: We asked 409 wikiHow readers and 57% of them agreed that pull-ups and chin-ups are the most challenging exercises to perform. [Take Poll] So, you should take your time and work your way up to the full exercise."

      "title": "Group your exercises into supersets to build mass.",
      "content": "Group your exercises into supersets to build mass. Combining biceps and triceps routines into supersets produces an antagonistic effect that makes each exercise more effective. To do supersets, do 5 sets of 5 to 10 reps of one exercise, followed by a brief rest (30 seconds or so), then launch directly into 5 sets of the other exercise. [14] X Research source For example, you might do triceps dips followed by chin-ups to work both your triceps and your biceps. Overhead triceps curls followed by biceps curls also make a good superset."

[18] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 October 2019. Talk to your doctor for some pointers on how to gain weight in a healthy way. Ordinarily, you should consume 0.8 grams (0.03 oz) of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.35 grams per pound) each day. However, you want to consume at least 1.2 to 1.7 grams (0.04 to 0.06 oz) of protein for every kilogram of body weight (0.5 to 0.8 grams for every pound) each day to build additional muscle mass. For example, if you weigh 75 kilograms (165 pounds), you would ordinarily need to consume an average of 60 grams (2.1 oz) of protein every day. This means 240 of your daily calories should come from protein to maintain your current body structure. However, if you wanted to build muscle, you would need to increase the protein you consume to between 75 grams (2.6 oz) (300 calories) and 128 grams (4.5 oz) (512 calories)."
