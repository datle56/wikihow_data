      "content": "Feel the rock's weight in your hand to estimate density. Agate is a relatively dense stone, so it should appear to weigh less than it actually does. Hold the stone you think is agate in one hand, and then hold a similar sized stone that you don't think could be agate in your other hand. If the stone you think is agate feels heavier, you may be correct. [3] X Research source This is a relatively inaccurate way of estimating density. If you want to be more exact, you can calculate the density of the stone using a water-displacement method. Agate has a density of 2.6 to 2.64 g/cm3. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Feel for a waxy or glassy texture on the inside of the stone. If you can break open your sample with a hammer and chisel, or if it is already broken, rub your finger along the inside of the stone where the bands of color are. Agate should feel waxy or like glass. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Compare the color and appearance of your stone to known agate samples. To do this, you will have to see the inside of the stone, so you may have to crack it open with a hammer and chisel. Mineralogists characterize agate by the stone's multicolored bands, which can either form concentric circles that grow towards the center or, more rarely, horizontal layers. [6] X Research source Other types of chalcedony stones (jasper, chert) display banding, so you may have to perform other tests in order to make sure what you have is agate."

      "title": "Open the stone with a hammer and chisel if your sample is not already broken open.",
      "content": "Open the stone with a hammer and chisel if your sample is not already broken open. The rough outside of agate will block all light, so you'll have to get it open in order to test the transparency. To crack a bit of stone, place it on a solid, stable surface. Put the pointed end of a chisel up to the stone, and then hit the other end of the chisel with a hammer. It may take a few tries!"

      "title": "Hold your stone sample up to a light source, such as a lamp or flashlight.",
      "content": "Hold your stone sample up to a light source, such as a lamp or flashlight. One of the defining features of agate is its translucent quality. To determine how transparent your sample is (which is also known as its diaphaneity), position the stone so that it comes between the light source and your eye. [7] X Research source Agate does not need to be polished for it to be translucent, so this quality should be apparent in its natural state."

    {
      "title": "Look to see how much light from the source passes through the stone.",
      "content": "Look to see how much light from the source passes through the stone. Agate is translucent, which means that only some of the light passes through. [8] X Research source When you hold the stone up to a light source, the colors of the agate should shine a little and become more clear. If no light shines through, then the stone is opaque. This indicates that your sample is not agate, but most likely is jasper. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Test transparency by holding your agate over an image on paper.",
      "content": "Test transparency by holding your agate over an image on paper. Because agate is translucent, when you hold it over an image of something, the picture should be able to be seen, but it should be slightly blurred. [10] X Research source If you can clearly see through the stone, then your sample is transparent. This may indicate that what you have is not agate, but a different type of quartz crystal."
