[4] X Research source The four best times of day to meditate are first thing in the morning, whenever you’re stressed out, on your lunch break, or at the end of your workday. [5] X Research source Meditating right before bedtime is not recommended, as you are more likely to relax into sleep. With meditation, you want to ensure that you remain fully awake.

Research suggests that in addition to reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, yoga protects the brain from shrinking with age.

Avoid looking at screens (computer, TV, phone, tablet) before bed. [16] X Research source When you sleep, your brain consolidates information into your long-term memory bank.

It’s easy to get stressed out when you can’t find your keys or some important paperwork, or when you walk into your home and feel as though you’re drowning in clutter. Choosing specific places for everything and then consistently putting them away will help reduce the stress in your life, and will keep your mind free to focus on other things (like increasing your memory!). You don’t have to do everything at once. Start with small things like keeping your keys in a tray or hook by the door, or making a commitment to always putting away your coat, shoes, and bag the moment you get home. If you have a lot to do, making a to-do list will help quiet your mind and keep you on track."

If you are trying to memorize a language, pick 10 to 20 words to remember each day, and write each of them out 10 times while saying them out loud. You might even do this a few times until you can write and say each word perfectly, without having to think about it.

Instead of writing yourself a note or starting laundry before you go, you can do something like leave a shoe out in your hallway (if your hallway is usually empty/tidy, that is). Simply seeing that shoe out of place should spark the memory of wanting to do laundry. Associating a concept with a specific picture, person, or image is another great way to boost recall.
