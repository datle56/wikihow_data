If you’re a passionate reader, join a book club, go to public readings, or strike up a conversation with someone who carries novels around with their textbooks. Ask your favorite teachers if they can recommend any academic clubs for you to join! These can include debate teams, clubs for entrepreneurs, or a math quiz team.

      "content": "Spend time around people who show kindness. Finding someone who will treat you well and support you is more important than popularity. Avoid spending time with people who talk bad about others or put them down. Instead, look for people who invite others to sit with them at lunch, who encourage others when they speak up in class, or who are always willing to help when someone needs a hand.

Go to source When you’re around someone, you should feel comfortable acting like yourself around them. A friend should never make you feel bad for being who you are. You may be interested in befriending some of the most popular people in school, but if they are disrespectful to you or to others, they probably won’t be a true friend. You should feel like the other person supports and respects you."

If you don’t have a chance to hang out during the school day, try setting up a group event after school or on the weekends. This can be as informal as walking home together, or it can be a planned activity everyone can participate in. [4] X Research source For instance, you could have your friends start meeting once a week at a local pizza place after school. Each week, encourage your friends to invite as many of their mutual friends as they want. By making it a regular occurrence, you can build new friendships gradually. You could also attend group events like flag football games or even study groups to meet new people."

While making eye contact is an important part of communication, you might be able to learn something by looking at people’s feet, too. Some people believe that groups of people standing in a circle with their feet all pointing to the center are less likely to welcome a new member, but those who have their toes pointing out are more likely to welcome you to join them. [5] X Research source It might sound crazy, but if you’re trying to make new friends, give this a try the next time you see groups of people chatting in the hall, at a party, or at a social event."

If you really want to branch out and find new friends, consider stretching your current experience and trying something entirely new, like an intramural sport. Most schools have a variety of intramural teams, so you should be able to find one that sounds fun to you. Find out when they meet, then attend the next event to inquire about joining. You don’t have to be great at sports to play intramurals. Intramurals could be anything from soccer and flag football to frisbee, golf, and dodgeball. Mostly, they’re designed to be a great way to have a good time, get some exercise, and gain a whole new team of friends."

      "content": "Attend social events like dances and sporting events. Many times, schools will provide opportunities for students to mingle outside of the classroom. Take advantage of these activities when they come up. After all, the more often you cross paths with someone, the more likely you are to become friends with them, since you’ll have more of a chance to get to know them better. Afterschool social events might include school dances, movie nights, mixers, and plays. If you attend sporting events, not only will you build a bond with the other students cheering on the team, but the athletes may appreciate the fact that you came out to support them, especially if it’s a team that doesn’t draw a huge crowd. It can sometimes help to invite someone else to go with you to an event like this, since sitting by yourself can be lonely. Just pick someone you’d like to get to know better and say something like, “Hey, Stephen, I was thinking of the baseball game tonight, do you want to go with me?” Even if they can’t go to that particular event, they’ll remember that you asked them, and they’ll be more likely to consider you as a friend."

If you’re struggling to make friends, you may be completely unaware that you are creating a bubble around yourself that can make it difficult for others to get to you. When you’re walking through the halls, hold your head up high, smile at people when you make eye contact, and talk to others whenever you get the chance. [7] X Research source Talking to other people during the day doesn’t have to involve long conversations with someone you don’t know well. It could be as simple as saying something like, “How are you today?” when you’re standing near someone at your locker, or “Hey, I liked your presentation!” after someone does a good job giving a speech in class. If you feel stuck in a routine that keeps you from interacting with people, try changing things up. For instance, you could try taking a new hall to get to class, which will give you a chance to interact with people you might not see otherwise."

However, you and the other person will both be more comfortable after a simple introduction. Make eye contact with the person, smile, and try to seem warm and relaxed instead of nervous or anxious. Then, break the ice by talking about whatever is going on around you.

If you find yourself sitting near a group and you can hear their conversation, try to find a way to include yourself. Of course, you want to avoid taking over the whole conversation, but if you hear something you can comment, try to overcome your natural shyness and just jump in! This comes in handy in situations like sitting with a new group at lunch or being surrounded by others at a sporting event. Consider asking a question of the entire group rather than just one person. For instance, if the group is talking about an upcoming dance, you could say something like, “I think they should hire a DJ for the next dance. Wouldn’t that be awesome?”"

However, avoid simply asking yes or no questions, since one-word answers don’t necessarily keep a conversation alive. You can ask questions about whatever you’re already talking about, or you can change the subject if you feel that ran its course. [11] X Research source For instance, if you started off by talking about a song that’s playing, you might say something like, “What other bands do you like, to listen to?” You could also say something like, “I haven’t gone to school here very long.

By following up with them, you may be able to build a lasting friendship, as opposed to just having a casual conversation once in a while.

However, avoid texting more than once every few days, especially when you’re just getting to know the person. Call them when you want to reach out on a more personal level. Texting is more casual, but a phone call is nice for a special occasion like the person’s birthday, or if you want to check on the person because they have missed several days of school.

For instance, if you are both into the arts, maybe there is a gallery, museum, play, or band you could go see. Invite your new friend to a movie you both want to see. If there is something you really want to see, ask if they would like to go with you. If you have time, plan to spend time together after the movie so you have a chance to talk about it.
