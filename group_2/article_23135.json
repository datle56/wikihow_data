      "content": "You feel like you’re still single. When your partner isn’t prioritizing you, it’s easy to forget you’re in a relationship. Your partner should make you feel treasured, so it can be heartbreaking to feel like you’re still alone. Try talking to your partner about what’s making you feel so alone, and what you’d like to change. [1] X Research source “Going so long between dates makes me feel like we aren’t a real couple. Could we schedule weekly date nights?” “It makes me sad that we don’t text everyday. Would you be open to increasing our communication?” “Sometimes I feel like we’re still just friends. What does a relationship look like to you?”"

      "content": "Your partner won’t label your relationship. Sometimes people hold off on labels because they’re just having fun. At the same time, your partner might be super into you, but they’re just afraid of commitment . In that case, they may really care for you and value you, even though they’re struggling to label your relationship. Try asking them how they’d prefer to label what you have together. [2] X Research source “I’m having so much fun with you, but we haven’t really talked about labels. I was wondering how you feel about that?” “I was telling my friends about how amazing you are, and I realized I didn’t know what to label you. Would you be comfortable with me calling you my boyfriend?”"

[3] X Research source You deserve a partner who’s attentive to you, so definitely have a heart-to-heart with them about how you feel. “I feel like I’m always there for you when you have a bad day, but I’m not getting the comfort I need from you. Can we talk about this?” “I really need daily check-ins for me to feel good in a relationship.

If your partner expects you to always adjust to fit their schedule, it’s a sign they might not think of you as a priority. Try explaining to them that this arrangement isn’t working for you. [4] X Research source “I’ve realized that you only want to go out when it’s your idea. I’d really like for us to start doing things I like to do. How do you feel about this?” “It seems like all of our dates revolve around your schedule. I’d really appreciate it if we could start making plans that are convenient for both of us.

      "content": "You haven’t met their friends or family. When someone you’re dating won’t introduce you to other people in their life, it’s called “pocketing.” There are several reasons your partner could be pocketing you, and some of them are totally innocent. For instance, maybe they're just worried you won’t be impressed by the other people in their life. [5] X Research source Talk to your partner to see if they’re open to making introductions. “I’d really love to have a group hangout so I can meet your friends. What do you think?” “I’ve been thinking of having a Halloween party so we can get our friend groups together. Thoughts?” “I feel like we’re at the point in our relationship when we should meet each other’s families. What do you think?” Reader Poll: We asked 1015 wikiHow readers who've been in a situationship, and only 12% of them said they realized they weren’t a priority because their partner hasn’t introduced them to friends and family. [Take Poll] While this can definitely be a red flag, there could be other reasons your partner hasn’t introduced you yet. Make sure your partner knows how you feel about the issue before making an assumption."
