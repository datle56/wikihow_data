[1] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022. You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include. These could include buttons, bones, metals, etc. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source [4] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022. If you can, find them already precut into distinct shapes and sizes. This will keep you from having to break them with a hammer/saw later. Choose a wide variety of colors and shades. Even if your work will be mostly monochromatic, you will want varying values and ones. Choose tesserae that goes with the art you wish to create. For example, if you are doing a beach scene, it might be best to use a wide variety of shells. If you are looking to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge, you might want to look into metals."

      "content": "Pick the foundation to adhere the mosaic tiles on. Tables, planters, birdbaths, or walking stones are just a few ideas to use. [5] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022. You can make almost anything work as a base. Wood, terracotta and/or glass are usually what people use as a base. Make sure the base is strong enough to hold the weight of the tesserae and grout. [6] X Research source Choose bases which have large, open spaces and that are solid. [7] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022. If there are numerous crevices on your base, it may be hard to create mosaic pieces which will fit."

      "title": "Clean your base appropriately.",
      "content": "Clean your base appropriately. Every base needs to be cleaned off before you adhere the mosaic tiles down, otherwise they will not stick properly. For most bases, you can simply use water and a basic home cleaner. Scrub the dirt and grim off, and then dry the surface off. Go back over the surface a few more times in case you missed something. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source For metal bases, use sandpaper and a wire brush in order to remove rust. The now \"roughed up\" surface has an added benefit, it will make the tiles stick to the surface better. Score plastic and/or rubber surfaces with a utility knife in order to help the tiles stick better. Sand wood surfaces down, then apply a waterproof sealer. If you don't do this, moisture could soak in, thereby cracking your mosaic art."

      "content": "Find a pattern you wish to make into a mosaic. Find patterns for free online or use your imagination and come up with your own design. For a first time project, you may wish to work with a simple pattern. This could mean a house, a fish, a landscape, or anything else with simply defined shapes. After you work on a simple pattern, you can graduate up to more complicated projects. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Transfer the design to your base.",
      "content": "Transfer the design to your base. Print out the pattern to the dimensions needed. Begin transferring the design, first using a pencil. This will allow you to adjust for mistakes and inconsistencies. Once you have a rough outline with a pencil, go back and trace over the lines with a pen or marker, depending on the type of base. If you are using a basic design, this might be the time to add in details that are not present in the original design. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source If the pattern is extra large, do it in sections. Remember this is a rough outline, which can be changed when you start to lay down specific tiles. If you are using an original design, simply draw it directly onto the base. However, don't over plan. Spontaneity is key to creating artistically stunning art."

      "title": "Cut your mosaic objects into pieces.",
      "content": "Cut your mosaic objects into pieces. In order to get the mosaic \"look\" you will need to create different shapes and sizes of pieces. Remember, before you begin to break your mosaic objects into pieces, you need to be wearing safety goggles, gloves, and an apron. Pick a safe place to cut your objects, like an empty garage, or outdoors in your backyard. If you are just looking to make randomly sized pieces, a basic hammer works best. However, there are some more specialized ways. [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Tile nippers and cutters are used to create straight lines and curves. [16] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022. They can be found at most hardware, and arts and crafts stores. These are used to cut through porcelain, ceramic, china, etc. Cut through the object you are using about halfway through. They, using your hands, break the piece off. Glass nippers and cutters work the same way, except that they are specially designed for cutting glass. When you are creating the pieces, look at your design. Try to envision what shapes you will need in order to fill the pattern. If you miss a piece, or mis-cut one, you can always come back later to cut a new one."

      "title": "Lay your mosaic tesserae overtop of the pattern.",
      "content": "Lay your mosaic tesserae overtop of the pattern. Take each of your new pieces you have created and place them where you will eventually stick them. This is a great opportunity to mix around shapes, sizes and colors. Once you get a basic layout of your pieces, find where the missing pieces are, or where you need a better shaped piece. Then go back and create a new one which better fits the design. [17] X Research source [18] X Research source Once you have your objects laid out the way you want them, you then have two options: leave them there, or take them off. If you choose to leave them there, you will apply mortar directly to the pieces. This garners a more accurate design, but takes a lot longer and can be more tricky. If you choose to take them off, place the pieces to the side in the same pattern they were placed on the base. You will be applying mortar onto the base. This garners a less accurate pattern, but is much easier to accomplish."

Stir the mixture together until the consistency is like thick cottage cheese. Only mix together small amounts as you work, as the mortar mixture cannot be preserved. [19] X Research source"

Use a small knife or scalpel. When you are applying the mortar, wear gloves so that mortar does not stick to your hands. Mortar is basically a type of cement which can be difficult to get off. [20] X Research source If you are applying the mixture to the base, only do one section at a time. Spread on a few inches, length wise, onto the base. You only need about a 1/4 inch width of mortar. If you are applying it to the pieces themselves, take your knife and apply the mixture to the back of the piece. Try to keep most of the mortar adhered to the back by gently pressing the mixture with your hands. Scrape off excess mortar from around the outside edge of the piece before you apply it."

Apply tiles starting in one corner of the design and work across in rows. Make sure you leave enough space between pieces for grout, about 1/8 inch gaps. Every time you lay down a new piece, scrape off any excess mortar which is readily apparent. If you don't, the mortar will solidify and be hard to get off.

The grout should cover the mosaic enough to fill the gaps. Work in small areas at a time and wipe off any excess grout as you go along. Each time you grout around a new piece, give the tesserae a gentle push to make sure the tile sticks to the grout.

After you are done cleaning, let the water sit in the bucket for a while. The grout will sink to the bottom. You can then pour out the water, and dump the grout into a trashcan.

This will coat the tiles and safeguard against damage, especially for outdoor mosaics subjected to fluctuating temperatures and adverse weather conditions. It also will give a high gloss shine that will make the colors stand out. Tile and stone-floor sealers can be purchased at most local hardware stores. [30] X Research source [31] X Research source You will want to apply two coats. Use a paintbrush to apply each coat. In between coats, wait about 10-15 minutes for the varnish to dry. After the sealer has dried, buff the mosaic with a soft towel. This will give your mosaic a nice clean finish. Reapply every few years for added protection."

You can also pack grout onto the edges, using a spatula, for a more textured look."
