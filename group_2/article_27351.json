      "title": "Apply leave-in conditioner.",
      "content": "Apply leave-in conditioner. Leave-in conditioners make hair smoother, stronger and more flexible. Begin by working a small amount, about 1 tsp, into your hair. Too much conditioner can leave your hair weighed-down. Apply conditioner to sections of your hair to ensure it is evenly distributed. Avoid applying it to your roots. Apply leave-in conditioner to your ends and about halfway up to your roots. Don’t use leave-in conditioner and regular conditioner if your hair is fine. You can add more conditioner as needed."

      "content": "Consider a curl-enhancing product. If you have very straight hair that struggles to hold a curl, adding a texturing spray, sea salt spray, light hold gel, or a small amount of mousse may help your hair hold a curl for longer. A curl-enhancing cream can also be helpful if your hair has a slight wave to it already.

As long as you choose the best product for your hair type, your hair should not look greasy."

      "title": "Cut cloth strips.",
      "content": "Cut cloth strips. To make rag curls you will need small pieces of fabric, about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) long and about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. How many you need will depend on how tight of a wave you want. Begin with 12 strips, 6 for the top layer of your hair, 6 for the bottom. Cutting up an old pillowcase or old shirt can be an economical way to get fabric."

    {
      "title": "Separate a section of your hair.",
      "content": "Separate a section of your hair. You will have 6 rag curls that go around the crown of your head, then another 6 that go a little below. This means you’ll have 2 sections of hair on each side and 2 sections at the back in your first layer of curls. Pull a small handful of hair away from your face. If you divide the side of your head into quarters, it will be 1 quarter of that hair."

      "title": "Roll 1 section of hair.",
      "content": "Roll 1 section of hair. Spray the ends of your hair with water to make it easier to keep them together. Then, place the rag at the tip of your hair and begin rolling under. At first it will be tricky and the tip will want to come out. Keep tucking it back in and roll your hair upward. Watching what you’re doing in the mirror will help as you’re first learning."

      "title": "Tie the rag curl.",
      "content": "Tie the rag curl. Take the 2 ends of fabric and tie them together to secure the curl. You will want the knot to be snug enough that it will not come out as you sleep, but not so tight that you cannot untie it the next day."

      "content": "Set the curl. Allow the hair to dry overnight by sleeping with the damp rag curls. In the morning, undo the knots to release loose waves. Run your fingers through your hair to turn ringlets into waves. Do not use a comb or brush as this creates frizz. Apply hairspray to set the waves if you have hair that easily loses body."

      "title": "Try using foam curlers.",
      "content": "Try using foam curlers. If you struggle with using rags to curl your hair, purchase foam curlers instead. The process is exactly the same, only instead of tying a rag to set the curl you will instead clip a plastic cross-bar or special pin. [5] X Research source Some people find sleeping on curlers to be uncomfortable or difficult. Remember that the size of the curler will determine how loose or tight the waves are. Big curlers make loose waves."

      "content": "Divide your hair into sections. The hair should still be damp as you do this. The size of the braid will determine how wavy your hair will be. The bigger the braid, the less wavy your hair will appear. If you want a tight crimp from the braids, divide your hair into many small sections to braid. If you want loose waves, divide your hair into four or five sections."

Hold the left section in your left hand, the right section in your right hand, and the middle section between 2 fingers of your dominant hand. Cross the hair over the middle strand. [6] X Research source First bring the right strand over the middle strand. What was the right strand is now the middle strand. Now bring the left strand over the middle. What was the left strand is now the middle. Repeat this process until the whole section has formed a braid. Make sure that you braid your hair using strong, even tension to get the best results."

      "content": "Secure the braid. At the end of the braid, use a wide elastic band or butterfly clip to keep the braid in place. You want the braid to be secure enough that sleeping on it or blow-drying it will not cause it to come loose.

Begin as near the crown of your head as possible, to ensure that the waves don’t begin halfway down your head. Braid as far down the section as you can so that the tips of your hair are not straight when you undo the braid."

      "content": "Apply hairspray. If your hair tends to lose curl easily, add a light covering of hair spray to fix the curls. Choose one with a relaxed hold so that the hair does not become crunchy or sticky. For more volume, try using a texturizing spray instead."

      "title": "Divide damp hair into sections.",
      "content": "Divide damp hair into sections. The more sections you create, the more waves you will have. It is a good idea to have a top layer of sections around the crown of your head and a second layer around the bottom. If you plan to have your hair parted after your waves are done, make sure to have that part in place before dividing your hair into sections. Start with 10 to 12 even sections and secure each of the sections using a clip. After you have experimented you may find you like more or fewer sections depending on hair length or texture."

Work your way backward. Start with a section near the crown of your head. If you start with a lower section, hair from an upper section is likely to get in your way."

      "title": "Affix the bun in place.",
      "content": "Affix the bun in place. How large the buns are will depend on how long your hair is and may determine what you use to secure it. Larger buns may require an elastic band around the circumference of the bun. Use bobby pins to hold smaller buns in place. Use 2 at perpendicular angles to ensure an even hold."

    {
      "title": "Set the curl.",
      "content": "Set the curl. The curls will need to dry completely before you undo the buns. Sleeping on your wet hair is often the best way to do this. Light blowdrying using a diffuser may also help, but the heat is unlikely to penetrate to the center of the bun."

    {
      "title": "Release the buns.",
      "content": "Release the buns. When the hair has dried completely, undo each bun carefully. First, apply a small amount of shine serum or styling cream to the palms of your hands. Then, run your fingers gently through your hair to make loose waves, but do not brush or comb it. Use a hair spray or scrunch fixative gel into your hair to ensure that the waves will stay all day."
