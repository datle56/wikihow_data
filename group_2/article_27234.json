      "content": "Trace your feet on a piece of construction paper. When tracing your feet, it's not necessary to go in between your toes. Just trace the outline of what your feet look like. The two feet will be glued together to form the turkey's body. Trace both your left and right foot. You can create the turkey body out of any color you want, but brown is the most commonly used and will resemble the look of a turkey the most."

      "content": "Trace your hands on six to seven pieces of colorful construction paper. Use whatever colors you like the best, and use a pencil or pen to trace around your fingers. Repeat this process on different colored paper to create all of the feathers for your turkey. You can use one or both hands for this step. Trace in between your fingers and around your thumb."

      "title": "Glue both feet together to form the body.",
      "content": "Glue both feet together to form the body. Line up both of your cutouts so that your heels overlap each other, but so that the toes of your cutout go out at a 30-degree angle. This should make it look like a single cutout with one neck and head, and two bumps that represent the turkey's stomach. You can use liquid glue or a glue stick."

      "title": "Glue the paper hands onto the back of the body of the turkey.",
      "content": "Glue the paper hands onto the back of the body of the turkey. Arrange the hands behind the turkey to get a feeling for what it will look like once it's done. Stack your traced out hands on an angle and glue them together so that the feathers look like they are spread out. Once your hands are glued together, take them and glue them to the back of your turkey's body. [1] X Research source Center the hands on the back of your turkey's body, so that they come rising from behind your turkey's head or the heel of your cutout."

      "content": "Paste the beak and wattle below your turkey's eyes. Glue the rest of your pieces onto the turkey's face. If you've run out of construction paper for the turkey's features, you can draw them on with a pencil or pen. The beak should be pasted under the eyes, and the wattle should go right under the beak. Once the glue dries, your project is finished."

Feel free to get creative and layer your handprints however you want if you don't like the way it looks. Use one hand when fingerpainting so your other hand is clean and free to touch other things."

Once you're done coloring the turkey, you're done with the project. [8] X Research source You can glue candy corn to your fingers to give your feathers a more colorful look.
