      "content": "Make a molasses trap in a glass jar. Take a clean glass jar and place a generous spoonful of molasses inside it. Add a bit of water to make the molasses just a bit more runny, then place the open jar in the area where you have heard or seen the crickets. The crickets will be attracted to the molasses and jump into the jar to get to it. Then, once they’re inside, the sticky molasses will make it hard for them to escape. [1] X Research source Once you’ve got your crickets trapped, you can either kill them, set them free outside, or, if you like to fish, you can use them as fish bait. This is a good option if you only have one or two crickets hopping around, but if you have a more intense infestation on your hands, you may want to try out commercial sticky traps (which we’ll go over below)."

      "content": "Use a beer can to catch the cricket. Take a can of beer and empty the contents, leaving behind just a few drops. Leave the beer can lying on its side in the area where the crickets are. The crickets will be attracted to the beer and crawl in the can to get to the drops left inside,then they’ll have a hard time getting out. [2] X Research source Since you can’t see through the can to tell when a cricket’s gotten inside, you may want to sit somewhere near the can and keep an eye on it, or check it on a regular basis. Like the first option, this method works best if you only have a few crickets loose in your house, since a bunch of crickets likely won’t fit in one can."

      "content": "Buy commercial sticky traps and place them in your house. For an effective, fool-proof option, Ramsay recommends purchasing a few commercial sticky traps (also called glue traps) and placing them around your home wherever you believe there might be crickets. [3] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. The crickets will walk over the sticky traps and get stuck. [4] X Research source Placing a bit of cornmeal in the center of each trap will help attract the crickets to the traps, as well. This method works well if you’re dealing with more than 1 or 2 crickets, since you can place several traps all around your house."

      "title": "Buy light traps and place them throughout your house.",
      "content": "Buy light traps and place them throughout your house. Crickets are attracted to light, so light traps can also help lure them out of their hiding spots. There are several commercial light traps out there that you can purchase, and they’ll attract other flying insects, as well, so they’re a good product to try out if you tend to get a lot of bugs in your home."

      "content": "Smash the cricket. This is the most straightforward way to kill a cricket. If you see a cricket that has snuck into your home, and you don’t want to catch it, then simply use something like a shoe or a broom and smash the cricket. Try to be as humane as possible when killing the cricket. Give it a few hard smacks so that you can be sure the cricket is dead."

      "title": "Use an insect spray.",
      "content": "Use an insect spray. There are many commercial insecticides readily available. If you have a problem with insects in your home in general, purchasing this type of product is a good idea because you can use it to kill crickets and any other type of bug that finds its way in. Follow the instructions listed on the specific product you buy, but in general, you'll simply need to spray the cricket with the insecticide to kill it. After you’ve killed the cricket, dispose of it by using a large wad of toilet paper. Flush the dead cricket down the toilet or throw it in a closed trash can. Clean the area where you’ve sprayed the bug spray with a disinfectant, and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water."

      "content": "Spray the cricket with pepper spray. If you have some pepper spray on hand, you can quickly kill the cricket by spraying it onto the insect, since pepper spray is deadly to them. Be careful when using pepper spray—it will be painful for you if you get it near your face. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards."

      "title": "Vacuum the cricket up.",
      "content": "Vacuum the cricket up. If you’ve already trapped the cricket but you don’t feel comfortable smashing it or spraying it, try sucking the cricket up with the nozzle of your vacuum. [5] X Research source If you have a bagless vacuum cleaner, be sure to empty the contents of the container in a trash can outside your home. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a bag, replace the bag immediately after you finish. Throw away the used bag in a trash can outdoors and away from your home."

      "content": "Get a cat or a dog. Cats and dogs are great for taking care of any unwanted insects that might sneak into your home. [6] X Research source They are much better at finding insects than humans, so if you tend to get crickets in your home, consider getting a pet and letting them do the hard work. Keep in mind that keeping a pet is a big commitment. Don’t get a cat or dog for the sole purpose of killing crickets–make sure you actually want to provide them a loving home!"

      "title": "Seal up any potential entry points the crickets may be using.",
      "content": "Seal up any potential entry points the crickets may be using. “One of the clearest reasons why people have homes full of crickets is that they have pest entry points on the outside of their home that allow these organisms to easily get inside,” says Ramsey. [7] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. “So, a really important way to exclude them would be to seal these cracks and crevices using caulk, copper wool, or steel wool. If you seal those cracks and crevices, you can stop them from being able to get inside easily,” he explains. [8] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Additionally, make sure to repair any broken window screens and make sure there are no gaps around windows or doors, since crickets can enter through these openings."

      "content": "Get rid of cardboard boxes. Ramsay explains that crickets love to chew on cardboard boxes. “They can feed on the paper fibers that the cardboard is made out of, and it’s a good source of sugar and food for them. But in addition to that, when cardboard is allowed to sit for long periods of time, especially if it gets a bit damp, small amounts of micro-fungi grow on it, and the crickets are attracted to it and consume it,” he says [9] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. So, if you have a storage room or basement in your home that you’ve filled up with cardboard boxes, Ramsay recommends getting rid of them. [10] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Consider using plastic storage containers or a shelving unit to store your items, instead."

      "content": "Eliminate moisture and humidity in your home. “Crickets love humidity, so run a dehumidifier,” suggests Ramsay. “It will dry out the air, and it will make it a lot more difficult for them to find a suitable habitat if they happen to make it inside,” he says. [11] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Dehumidifiers are also helpful for preventing mold if you live in a particularly damp or humid area."

      "content": "Reduce outdoor lighting at night. Crickets are attracted to bright lights, so reducing the amount of outdoor lighting can be helpful to make them less attracted to your home. Try replacing any outdoor lights (e.g. porch lights) with warm yellow bulbs or sodium vapor bulbs , since these will be less appealing to crickets. [12] X Research source You can also use timers or motion sensors to make sure your outdoor lights turn off after a period of time, so they aren’t shining and attracting bugs all night."

      "content": "Fill your house with scents crickets don’t like. Crickets don’t like the smell of certain essential oils, like lavender , peppermint , and citronella . They also dislike the scent of vinegar. [13] X Research source Because of this, doing things like diffusing essential oils, spraying lavender or peppermint scented room spray , lighting citronella candles , or using vinegar to clean may help prevent crickets."

      "content": "Apply diatomaceous earth around your baseboards. Diatomaceous earth is made from fossilized aquatic organisms, and it’s often used to kill insects. When the insect comes into contact with the substance, it absorbs the oils and fats from the cuticle of the insect’s exoskeleton, essentially drying them out and killing them. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source To prevent crickets, apply diatomaceous earth around the baseboards of your house or any other potential entry points the crickets may be using to get in. When applying diatomaceous earth, follow the directions listed on the product you’ve purchased, and always use food-grade diatomaceous earth products . Take precautions to prevent inhaling the dust or exposing your skin to it, since it can cause irritation. Wear a dust mask, safety goggles, gloves, and clothing that covers up your arms and legs. Keep pets and children away from the areas where you’ve applied the diatomaceous earth. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Hire a pest control company. If you live in an area where insects are a common problem, you can probably find a pest control company that will come and spray your home with an insecticide a few times a year. If you are struggling with a cricket infestation, this may be the easiest way to deal with the problem. Make sure that any pest control company you hire is licensed in your state. If you have pets, be sure to let the company know, and ask them if their products are safe for humans, children, and pets. If you believe you might have a cricket trapped in your wall, that'll probably be too difficult to fix without a pro. In this case, it’s a good idea to give pest control a call, as well."

      "content": "Are crickets dangerous to humans? No, crickets are not dangerous to humans. They don’t pose any health risk, and they do not bite or sting. However, crickets can be a nuisance when they get into your home, since they make loud chirping noises at night that may keep you awake. Certain types of crickets can also cause damage to fabrics like cotton, silk, linen, and wool because they try to feed on them. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "How can you tell if there are crickets in your home? The most common sign of crickets in your home is the loud chirping sound that male crickets make by rubbing their front wings together. Crickets are nocturnal, so if you hear a lot of chirping inside your home during the evening and nighttime hours, you may have a cricket problem on your hands. Chewed edges on fabrics can be another side, but you may need to use a magnifying glass to see them. [19] X Research source"
