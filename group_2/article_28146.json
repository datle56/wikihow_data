      "content": "Strain 2 cups (400 g) of sushi rice under running water. According to chef Daniel Siriban, \"it's very important that you have the correct rice.\" He recommends Japanese short grain rice, \"because if you're moving into larger grades of rice that's medium or long, it requires a little bit more moisture [to cook].\" In addition, short grain rice is \"finer and [has] more finesse to it,\" making for more delicate sushi. Take a large amount of rice and place it in a mesh strainer. Hold the dry rice beneath cool running water, rotating the strainer so all of the rice gets soaked. Keep an eye on the water dripping beneath the strainer—once the water looks clear and not clouded, you can turn off the faucet and remove the wet rice from the sink area. [1] X Research source Cleaning your rice is an important process in the sushi-making process, as it helps improve the quality of the rice. It might take a minute or so before the water looks clear, depending on how much rice you’re using."

      "title": "Add water and rice to a saucepan.",
      "content": "Add water and rice to a saucepan. The exact water to rice ratio that you use will depend on the type of rice you are using. For Japanese short grain rice, chef Daniel Siriban emphasizes that the water to rice ratio \"should always be one to one\". For longer grain rices, you can try a in a 3:2 ratio. Pour your damp rice into an empty saucepan. Next, dump in about 1.5 cups (350 mL) of cold water. Make sure that there’s more water than rice in the saucepan, as sushi rice is extremely absorbent. [3] X Research source If you don’t add enough water to your rice, it’ll be dry instead of fluffy."

      "title": "Cook the rice for 10 minutes after the water boils.",
      "content": "Cook the rice for 10 minutes after the water boils. Wait for the water in the pot to reach a boil, then set a timer for 10 minutes so the rice can fully cook. Cover the saucepan with a lid so the rice can absorb as much water as possible. [4] X Research source Don’t lift the lid and stir the rice, as this can make the grains mushy and congealed. [5] X Research source If you added too much water to the rice, it might not be able to soak up the water."

      "content": "Mix a small amount of salt, sugar, and rice vinegar together. In a separate bowl, mix 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of rice vinegar, ¼ cup (25 g) of white sugar, and 1 tsp (5.7 g) of salt together. Stir the ingredients with a spoon and wait for the salt and sugar to dissolve completely. Once you’ve made your vinegar solution, set it aside for later. [6] X Research source This mixture helps add flavor to the sushi rice, and prevents it from tasting bland. You can also make the vinegar mixture over medium heat on the stovetop by mixing the sugar, salt, and vinegar with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Arrange the rice onto a cooking tray or bowl so it can cool. Use a spoon to scoop the rice onto a flat tray or into a large bowl. Try not to touch any of the rice as you transfer it, as the grains will be extremely hot. [8] X Research source Cover the rice with a damp towel to help the cooling process. You can also fan the rice to help it cool more quickly. [9] X Research source Don’t leave cooked rice out for more than 2 hours, as it can spoil after that time. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix the vinegar solution into the cooling rice to give it flavor. After the rice is cool enough to touch, drizzle your vinegar, sugar, and salt solution over the grains. Use a wooden spoon as well as your own fingertips to mix this vinegar into the sushi rice. [11] X Research source Always wash your hands before handling any type of food. Try to keep the grains of rice fairly separated, instead of clumped together. This helps the rice to feel and taste fluffier."

      "content": "Select raw tuna or salmon for an authentic sushi roll. If you’re using fresh or raw fish for your sushi roll, leave it in the freezer for at least 24 hours to get rid of any possible parasites. While it’s tempting to use fish that you just purchased from the store, you don’t want to risk spreading any food-borne illnesses. If you’d prefer not to worry about food parasites, try using cooked meat instead. [12] X Research source Salmon and tuna are some of the most common raw fish used to make sushi."

      "title": "Go for cooked eel or crab if you don’t like raw fish.",
      "content": "Go for cooked eel or crab if you don’t like raw fish. Look in your local grocery store or market for cans of cooked seafood, like eel or crab. If you’d prefer to enjoy sushi without any risk of food-borne illnesses, opt for fillings that don’t need to be cooked or prepared ahead of time. [13] X Research source Cooked shrimp are another great alternative for people who don’t like raw fish."

      "content": "Rub oily fish with sea salt and vinegar to enhance their flavor. Before cutting your fish fillets into smaller pieces, rub them down with a few pinches of sea salt. Let the salt soak into the fish for about 30 minutes, then drizzle a tiny amount of rice vinegar over both sides of the fillets. [14] X Research source This works best with large fish fillets, like tuna, salmon, or mackerel. If you’re working with shrimp, crab, or another shellfish, you don’t need to worry about this."

      "content": "Use vegetables like cucumbers and carrots to add texture to your roll. Look for other fillings besides fish and seafood to fill your roll. Instead, include some additional nutrition in your sushi by adding cucumber, carrot, and other fresh vegetables. While you need to peel the carrots before slicing them into small ribbons, you don’t need to peel your cucumbers. [15] X Research source Vegetables add a delicious crunch to your sushi roll."

      "content": "Choose crab and tuna without bits of shell or sinew. Always inspect your fillings before you slice them up. Examine your tuna fillets for excess sinew, as this can make your fish a lot more difficult to chew. Additionally, check your fresh crab for any pieces of shell. Trim and remove any of these undesired elements, as they can make your sushi more difficult to enjoy. [16] X Research source Use canned crab to avoid running into any shell pieces. Additionally, canned tuna won’t have any sinew."

According to chef Daniel Siriban, \"cut long strokes\" - think about breaking your salmon into \"small quarters of filets.\" Ideally, you'll use a sashimi knife because \"clean cuts are very important.\" Since you’ll be constructing your sushi roll lengthwise, aim to make your fish pieces long and narrow. Ideally, try to keep these pieces around 0.25 in (0.64 cm) wide and 4 in (10 cm), so they can fit nicely in the center of your sushi roll. [17] X Research source Since you might be adding other ingredients into your sushi roll, try to keep your fillings as manageable as possible."

Place your carrots, cucumbers, and any other vegetable of choice onto a cutting board and begin slicing them into thin, narrow strips. Ideally, try to make your vegetables less than 0.25 in (0.64 cm) wide and 4 in (10 cm). [18] X Research source You’re welcome to slice your vegetables more thinly, especially if you’re trying to fit a lot ingredients into your sushi roll. Aim for your vegetable slices to look like a julienne. It’s okay if you leave the skin on your cucumber."

After scooping the produce out of the hard skin, begin cutting the ingredient into halves. Next, slice each half of the avocado into 0.25 in (0.64 cm). [19] X Research source Since ripe avocados are soft, they are pretty malleable when used in a sushi roll. If needed, you can always trim your avocado into smaller slices."

If you want to keep your bamboo mat clean, chef Daniel Siriban recommends a piece of \"plastic wrap under the maki so that you're not touching the sushi rice with the roller.\" Next, take a flat sheet of nori, or dried seaweed, and arrange it 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the edge of the mat. It doesn’t matter if the nori is centered perfectly—all that matters is that it’s completely flat. [20] X Research source Nori sheets come in packs, which works well when you’re preparing a lot of sushi at once."

Moisten your fingertips with cool water so the rice doesn’t stick to your fingers, then scoop a small amount out of the bowl or cooking sheet. Start arranging the rice along the surface of the nori, leaving 0.25 in (0.64 cm) of space along the outer edge of the sheet. Continue adding rice until the most of the seaweed is covered in a thin layer of rice. [21] X Research source The amount of rice you add is completely up to you. If you’re thinking about adding a lot of fillings, only use ½ cup (100 g) or so of rice."

If you’re feeling especially creative, try using specific ingredient combinations to make special, well-known sushi rolls. Try aligning your strips of meat and vegetable as though you’re drawing a line down the middle of the rice, so the sushi will be easier to roll up. [22] X Research source To add some kick to your roll, try including ¼ tsp (1.25 g) of wasabi as a filling in your roll."

Use both hands to push the edge of the mat forward, rolling it up in the same way that you’d roll a piece of cloth or paper. Continue rolling the bamboo along the outside of the nori, rice, and fillings, tucking the ingredients into a rounded shape. Once you reach the section of nori without any rice, stop rolling the bamboo. [23] X Research source This process helps you form the sushi roll without losing any of the toppings or other ingredients in the process."

Use your fingers to pinch around the sides and surface of the bamboo mat, forming the sushi roll into your desired shape. As you pinch and squeeze your food, note that the sushi roll itself will resemble a slight square shape. Keep pinching until you’re satisfied with the way that your sushi looks. [24] X Research source If any fillings are squeezing out of the sushi, this is a good time to force them back into place. Don’t apply too much force—you’re only trying to shape the sushi."

Use both hands to lift and move your roll to a cutting board. If the sushi looks like it’s about to unravel, try squeezing it within the bamboo mat for a little longer. [25] X Research source Don’t be discouraged if your sushi doesn’t look great on your first try. It takes a lot of time and practice to master the art of sushi rolling!"

Chef Daniel Siriban recommends: \"make sure that your knife has a bit of moisture; it's good to dip the edge of the knife in a bath of water.\" Do this before you begin cutting as well as between each slice to prevent the rice from sticking to the knife. Once you have 2 equal halves, continue cutting chopping each half into 3 even pieces. Arrange these pieces of sushi vertically or horizontally on your plate, depending on how you’d like to present them! [26] X Research source"
