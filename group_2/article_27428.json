[4] X Expert Source Lorena Barcal Clinical Herbalist & Clean Beauty Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2020. Most people prefer brown sugar, which can be a little softer than white granulated sugar. If you have sensitive or sore lips, use superfine (caster) sugar instead, which has extra-small, gentle grains. Your lips themselves carry very little dead skin. [5] X Research source A little exfoliation might help, especially if the skin around your lips is flaky, but moisturizing is often more important. This scrub does both. If all of your sugar dissolves, just add in more until the mixture is a little gritty."

      "content": "Rub the mixture onto your lips. Dip a clean finger or cotton swab into the scrub, making sure you pick up some sugar grains. Gently rub this over your lips for about 10 seconds. [6] X Research source Some of the sugar might dissolve, while other grains will sit on top of your lips."

      "content": "Rinse off with warm water. We won't tell anyone if you decide to lick it off instead. Once it's gone, check out your lips in the mirror. Hopefully, they look fresher and feel smoother. If you're looking to keep your lips moisturized long-term, apply homemade lip balm after rinsing."

If the honey crystallizes, just place the container in a shallow bowl of hot tap water until the honey melts. Honey is a natural preservative, making this safer than most homemade scrubs.

If you're not satisfied with the scrub, try these changes: If your lips are extra-dry, add another 2 tsp (10mL) oil. [11] X Research source If your lips are sore or rubbed raw, mix in more honey until the scrub feels soft against your lips. If your lips still feel flaky after scrubbing, try a lip balm first. You can try to add more sugar to the scrub instead, but this can backfire by making your lips raw and damaged."

      "title": "Switch to a heavier oil for extra moisture.",

If these feel too greasy to you, try jojoba oil or another light, extra-moisturizing oil. Petroleum jelly is not a great choice for a lip scrub since the lips won't absorb it. [13] X Research source It's better in a lip balm, where it sits on top of your lips and stops moisture from evaporating."
