Some of the following are different styles of memes: [2] X Research source Traditional: memes are the typical memes you see circulating on social media. They usually contain highly recognizable images, such as a scene from a movie, a celebrity, images of cats, or a viral image. They often comment on the latest trends and current events. Dank: memes involve absurd or out-of-context humor. Dank memes often try to parody traditional memes by applying them in absurd new ways. They often target memes that are going out of style or dying.

      "title": "Understand meme humor.",
      "content": "Understand meme humor. Most often, memes make fun of the way people react to a popular trend or current event. The humor is usually based in sarcasm. Sometimes meme humor can be absurd or patently nonsensical. The entertainment comes from pointing out the ridiculousness of a situation, or just being ridiculous. [4] X Research source One example of meme humor is the influx of memes regarding Harambe the gorilla after he was killed by Cincinnati Zoo staff in order to save a child who fell into the enclosure. These memes used sarcasm to mock the way animal lovers reacted to the death of the endangered gorilla. An example of absurd meme humor is the practice of using bass drops or distorted sound to emphasize a moment in a video so much that it's the only reason why you watched it."

      "title": "Research memes that are current.",
      "content": "Research memes that are current. Many meme styles come and go over the years. You don't want to make memes that are outdated. Search for memes from the current year to see what is popular. Also, pay attention to the memes that other people are posting wherever you hang out on the internet. Whether it's Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, or 4Chan. You should try to avoid using \"dead\" memes. A meme is said to be \"dead\" when people stop using the meme as a base image, or forget all about it. Try to find current memes from subreddits like r/memes and r/dankmemes. Moreover, sometimes a certain type of meme gets famous. In that case, you should try to make those memes. For example, recently Bernie Sanders was trending for a few days. For example, typing memes October 2023 into Google turns up many memes about how this year keeps getting worse and worse, building up to megadisaster or apocalypse. knowyourmeme.com is a useful resource that catalogs different meme topics and provides detailed explanations of their origins and popular examples."

      "content": "Reference other memes or viral images and videos in your memes. When making memes, referencing popular events, books, movies, video games, and so on will increase the comedic value of the memes.

Popular images include Willy Wonka with a smug smile, Fry from Futurama squinting, and Joker dancing on the stairs."

      "content": "Combine two attributes that clash with one another. Pairing a tame image with explicit text (or vice versa) sets up the meme for a bizarre, nonsensical contrast. This type of absurdity is often the nature of viral memes. For example, combining an image of a kitten with profanity-laced humor is a good way to evoke an absurd tone."

      "title": "Find an image to use as your base.",
      "content": "Find an image to use as your base. Most memes are based on an image. Make sure it's an image or video that expresses the message you want to deliver. It can be a shot of an actor's reaction in a movie, it can be a screenshot of a ridiculous social media post, an image of a public figure. It may be two or more images you decide to display side-by-side. You can use Google Images to search for and download just about any image you can think of. You can also use the screen capture function on your computer, mobile phone, or tablet to capture images from videos, games, or social media."
