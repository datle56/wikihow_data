      "content": "Wake up earlier than normal on Christmas Eve morning. Doing this will make you more tired when you want to go to bed later that day. The night before Christmas Eve, stay awake as long as possible. Set your alarm for an early time like 6 am. When you wake up, you will be very tired and will want to go back to sleep, but resist the urge. When you have to go to sleep later that day, you will fall asleep easier because you are exhausted. If you use your phone as an alarm, change it to a sound you hate so you want to get out of bed. Put your alarm across the room so you must get out of bed to turn it off. When you get out of bed, you will be \"awake\" for the day. If you have a calendar in your bedroom, turn it back to a different month and pretend it's that month during the night. Make a playlist of songs you liked listening to at that time to capture the feeling even more."

      "content": "Track Santa. Tracking Santa's progress around the world is always a great way to get you excited for Christmas on Christmas Eve! Use websites such as NORAD Tracks Santa or Google Santa Tracker . Tracking Santa, in some cases, actually may do the opposite of what you want to happen. It may make you more excited so it's harder to sleep. The blue light from your electronic device may keep you awake as well."

      "title": "Think of it as a normal night.",
      "content": "Think of it as a normal night. Tell yourself that tonight is not Christmas Eve. Do the same things you always do in your bedtime routine: brush your teeth, read a book, chat with your friends, etc. Say to yourself: \"What am I gonna do tomorrow?\" -- like it's any normal day: \"Oh, hey, tomorrow maybe I will hang out with my 'bud', ______\"."

      "content": "Play a game with someone. A technique that, strange as it sounds, works well is to play a quiet game you can play alone (or with another hyper and excited friend or sibling), such as Mad Libs, while in bed. This will help take away your energy and help you fall fast asleep. [2] X Research source Santa came a lot quicker than you thought!"

      "title": "Exercise.",
      "content": "Exercise. Although this may seem counterintuitive, exercise can help to calm you down. A couple of hours before you go to bed., see how many push-ups, crunches, or jumping jacks you can do in your room. Exercise only for thirty minutes, though; you don't want to stay up too late. Exercising is a great way to help you feel physically tired so that your body will want to sleep. Better still, it will take your mind off Christmas for a little while."

      "content": "Drink warm milk. In addition to providing you with nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and L-tryptophan, warm milk can be a soothing, comforting drink that lulls you to sleep. You can also try hot herbal tea; it is soothing to drink. Just make sure it doesn’t contain caffeine! When you're setting up a cookie plate for Santa is a great time to have some warm milk. Or, drink hot chocolate after you are in your pajamas. This will also help you to relax and stay warm! Don't drink coffee. The caffeine in it can keep you awake. If warm milk disgusts you on its own, add some honey. It will make for a relaxing treat."

      "title": "Relax",
      "content": "Relax . If you are just jumping up and down and feeling hyperactive, you need to calm down; you're only feeding a buildup of excitement that it'll be hard to come down from. Read a book. Listen to music. Whatever makes you calm down and relax. [3] X Research source Read a book. It can be about Christmas, although it doesn't really matter. Try reading a school textbook, a really boring one from your least favorite class. Read a boring book to induce sleepiness; read an exciting one to get lost in and to help take away the urgency of thinking about Christmas things. Some good non-Christmas books are Harry Potter, Twilight, School of Fear, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. They are fairly long and can keep you occupied for a while. Burn a sweet-scented candle for a little while in a safe place in your room. The scent will help you to relax, particularly if you choose a scent like lavender or jasmine. Just make sure to extinguish it before you fall asleep! Mind dump your thoughts. If your mind is racing with tomorrow’s exciting events, grab a notepad and write down everything you are excited about and get it out of your system. Dump it all out of your mind and into your notepad. Repeat some relaxing mantras. Mantras have been classified as a form of meditation which involves continually repeating a specific word or phrase while passively tuning out any other type of internal or external distraction. The goal of using mantras is to repeat this word or phrase enough times to elicit a relaxation response."

You will become tired. This is important anytime you try to get to sleep, but relax and close your eyes. See some of the related wikiHow links in this article for more ideas on helping you to fall asleep, or visit the whole category on better sleeping . Fluff your pillow.

It helps you to sleep when you have someone else in the room with you. It will make you fall asleep a bit faster, although if it is a hamster or something of that size you may squish it."

Just make sure you don't take yourself too hot, or it will be just as hard to fall asleep as it is when you're cold. If it’s too hot, turn on the air conditioning, or open a window and sleep with just a sheet on you."

      "content": "Count sheep or even reindeer. Any of these methodical, centering and calming methods will help to move you out of being too excited into a calmer state, which may help you to feel sleepy. Try focusing on each of the sheep as they jump over the fence (or any other high platform). What do they look like? What type of fence are they jumping over? How high are they jumping? Focusing on these details will let your mind trail away from the idea of Christmas and will help you fall asleep."

Even keeping up the effort of concentration on doing this is a great distraction from the night's excitement. You may not even get up to your head before you're snoozing away!"

If you get up earlier than this, have some breakfast, go to the washroom, get ready so that you actually look OK on video. If you know you are going to be videotaped in the morning, prepare your best set of PJ's. You don't want everybody to remember you wearing that raggedy old t-shirt and a pair of shorts on Christmas morning, do you? Don't forget to brush your hair in the morning before galloping downstairs!"
