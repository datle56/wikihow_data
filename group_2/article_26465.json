Try to focus on how much you want to lose in 1 month and what you need to do to achieve that. Creating sub-goals to get you to your bigger goals will help to ensure that you stay on track. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, you might start by setting a 1 month weight loss goal of 8 pounds, which would require losing about 2 lb (0.91 kg) per week. This means that you’ll need to burn an extra 1,000 calories per day to achieve this goal, which you can do by cutting calories from your diet and exercising regularly."

However, if you can’t live without fruit, bread, pasta, and rice, then a low-fat diet may be a better choice. Remember, what’s most important is that you cut calories and create a deficit.
