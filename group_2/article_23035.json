      "content": "There are 4 mandatory and 13 optional rakat in the Isha prayer. Isha is one of the five daily prayers ( salat ) Muslims perform. Each prayer consists of certain repetitive cycles of prayers, bows, and prostrations known as rakat . The Isha prayer is performed after twilight but before midnight, and it consists of 4 mandatory rakat known as Fard and 13 optional rakat called Sunnah , Nafl , and Witr . The rakat are performed in the following order: [1] X Research source Sunnah Ghair mu’akkadah : 4 rakat Sunnah Ghair mu’akkadah are “non-confirmed” Sunnah that the Prophet Muhammad only sometimes performed. Fard : 4 rakat Sunnah mu’akkadah : 2 rakat Sunnah mu’akkadah are “confirmed” Sunnah prayers which the Prophet Muhammad always performed and never omitted. They’re still optional but more recommended than the Sunnah Ghair mu’akkadah Nafl : 2 rakat Nafl are completely optional prayers that are said to draw a person closer to Allah. Witr : 3 rakat While many Muslims view Witr as a voluntary prayer, some believe that it’s obligatory to perform alongside Fard . You have the option to perform 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 rakat of Witr . Nafl : 2 rakat The rakat for each type of prayer are performed with the same recitations and body movements. Some may have additional recitations depending on the prayer."

After reciting the Surat al-Fatiha , many recommend reciting the Surat al-A’la for during the first rak’ah , Surat al Kaafiroon for the second, and Surat al-Ikhlaas for the third. The last rak’ah often includes a supplication called Qunoot , which is an additional recitation you say before ruku (kneeling), or after ruku while standing. The supplication is: Allaahumma ihdinee feeman hadayta wa `aafinee feeman `aafayta wa tawallanee feeman tawallayta, wa baarik lee feemaa a`tayta, waqinee sharra maa qadayta, fa’innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa `alayka, innahu laa yadhillu man walayta, wa laa ya`izu man `adayta, tabaarakta rabbanaa wa ta`aalayta O Allah, guide me along with those whom You have guided, pardon me along with those whom You have pardoned, be an ally to me along with those whom You are an ally to and bless for me that which You have bestowed.
