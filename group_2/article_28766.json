      "content": "Fold a 3” wide ribbon into the shape of an awareness ribbon. Lay the length of ribbon flat on your workspace and mark the midpoint by measuring it and using a fabric marker or by folding the ribbon in half and lightly creasing along the fold. Fold the left end of the ribbon to the right in a shallow diagonal. Then fold the right side diagonally so it crosses the first end."

Use your thumb and forefinger to bunch all three layers of ribbon together. When bunching the ribbon to create the bow, you can make it look neater by creating 3-4 small folds. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Loop a hair tie around a zip tie and secure the bow with the zip tie. While holding the bunched section, wrap a 4” cable tie around it. Slip a hair tie through the zip tie, and pull the zip tie just tight enough to secure the bow. [2] X Research source Adjust the bow so it’s even, and move the elastic hairband to the back near when the zip tie fastens. [3] X Research source Pull the zip tie tight, and then use your scissors to cut the zip tie’s excess tail flush with its fastener. Alternatively, secure the bow with the zip tie, then hot glue a hair tie to the zip tie on the back of the bow. Press one side of the elastic hairband into the glue and hold until set. [4] X Research source Be careful to allow the glue to cool slightly before attaching the elastic hairband. Hot glue can burn your skin if you touch it before it cools. Remove any excess hot glue by lightly scratching it off or loosening it with rubbing alcohol."

      "content": "Hide the cable tie with a piece of narrow grosgrain ribbon . Place a dab of hot glue on the center of the back of the bow. Press the end of your narrower ribbon into the glue and allow it to set. Then, wrap the ribbon around the center of the bow and press into the glue on the back. [5] X Research source Alternatively, attach the narrow ribbon around the bow with ¼” double-sided tape . Remove the backing strip from one side of the tape and stick it to the back of the ribbon. Trim if necessary, and then remove the backing strip from the other side of the tape. Wrap the ribbon with the double-sided tape down around the cable tie securing the middle of the bow. Trim off any ribbon that extends beyond the center of the bow. To make the bow look like it was tied, cut a 3” to 4” length of your narrower ribbon. This works best with ½” to ⅞” widths. Tie a knot and pull tight. Trim the excess ribbon so there are about two inches on each side of the knot. Glue the knot to the front of your cheer bow, then wrap the ends around to the back and glue them together covering the glued section of the elastic hairband. Trim any excess ribbon."

      "content": "Trim and seal the bow’s tails to prevent fraying. Use your scissors to cut the end of each of the bow’s tails on a diagonal or in a chevron (or fishtail) shape. You can cut an even chevron shape by folding the very end of the tail in half lengthwise and then cutting from the fold to the edge in a downward diagonal. After cutting, use your lighter to skim the flame quickly along the cut edge of the ribbon to seal it. [6] X Research source Make sure you move very quickly and only touch the flame to the very edge of the ribbon, or it could melt."
