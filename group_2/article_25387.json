[4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You might feel like your knee is about to burst, particularly when you are standing up with your legs straight--this is when the skin around your knee is fully stretched and you’ll be able to notice the feeling of tightness.

[6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tightness, on the other hand, will feel like your knee is a water balloon that is about to pop. Your knee might feel stiff because the cyst will cause the joint and muscles in your knee to become inflamed, making them stiff. [7] X Research source Aktolun, C., &amp; Goldsmith, S. J. (2013).

      "title": "Pay attention to any pain you feel at the back of your knee.",
      "content": "Pay attention to any pain you feel at the back of your knee. When the cyst behind your knee fills with fluid, it will put pressure on your knee. It may also put pressure on the nerves in the area behind your knee; when nerves are pressed on, you might feel pain. If the cyst is pressing nerves you will definitely feel pain when you move your knee a lot. [8] X Research source Most people with baker’s cysts describe the pain in two ways: Some people feel localized pain, which means they feel intense pain right where the swelling is worst. Some people feel general pain through the knee."

      "content": "Monitor an increase in pain anytime you move your knee. While early stage baker’s cysts might cause pain when you use your knee a lot or when you move in a certain way, as the cyst gets worse you will be able to feel the pain whenever you move, regardless of how small the movement its. [9] X Research source Aktolun, C., &amp; Goldsmith, S. J. (2013). Nuclear medicine therapy: Principles and clinical applications. New York, NY: Springer. The pain will become more intense and may take on a burning sensation right where the cyst is located."

      "content": "Watch for any visible fluid at the back of your knee. When too much pressure gets put on the cyst at the knee joint, the cyst can actually tear. The fluid from the cyst will drain into the surrounding area, and the cyst will actually split open so that you might be able to see liquid leaking down the back side of your knee.

      "content": "Monitor how much you can move your knee. The longer you wait to take care of the cyst, the less you will be able to move your knee. This inability to move well is both because of the pain you will feel when you move, and the inflammation that will actually keep you from bending your knee.

      "content": "Look out for signs of enlargement. Sometimes a baker's cyst might become enlarged and actually spread down into your calf muscle. If this happens, your calf might develop a red, rash-like appearance. Your leg might also feel warm (which is known as erythema) and your lower leg could become swollen (which is called distal edema). The swelling is caused by the enlarged cyst pressing on the veins of your leg. [13] X Research source If you are aware of other medical conditions, this enlarged cyst is similar to the condition called deep vein thrombosis."

      "content": "Be aware that an enlarged cyst can rupture. On rare occasions, an enlarged cyst can break open, leaking fluid into your calf muscle. Signs that this has happened include severe pain, warmth, and tenderness in your calf. Your calf might also develop red or blueish spots where blood has leaked into the surrounding tissue. If you see any of these symptoms, go to a hospital immediately. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand that some health conditions can lead to the creation of baker’s cysts. Baker’s cyst is common in people who have an underlying condition that is affecting their knees. When your knee is dealing with other causes of inflammation and pain, it becomes more likely that a cyst will develop because of that inflammation. Conditions that make it more likely that you will get a baker’s cyst include: [15] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout and psoriatic arthritis."

If you have injured parts of your knee in the past, such as sustaining a meniscus tear or straining one of your ligaments, your chances of getting a cyst increase.

      "content": "Be aware that previous surgeries can predispose you to getting these cysts. If you did have a knee injury in the past, chances are that you had surgery to correct the injury. When your knee gets worked on, it can potentially become inflamed later if you stress it too much before it is fully healed. Like with arthritis, the inflammation caused by this stress can make you more prone to getting cysts.
