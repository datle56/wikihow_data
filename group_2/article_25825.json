  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Use neat paper.",
      "content": "Use neat paper. Lined notebook paper will work best since you will not have sloped sentences and the layout will be neat. Make sure it is not wrinkled or damaged."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a writing utensil.",
      "content": "Pick a writing utensil. A fairly new, standard pen or pencil is a good idea as it won't run out quickly. You can also use markers. Choose a color that will show clearly on the paper; pale colors on white paper won't show up very well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be aware of how you write.",
      "content": "Be aware of how you write. If you write small, then practice writing bigger. If your letters take up two lines, shrink them a bit. They should fit comfortably on a lined sheet of paper, not overlapping or crowding the page."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your note/letter short, sweet, and to the point.",
      "content": "Keep your note/letter short, sweet, and to the point. You can go two ways: with a poem , or an actual note. For poems: Don't write too mushy. The last thing you want is for the person to be disgusted while reading about how you have a shrine to them. Comment on how pretty they are. The main things people love to be complimented on are, eyes, smile, and personality (how funny, nice, sweet, or kind they are). If you choose just a standard note form, write it like a normal letter. Write about how you've noticed how beautiful they are, and how you think about them. Mostly when like \"all the time\" or if you want to be more creative, go with something like \"every moment of the day\"."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a \"tracer\".",
      "content": "Use a \"tracer\". A \"tracer\" is a certain key phrase that is unique to your secret admirer notes. It should be a short phrase that is very easy to remember. You may use this as a P.S. side note or as your last sentence in each note. Just be sure you have consistency so your crush will know the notes are from the same person every time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sign off.",
      "content": "Sign off. Write \"Your Secret Admirer\" in a much neater, more elegant script than the rest of the note. After the first note is received, you may choose to sign it as S.A., but to spell it out is more formal and mature."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send it.",
      "content": "Send it. There are a number of ways to do this: The easiest way to deliver the note, especially if you are in school, is to slide it in a locker vent. They will get it the moment they open their locker and be surprised. Slip it in their books/backpack. Be careful with this one. Your cover will be instantly blown with one glance. Hide it in their bedroom. This is only applicable if you know them well and have access to their house. Only do this if you are visiting with more than one person. If you were the only visitor at their house, your cover will be blown."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen.",
      "content": "Listen. If they talk about the note, they got it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the next ones.",
      "content": "Prepare the next ones. Your follow-up notes should be different, but just as sweet. Comment on recent changes to show you care, but make sure you use your \"tracer\". Your notes should be anywhere from a week to two and a half weeks apart. You want them to anticipate the notes, but not forget all about them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Meet.",
      "content": "Meet. After you have written at least ten or fifteen notes, use your \"tracer\" as a way to reveal yourself. Maybe say it during a small conversation with them or in another conversation but loud enough they can hear. Use the surprise and shock in their eyes to let them strike up the million-dollar question: Are YOU my Secret Admirer?"
