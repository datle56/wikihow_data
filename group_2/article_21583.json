If you don't do a deauth attack, you might have to wait around for a long time for a handshake to complete—you'll need that handshake to crack the password.

[6] X Research source This command will send 2 deauth packets to disconnect the client from the network. [7] X Research source Don't try to send more than this—sending too many packets could prevent the client from reconnecting and generating the handshake. As long as you're close enough to the target client, they'll be disconnected from the router and forced to reconnect with a handshake. If this doesn't work, move closer to the client. As soon as the client reconnects, all of the information you'll need to crack the password will be available."
