Stir them together with a spoon until they are fully combined. [1] X Research source Liquid glue is also known as school glue. Any colour glue will work for this recipe. If you want a darker shade, add another 5 drops of food colouring into the bowl. If you don't have your desired colour, try mixing colours together. For example, blue and yellow create green, blue and red make purple, and red and yellow create orange."

This helps to thicken the slime. [2] X Research source If there are any lumps of baking soda in the mixture, simply squish them with the back of your spoon."

      "content": "Mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of eye drops into the slime mixture. Check the ingredients on the back of the eye drops to ensure that they contain boric acid, as this is the ingredient that causes the mixture to go stretchy. Measure the eye drops into the bowl of glue and baking soda and then stir the ingredients until they are fully combined. [3] X Research source If you don't have any eye drops, use contact solution instead. [4] X Research source 2 tablespoons (30 mL) is equivalent to about 50 drops."

      "content": "Wet your hands with eye drops. Squeeze a little eye drop solution onto your hands and then rub them together. This stops the slime from sticking to your hands when you knead it. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the slime with your hands for 5 minutes. Pick the slime out of the bowl and hold it in your hands. Stretch the slime as far as you can and then squish it back into a ball. Continue to repeat this process for about 5 minutes to make your slime nice and stretchy. [6] X Research source If the slime isn't stretchy enough after 5 minutes, continue to knead it until you are happy with the consistency."

      "content": "Place the slime in an airtight container to keep it fresh. This helps to prolong the life of your slime and stops it from quickly going hard. Make sure that the lid is properly on your container to stop any air from getting in. [7] X Research source If you don't have an airtight container, use an airtight plastic bag instead. Expect your slime to last about 1 week."

Measure 0.66 c (160 mL) of white liquid glue, 1/2 tsp (3 grams) of baking soda, 0.25 c (59 mL) of water, 5 drops of food colouring, and 2.5 cups of shaving foam into a bowl. Mix the ingredients with a spoon until they are fully combined. [8] X Research source Make sure to use shaving foam instead of shaving gel, as the recipe needs the fluffy consistency of the foam. To make the slime a darker colour, simply add a few more drops of food colouring. Liquid glue is also known as school glue."

Measure the contact lens solution onto the slime and then use your hands to squish the slime around in your hands for about 5 minutes. This will help to make the slime stretchy and fluffy. [9] X Research source Make sure that your contact lens solution contains boric acid, as this helps to give the mixture a slimy texture."

      "content": "Mix an extra 0.5 US tbsp (7.4 mL) of contact lens solution into the slime. Pour the contact lens solution on top of the slime. Adding the contact lens solution slowly helps to make the slime stretchier. Stretch the slime as far as you can with your fingers and then squeeze it into a ball. Continue to repeat this process until the contact lens solution is completely absorbed into the slime. [10] X Research source If it feels too sticky, add an extra drop of contact lens solutions."
