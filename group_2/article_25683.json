      "content": "Knowing your kit is helpful as when others give you advice you need to know what they are talking about. The kit is divided into two parts; the board and rig. The board is the surfboard-like part you stand on, and has one or more fins and daggerboards (on some models) underwater."

      "content": "Remember that when starting the daggerboard, it should be down at all times. You can do this by pulling the big nob towards the rear, or stern, of the board to lower and towards the front, or bow, to raise when packing away."

      "content": "Know that there will also be foot straps and a deck plate to hold the rig on. The rig consists of a sail, mast and boom. The boom is the bit you hold on to, but the mast can be used for support. A cord should run from the boom to the bottom of the mast, this is the uphaul and is used to pull the sail up. The boom often has harness lines hanging from it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice steering(called Center of Effort Steering) in the \"safety\" position. With the mast straight up tilt the mast to your left. Your body should transfer this imbalance(the center of effort of the sail is not balanced with the center of lateral resistance of the board) to the board and make the board turn(or spin) clockwise. Tilt the mast to the right and the board will turn(or spin) counterclockwise(anticlockwise). The stronger the wind and the further you tilt the faster the board will turn(or spin). In a stiff breeze you may be sailing very slowly at this point. Another steering description is as you tilt the mast to the stern the board will head up in to the wind. This is also described in the turning section of this doc. Tilting the mast to the front makes the board bear off from the wind. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Start moving. Look and see which side the bow of the board is in relation to you, and place your lower hand on the boom so the mast is leading the sail towards the bow(front). When you feel ready, transfer the other hand to the boom. Don't let the sail pull you down - the mast should be perpendicular to the board, so lean back and keep the arms straight. This is called the Number 7, and that should indicate the posture to you!"
