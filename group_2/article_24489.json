      "content": "Malwarebytes is safe if downloaded directly from the source. Malwarebytes has been some of the most recommended antimalware software for Windows and Mac for decades, known primarily for its 100% free malware scanning and removal tool. However, because of Malwarebytes' popularity, scammers often put up fake Malwarebytes websites or display fake Malwarebytes warning pop-up messages on websites that can prompt you into downloading illegitimate software. [1] X Research source To avoid getting a fake copy of Malwarebytes and potentially infecting your computer with ransomware, only download Malwarebytes from Malwarebytes.com . The only official website to download Malwarebytes is https://www.malwarebytes.com . If you're looking at a website like \"malwarebytes-premium.net,\" \"Malwarebytes.pro,\" or any other variation of that name, it is not the real Malwarebytes website— report it as phishing , if you can. If you haven't installed Malwarebytes and see a pop-up claiming the software has detected a virus, don't click the ad—it's likely from a scam site. If you receive a random phone call from somebody claiming to be from Malwarebytes technical support, either to inform you that you have a virus or to prompt you to purchase their software, hang up—the real Malwarebytes will never call you. [2] X Research source If you received an email claiming to be from Malwarebytes with a billing invoice or order confirmation, ignore it—if you didn't sign up for a Malwarebytes subscription, the email is not legitimate."
