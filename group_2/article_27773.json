      "content": "You can use Google Docs to convert a PDF to a document. Google doesn’t have a PDF editor of its own, but you can upload a PDF to Google Drive and then open it in Google Docs. This will convert the PDF into a Google Doc that you can edit. Once you are finished editing, you can download the file again in the PDF format. While this technically makes it possible to edit a PDF in Google Docs, the process won't be as seamless as using a PDF editor ."

      "title": "While you can make a PDF editable, you'll lose special formatting.",
      "content": "While you can make a PDF editable, you'll lose special formatting. When Google Docs converts a PDF to a Google Doc, it will lose much of the formatting that the PDF has. PDFs that have lots of tables, charts, diagrams, and images are especially prone to losing formatting in Google Docs, and you may spend a lot of time reformatting the text, tables, and pictures. PDFs that are mostly text-based will likely convert to an editable document with minimal formatting issues."

      "title": "Upload a PDF to Google Drive.",
      "content": "Upload a PDF to Google Drive. As long as you have a Google (Gmail) account , you can upload a PDF to Google Drive.

If the PDF contained a lot of charts, images, and special formatting, those elements may not display properly in the converted file. As a result, it may look like parts of the PDF are missing. Unfortunately, you will not be able to edit those parts in an editor like Google Docs."

      "title": "To get the best results when editing a PDF, use a PDF editing program.",
      "content": "To get the best results when editing a PDF, use a PDF editing program. Because Google Docs was not designed for PDF editing, it likely won't be the best solution for your needs. Fortunately, you can edit a PDF without altering its formatting by using programs other than Google Docs. Adobe Acrobat Pro: Use Adobe Acrobat Pro , the official PDF editor from the company that created PDF files, to add, remove, and edit text and other elements. The software is not free—you will need to subscribe to use it. Free trials are usually available. If you just need to edit a PDF once, you may be able to just use the free trial to make your edits and then cancel if you don't want to keep the software. Paid alternatives to Acrobat: For a paid alternative that allows you to buy the software once instead of subscribing on an ongoing basis, check out Master PDF Editor , PDF-Xchange , or Nitro PDF . LibreOffice Draw: This software is free and comes with LibreOffice, an alternative to Microsoft 365 (Office). You can use it to open and edit PDFs, though you may still lose some formatting (like in Google Docs). Free PDF editors: Free online PDF editors like Canva's PDF editor , SmallPDF , and PDFEscape allow you to edit a limited number of PDFs in your web browser. You can usually just use these tools to sign and fill PDFs , not edit existing text."
