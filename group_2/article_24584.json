      "title": "A “jittleyang” is a person known for being an attention grabber.",
      "content": "A “jittleyang” is a person known for being an attention grabber. According to Baltimore native, Richard Webster (also known as Bippleyipsnipp on TikTok), a “jikkle” or “jittle” means “an attention grabber.” The suffix “-yang” can be added to any word for extra flair, but it doesn’t change the meaning. So, a “jittleyang” refers to someone or something that grabs attention. [1] X Research source Although there’s no official pronunciation of “jittleyang,” most people pronounce it as “DJI-tul-yang.” However, the word is often spoken very quickly so that the middle syllable almost sounds like a glottal stop (similar to how a British English speaker might pronounce the double “t” in “butter”). Examples of how “jittleyang” is used: “Forget the jittleyangs and focus on your end goal.” “She is such a jittleyang. All the guys hit on her at the club.” “That red coat is a jittleyang, especially since people mainly wear black and neutrals.”"

      "content": "Both terms come from Baltimore rapper and barber Richard Webster. In March 2021, Richard (also known by his rap name Bibbleyipsnipp) released a song called “City Girls,” which features lyrics that are super hard to decipher. This was partly due to his Baltimore accent, which caused the song to be known as “The Baltimore Accent Song.” The song went viral on TikTok in 2023, especially since Richard continued to post popular TikTok videos of him using other slang phrases. [3] X Research source TikTokers started to make funny videos about the sounds they heard in his rap, including “jittleyang” and “fuhuhluhtoogan.”"

      "content": "The “Are you a jittleyang or fuhuhluhtoogan” meme went viral in 2024. In January 2024, TikTok user @_shawwtty posted a viral video of his little sister shouting, “Are you a jittleyang or a fuhuhluhtoogan?” to his mother. His mother looks super confused and keeps saying she doesn’t understand what her daughter is talking about. Since then, some people have been identifying as either jittleyangs or fuhuhluhtoogans, making their own lore and backstories about what they are. [4] X Research source Example: TikTok user @foodplushistory posted a video in April 2024, claiming that the jittleyangs started a war with the fuhuhluhtoogans because they stole their eggs. In the game Angry Birds, the pigs steal the eggs from the birds, meaning the pigs are jittleyangs and the birds are the fuhuhluhtoogans."

If someone does (or says) something out of pocket, you can give them the bombastic side eye by staring at them out of the corner of your eye, without turning your face. It’s a simple way to show that you’re judging them and that you don’t agree with their opinion or behavior. [5] X Research source On TikTok, “bombastic side eye, criminal offensive side eye” refers to the trend of people uploading videos of themselves reacting to uncomfortable or cringe-worthy situations."

      "content": "Bouba and Kiki Bouba and Kiki is a viral meme that actually comes from a linguistic concept where people intuitively connect certain sounds to specific shapes. One of the prime examples of this linguistic phenomenon is “bouba” and “kiki.” Regardless of lingual and cultural background, people around the world were shown to associate the sounds “bouba” and “kiki” with a rounded or spiky shape, respectively. [6] X Research source In the early 2020s, “bouba or kiki” became a viral meme on Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. People began to use “bouba or kiki” as a way to identify different objects, as well as to categorize their personality type. [7] X Research source For example, this tweet from user @Thinkwert placed two runway looks side by side—labeling one as “Kiki” and the other as “Bouba.” You can even take online personality quizzes to determine where you’re more bouba or kiki—like this one from wikiHow."
