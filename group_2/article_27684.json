      "title": "Combine your ingredients.",
      "content": "Combine your ingredients. Measure out 2 cups (474 ml) of regular Mountain Dew and pour it into a tall glass. Add in the cup (237 ml) of Gatorade and stir to combine. As the two liquids come together, the drink will take on an aquamarine color similar to Baja Blast. To make a larger batch, double or triple the quantities of each drink. Stick with a two-to-one ratio of Mountain Dew and Gatorade. [1] X Research source Even though Baja Blast has a tropical-lime flavor, the best homemade version uses Cool Blue Gatorade, and not any of the lime or tropical flavors."

      "content": "Chill and enjoy. For a refreshing cold beverage, add a few cubes of ice to the glass and serve it chilled. You can also refrigerate the drink for 30 minutes to chill it without watering it down."

      "title": "Turn the drink into a slushy.",
      "content": "Turn the drink into a slushy. You can also turn your Baja Blast into a slushy, and to do that you'll need plenty of ice and a blender. Combine the Baja Blast in the blender with about 18 cubes of ice. Blend the mixture on Snow or Ice Crush mode for about a minute, or until there are no large chunks of ice left. Transfer the slushy to a tall glass and enjoy."

      "title": "Juice and peel the fruit.",
      "content": "Juice and peel the fruit. Rinse the lemon, lime, and orange under running water and scrub the peels with a vegetable brush. Pat each dry with a towel and cut the fruits in half. Over a bowl, use a citrus reamer or juicer to remove the juice, and separate the seeds. When the juice has been removed, use your knife to carefully peel the outer layer of zest from each fruit half. Set these aside and discard what's left of the fruit."

      "title": "Make the syrup.",
      "content": "Make the syrup. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cream of tartar, and 1 cup (237 ml) of the water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Once it’s boiling, continue simmering for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and set the syrup aside to cool."

      "title": "Steep the citrus peels in boiling water.",
      "content": "Steep the citrus peels in boiling water. Boil the remaining cup (237 ml) of water in a kettle. Transfer the boiling water to a heat-safe bowl and add the zest from the lemon, lime, and orange. Cover the bowl with a towel and set it aside to steep. Let the citrus peels infuse into the water for one to two hours, until the water returns to room temperature."

      "title": "Remove the citrus and combine all the ingredients.",
      "content": "Remove the citrus and combine all the ingredients. When the citrus water has cooled, strain out the peels and reserve the water. Add the syrup and citrus juices to the citrus-infused water and stir to combine. Although this homemade mixture isn't the same color as Mountain Dew, it will have a similar citrus flavor. You can add some green and yellow food coloring if you want the soda to be a similar color."

      "title": "Carbonate the drink.",
      "content": "Carbonate the drink. There are several ways to carbonate drinks at home. The simplest method is adding carbonated water, which you can either buy at the store or make yourself with a home carbonation machine. To carbonate your Mountain Dew this way, add enough carbonated water (up to a gallon (3.8 L)) to achieve the level of fizziness you want for the soda. You can also carbonate your homemade soda using dry ice or champagne yeast. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Whip the cream. Before making your whipped cream, place the bowl and the beaters into the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Once chilled, pour the whipping cream into the bowl and beat on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about nine minutes. [3] X Research source Keep the cream in the refrigerator until it’s time to whip it. It’s important to chill everything before whipping because this will help incorporate air into the cream better."

      "title": "Fold in the milk and Mountain Dew.",
      "content": "Fold in the milk and Mountain Dew. Add the sweetened condensed milk to the whipped cream and gently fold it in with a rubber spatula. Once that is fully incorporated, add the Mountain Dew and gently fold it in. Folding is a baking technique used to combine ingredients with different densities. To fold ingredients into the whipped cream, use the rubber spatula to scoop whipped cream from the bottom of the bowl and fold it around the other ingredients. This will protect the air bubbles making the whipped cream light and airy. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Add the food coloring.",
      "content": "Add the food coloring. To start, add five drops of yellow food coloring and two drops of green to the bowl with the ice cream base. Stir to combine. Add more food coloring if necessary, until you achieve the desired level of intensity. [5] X Research source You can also play around with the color ratios to achieve a different color. For instance, try adding an extra drop of green, or fewer drops of yellow to the mix."

      "title": "Freeze before serving.",
      "content": "Freeze before serving. Transfer the ice cream base to a freezer-safe bowl. Cover the top with a layer of plastic wrap to protect it from freezer burn. Press the plastic wrap down so it’s almost touching the top of the mixture. Put on the air-tight lid and transfer the mixture to the freezer. Ideally, let the ice cream chill overnight, or for six to eight hours at least. When the ice cream is thoroughly chilled, portion it out with an ice cream scoop and enjoy. [6] X Research source"
