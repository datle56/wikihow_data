      "content": "Heat 2 cups (473 ml) water in a microwave or a pot, bringing it to a boil. Get an adult to help you if you're not allowed to use the stove--boiling water can be extremely dangerous if you spill it on yourself. [1] X Research source If you don't have access to a stove, you can use a microwave instead. Combine the sugar and water in a microwave-safe glass and heat it for two minutes on high. Stir the sugar water and microwave for another 2 minutes. Stir the mixture a third time and the sugar should dissolve almost entirely into the water. Use purified water if possible. The sugar can attach to impurities in the tap water and create a crust that will prevent water from evaporating and prevent the crystals from growing on your string instead. [2] X Research source Make sure you handle the pot or microwave-safe glass with hot pads or oven mitts so you don't burn yourself."

      "content": "Stir in the 4 cups (946 g) of sugar in 1/2 cup (118 g) increments. Stir with a spoon after each addition until the sugar is dissolved into the water. As the water becomes more saturated with sugar, it will take longer for it to dissolve in the water. It may take as long as two minutes for the sugar to dissolve. Stir the solution until the water is clear. If the solution is cloudy or you find the sugar stops dissolving, turn the heat up so the water reaches a vigorous boil. [3] X Research source Hot water has a higher saturation point than cool water, so turning up the heat should allow you to mix in the rest of the sugar."

If undissolved sugar ends up in the jar or glass where you grow the rock candy, crystals will attach to the undissolved sugar and not to your string or stick. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source If you have undissolved sugar that didn't mix with the boiling water, you may want to pour the solution through a strainer and only retain the liquid. The solution you have made is a super-saturated solution, meaning the water has absorbed more sugar than it would have absorbed at room temperature. As the solution cools, the water saturation point of the water will become lower, and it will no longer be able to hold the amount of sugar. The dissolved sugar will be unable to stay in liquid form, and will instead crystallize on the string or stick you provide. [5] X Research source"

Try to coordinate the color to the flavor--blue with blueberry, red with strawberry, purple with grape--so the flavor is clear. Make sure you stir the solution thoroughly so the flavor and color is evenly distributed. [6] X Research source You only need a few drops of flavoring, but try to make the solution dark with color for the best results. [7] X Research source Try mixing in drink mix, like Kool-Aid, for color and flavor. Try adding a splash of fruit juice for lemon, lime, orange, or other fruity flavored candy. Try different extracts like peppermint, strawberry, vanilla, or even banana."

      "content": "Pour the solution into a large glass or jar where you plan to grow your rock candy crystals. The glass or jar should be tall and cylindrical and made of glass--plastic may melt when you pour in the hot solution. Fill the glass almost to the top. Make sure the glass is clean and contains no dust particles. Even dust can give the sugar crystals something to cling to, and you only want them to settle and grow on your string or stick. [8] X Research source Cover the glass with a piece of wax or parchment paper to prevent dust from settling on the top of the solution. [9] X Research source This recipe, since it uses only one large jar of glass, yields one candy. If you want to make multiple small candies or do not have a large jar, you can divide the solution into smaller jars. The yield would then be as many as your jars."

      "content": "Tie one end of a string around the middle of a pencil and tie a weight (such as a paperclip) to the other end. The paperclip will act as a weight and keep your string hanging straight down so it doesn't touch the sides. The string should be about 2/3 as long as the glass is deep--it should not be long enough that the weight will touch the bottom of the glass. This will give your crystals plenty of space to grow. [10] X Research source Touching or hanging too close to the bottom or sides of the glass could make your crystals smaller or misshapen. Use a string made from natural fiber, like twine or cotton. Fishing twine or nylon string are too smooth and it will be difficult for the sugar crystals to find crevices to cling to and grow. [11] X Research source You can also use a washer or screw to weight the string, or even another piece of rock candy, which may help your crystals grow faster. [12] X Research source The pencil should be long enough that it can rest on the top of the glass without falling in. You can also use a butter knife, skewer, or popsicle stick instead. A butter knife or popsicle stick may be more stable, as they can lay flat on top of the glass and won't roll."

As the water evaporates, you will see a few crystals form on the string. These are seed crystals and they will help larger crystals grow around these points. [13] X Research source You must make sure the string is completely dry before you proceed to the next step and be very careful not to knock off any of the seed crystals when you place the string in the solution. [14] X Research source You can skip this step or try to speed it along by wetting the string and rolling it in granulated sugar (just make sure the string is completely dry before you put it in the glass and the sugar isn't falling off), but making seed crystals will make your rock candy grow faster and increase your chances of success in growing crystals.

The string should hang straight down and never come in contact with the bottom or sides of the glass. Cover the solution with a paper towel. You don't want to seal the glass with something that will keep the air out, like plastic wrap, as evaporation is an essential part of this process. As the water evaporates, the remaining solution becomes more saturated with sugar, and the water must force the sugar out. The sugar molecules will collect on the string, forming your rock candy crystals. [16] X Research source Tape the pencil to the jar to keep it from rolling or moving while your crystals form."

Allow the skewers to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.
