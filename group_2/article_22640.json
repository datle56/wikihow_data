      "content": "Schedule your piercing appointment appropriately. If you are trying to keep your new piercing a secret, you need to be mindful about when you get it done. There will be a healing timeframe during which your tongue may swell significantly which can noticeably alter how you sound when you talk. Try to plan your piercing during a time when you can avoid people for at least a few days to give yourself time to heal."

      "content": "Choose the ball for your jewelry wisely. Try to pick a clear plastic ball or a flesh-colored ball for the ends of your tongue piercing barbell. These will be less obvious than flashy metal or a colorful ball, so they are easier to hide."

      "content": "Get a clear plastic retainer. The best way to minimize visibility of a new piercing is by getting a clear plastic retainer. These are much harder to see, especially in a darker place like inside your mouth. However, these plastic jewelry options are not good for fresh piercings. You need to give your tongue piercing several months of healing time before you use any plastic jewelry in it. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid telling people about your tongue piercing.",
      "content": "Avoid telling people about your tongue piercing. People talk. The more people who know about your tongue piercing, the more likely it is that someone you don’t want to know will find out about it. Don’t tell anyone you don’t trust and avoid talking about your piercing in general if you want it to remain a secret."

      "title": "Be careful about how you hold your mouth when you talk.",
      "content": "Be careful about how you hold your mouth when you talk. Tongue piercings can be difficult to hide because they are in such a visible area. Avoid opening your mouth too widely when you are talking or laughing. Avoid yelling, screaming, or singing (or other activities that require you to open your mouth widely) in front of people you want to hide the piercing from. Practice in the mirror to see what methods conceal your piercing the most."

      "content": "Stay away from people you want to hide it from. When possible, avoid the people you don’t want to know about your new piercing. It would be a better idea to take some days off work while your piercing heals than to go to work with an obviously swollen tongue."
