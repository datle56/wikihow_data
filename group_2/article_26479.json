Include moderate to vigorous intensity exercise a few times a week and focus on exercises that involve intervals to aid in fat burning. This will help burn calories from fat in addition to boosting your cardiovascular health. [4] X Research source Aim to include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity (where you can say a short sentence fairly easily) activity each week. However, adding in vigorous activity (where you can't say more than one to two words at a time) burns more calories per minute.

Swimming, cycling, boxing, and tennis all offer effective alternatives to running and elliptical machines. If you're not quite ready for vigorous exercise, start walking briskly on a treadmill at an uphill climb, use a stationary bike, or get acquainted with an elliptical machine. You can do these at a level catered to your ability. To lose the most amount of fat, a combination of weight training and cardio is the most effective exercise plan. [6] X Research source"

Although cardio burns more calories in the short-term, weight lifting or strength training helps build lean muscle mass that can increase how many calories you burn over the long-term. [7] X Research source Include at least 20 minutes of strength training at least two times a week. However, the more time you spend doing strength training exercises, the more lean muscle mass you can build.

      "content": "Include interval training. Exercise does increase your metabolism, but interval training does so even more. High-intensity interval training has been shown to be more effective at burning calories from fat than other forms of exercise. [10] X Research source Interval training has also been shown to increase your metabolism and keep it raised for up to 24 hours after your work out. [11] X Research source Interval training is a short workout that alternates between short bursts of very high intensity activity and moderate intensity activity. These workouts should last between 15-25 minutes and you should feel very, very out of breath at the end of the workout. [12] X Research source Interval training can be difficult and may not be appropriate for all fitness levels. Always speak to your doctor and take your first interval training workout slowly until you feel comfortable with it."

      "content": "Increase your lifestyle activity. Lifestyle activity are activities and movement that you do in a typical day. Increasing how much you move throughout your daily routine can help burn more calories and fat. Lifestyle activity typically falls into low to moderate intensity exercise. That means you're active and your heart rate is raised slightly but you're not out of breath. Activities may include: walking to and from your car, walking while you shop for groceries, taking the stairs to your office or household chores (like mopping or gardening). These types of activities fall into a category known as the \"fat burning zone.\" Although you burn less calories overall in this zone, the calories burned are primarily from fat stores. A combination of planned exercise (like a 30 minute jog) in addition to increased lifestyle activity (like parking your car farther from the door) can help you lose a significant amount of fat mass."

Take great caution prior to consuming any diet pills. Do not take any over-the-counter medications without consulting with your doctor first. These medications may interfere with your prescription medications or current health conditions. Avoid pills or products that claim quick or easy weight fixes.
