      "content": "Understand healthy relationship boundaries. Although you want to help your romantic partner as much as possible, sometimes depression may make it impossible to maintain the relationship. If your partner cannot relate to you in a healthy manner, the relationship just may not be feasible. This does not mean a depressed person cannot have a fulfilling relationship--many people dealing with depression do. However, depression can cause deep problems in a relationship. Remember: A relationship is is not a marriage. As partner, you have a right to break it off if it is not working for you. You are not a bad person if you discontinue a relationship with a person who is not able at this point to offer much to you and especially not if it is not supporting you. It is important for you to know what you want out of a romantic relationship, and consider if you are getting what you need. It is not selfish to put yourself and your needs first. Especially as an independent adult, no one is patrolling your needs. You have to care for yourself before you care for others. Sometimes depression can make a person unable to maintain a romantic relationship. That is not a reflection on you, as the significant other, nor does it mean you are somehow deficient. Just loving someone does not mean you can necessarily overcome what can be a significant mental illness. Depression is not an excuse for abuse, manipulation, or other poor treatment. Depressed people are more prone to behaviors that are negative. However, if your significant other is not in control, that does not absolve him or her of responsibility. In fact, you may have to remove yourself from the situation to protect yourself. It is not your responsibility to manage his reaction to a break-up. A real fear after a break-up with a depressed boyfriend is that he will do something dramatic, including suicide. But you cannot control his actions. If you do have concerns that your ex may harm himself or others, get help. Do not allow yourself to be trapped in a relationship you fear to leave."
