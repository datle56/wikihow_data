      "content": "Trim a piece of plywood to 36 in × 26 in (91 cm × 66 cm) with a circular saw . Choose a flat sheet of plywood from your local home improvement store, and mark the dimensions with a pencil. Use a circular saw to cut the plywood down to size, and then smooth out the cut edges with 200-grit sandpaper . [1] X Research source Licensed contractor Lui Colmenares states, “The most important thing when you use a saw is to have goggles” to protect your eyes while you’re working. Almost all 500- and 1,000-piece puzzles will fit on this board with extra room to spread out the pieces, but you can cut the board smaller or larger based on what you need. Most stores will cut plywood to the size you need when you buy it if you don’t have access to tools at home."

      "content": "Cut 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) trim pieces to frame the edges of the puzzle board. Choose your favorite decorative trim from your local home improvement store. Then, use your circular saw to cut the pieces. To finish your puzzle board, cut your trim so you have: [2] X Research source 2 pieces that are 36 in (0.91 m) long 2 pieces that are 26 in (0.66 m) long If you’d rather not cut and put together your own puzzle board, using a pre-built bulletin board works great as a puzzle board."

      "title": "Saw 45-degree angles into the ends of the trim pieces.",
      "content": "Saw 45-degree angles into the ends of the trim pieces. Cutting angles in the ends of the trim helps them fit together seamlessly when you attach them. Draw 45-degree angles from the outer corners on the ends of each trim piece. Then, cut along the lines with your circular saw. When you’re finished, each trim piece will have a trapezoid shape. [3] X Research source If you don’t want to cut angles into your trim pieces, just cut the shorter trim pieces to 25 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.65 m) instead. This creates a simpler joint without extra cutting. Place the trim in a miter box to line up the angled cut perfectly."

      "content": "Glue the trim around the plywood edges and let it dry for 30 minutes. Apply a line of wood glue to the bottom of each trim piece and press it flat on top of the plywood so they align with the edges. Fit the trim pieces together so the angled cuts line up, and secure them together with hand clamps . Let the glue set for at least 30 minutes before you continue your build. [4] X Research source Clamping ensures the trim doesn’t move around while the glue dries so it bonds completely."

      "title": "Stain your puzzle board if you want to change its color.",
      "content": "Stain your puzzle board if you want to change its color. Find a wood stain color you like and apply a thin coat to the wood with a paintbrush. After about 15 minutes, wipe the stain off with a clean cloth and let it dry for a few hours. Then, you can apply a second coat if you want a richer or darker color. [5] X Research source Be sure to open windows and work in a well-ventilated area while you’re staining to prevent fumes from building up."

      "content": "Screw handles into the short trim pieces. Any decorative cabinet handle works well for your puzzle board. Hold the handles against the tops or outsides of the short trim pieces, and mark the screw locations. Drill holes through the trim for the screws. Then, just screw the handles tightly into the trim pieces. [6] X Research source If you plan on storing your puzzle board underneath furniture when you’re not using it, make sure to use short handles that don’t stick up too far."

Get a sheet of particleboard and lengths of wood trim from your local hardware store. Use a circular saw to cut the wood pieces to the following sizes: [7] X Research source 36 in × 26 in (91 cm × 66 cm) particleboard pieces (2) 35 in × 13 in (89 cm × 33 cm) particleboard piece (1) 35 in (89 cm) pieces of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) square wood trim (3) 25 1 ⁄ 2 in (65 cm) pieces of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) square wood trim (2) 12 in (30 cm) pieces of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) square wood trim (2) 36 in (91 cm) piece of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) square wood trim (1) 36 in (91 cm) pieces of 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) wood trim (2) 25 1 ⁄ 2 in (65 cm) pieces of 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) wood trim (2)"

      "content": "Secure 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) trim along 3 edges of the large particleboard. Set the particleboard so the rough side faces down. Attach the longest trim piece along the top edge of the particleboard with wood glue and attach the 25 1 ⁄ 2 in (65 cm) pieces to the short sides so they’re flush with the edges. Let the glue dry for 30 minutes. Then flip your puzzle board over and use a nail gun to drive nails every 6 inches (15 cm) through the particleboard and into the trim. [8] X Research source The first piece of particleboard and trim pieces create the bottom frame for your puzzle board."

Glue a 35 in (89 cm) trim piece horizontally across the mark. Leave the glue to set for 30 minutes and then flip the puzzle board over to secure nails every 6 inches (15 cm) along the trim.

Let the glue set for 30 minutes before unclamping the pieces. [10] X Research source The top piece of particleboard forms the work surface where you build your puzzle."

Place the 4 trim pieces along the edges so they’re flush with the sides. Apply lines of wood glue to the backs of the trim pieces and clamp them to the particleboard for 30 minutes to dry. [12] X Research source Position a cabinet handle onto the front of a long trim piece on the drawer and mark the hole locations. Drill holes into the trim and use a screwdriver to attach the handle so you can easily pull the drawer open.

Try sliding the drawer into the open slot on your puzzle board. If you can easily push it in and pull it out, then you’re finished! [13] X Research source If the drawer still gets caught or stuck, then sand the trim pieces more so it can move smoothly."

Get enough material so it’s 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) longer than each side of the tri-fold board. Spread white school glue on the front of the display board and press it flat onto the felt or paper, and give it a few minutes to dry. [14] X Research source Tri-fold display boards are a great starting point since the flaps can fold over and protect the puzzle when you’re not working on it."

Cut strips of cardboard that are 1 in (2.5 cm) wide to the edge lengths. Apply hot glue to the back of the strips and press them along the edges on the front of your puzzle board. These strips become the frame that prevents puzzle pieces from sliding off the board.

Measure halfway down the height of the board and make a dot on each fold 1 in (2.5 cm) from where they touch in the middle. Make a 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) loop of felt or ribbon and glue it down to one flap. Glue a button to the spot on the other flap to finish your board. [17] X Research source When you work on your puzzle, make it in the middle section of the tri-fold board. When you want to put it away, just fold the flaps over and wrap the loop around the button to keep your puzzle safe."
