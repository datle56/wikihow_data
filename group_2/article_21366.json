      "title": "Verify that the location is warm enough.",
      "content": "Verify that the location is warm enough. Nutmeg is a tropical tree that must be grown outdoors, so it requires a hot, humid climate. In order to grow, nutmeg shouldn’t be planted in locations with a minimum temperature below 30°F (-1°C). Ideally, it requires an average temperature between 77°F and 95°F (25°C and 35°C). [1] X Research source Nutmeg trees also grow best in climates that experience at least 60 inches (152-cm) of annual rainfall. You can usually find out your area's annual rainfall from your country's national weather or meteorology bureau website. The roots don’t do well in soggy conditions, though, so it’s best to plant the tree on a slope to provide effective drainage."

      "title": "Check the soil’s pH level.",
      "content": "Check the soil’s pH level. Nutmeg grows best in soil that is neutral or slightly acidic. Ideally, your soil should have a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, though it can tolerate a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. [2] X Research source Nutmeg is best suited for clay loam, sandy loam, and red laterite soils. You can test your soil’s pH with a testing kit from your local garden supply store or nursery. They usually require digging a hole in the soil and filling it with distilled water. Next, you insert a test probe and wait for the results according to the kit’s instructions. If your soil's pH is above 7.0, you can make it more acidic by about 1- to 2-inches (2.5 to 5-cm) of sphagnum peat into the soil when you plant the nutmeg. If your soil's pH is below 5.5, you can make it a little less acidic by covering the planting area with a layer of limestone and mixing it into the soil."

      "title": "Find a sunny spot with light afternoon shade.",
      "content": "Find a sunny spot with light afternoon shade. Nutmeg trees grow best in direct sun. Ideally, they should receive 12 hours of sunlight daily for healthy growth. It’s a good idea to plant nutmeg in spot where it will receive light shade between noon and 4pm, though, so it doesn’t become too dry."

      "title": "Sterilize a knife.",
      "content": "Sterilize a knife. In order to plant nutmeg from seeds, you need to separate it from the mace producing aril that covers the seed. Find a small, sharp knife, and wipe the blade with a piece of paper towel dampened with rubbing alcohol to sterilize it. [3] X Research source If you prefer, you can dip the knife’s blade in a pot of boiling water to sterilize it."

      "title": "Cut the aril from the base of the seed and peel it off.",
      "content": "Cut the aril from the base of the seed and peel it off. Once your knife is sterilized, use it to slice into the aril at the base where it connects to the seed. Carefully peel the aril away, making sure that you don’t damage the nut. [4] X Research source The aril is the red, lace-like substance that covers the seed. The aril from a nutmeg is used to make mace. You can discard the aril, or set it out in a dry, sunny area for about 15 days until it dries out and turns brown. You can then grind it into mace."

      "title": "Soak the nuts in water for a day.",
      "content": "Soak the nuts in water for a day. Nutmeg seeds germinate best when they’re fresh and moist. Place your seeds in a small bowl, and cover them with clean water. Allow them to soak for 24 hours before planting them. [5] X Research source If you don’t want to plant the nutmeg right away, store the seeds in a sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator. Plant them within 6 weeks."

      "title": "Fill a pot with soil.",
      "content": "Fill a pot with soil. To plant the nutmeg, add a free-draining soil to a 5-inch (13-cm) pot. The pot should have drainage holes in the bottom to ensure that the roots don’t become soggy. [6] X Research source Clay loam, sandy loam, or red laterite soil is the best option for planting nutmeg."

      "title": "Water the pot thoroughly.",
      "content": "Water the pot thoroughly. When the seed is planted beneath the surface, pour some clean water over the pot. Continue watering the pot until the water appears through the drainage holes and allow it to drain fully in the sink. [8] X Research source Tap water works well for watering the nutmeg, but make sure that it’s not softened water, which often contains salt."

      "content": "Set the pot in a warm area to sprout. Once the nutmeg seed is planted and watered, place it in a sunny indoor or outdoor location where the temperature is between 77°F and 86°F (25°C and 30°C). Watch the pot closely as you wait for the nutmeg to sprout, which usually takes a month or longer. [9] X Research source Be sure to water the pot regularly as you wait for the nutmeg to sprout. The soil should constantly be moist without puddles forming on the surface."

      "title": "Store the tree where it receives several hours of sun daily.",
      "content": "Store the tree where it receives several hours of sun daily. A newly germinated nutmeg tree should be kept indoors. However, it requires a spot that receives four to six hours of sunlight a day for healthy growth. [10] X Research source In front of a west-facing window is an ideal spot for a young nutmeg tree if you are in the northern hemisphere."

      "title": "Move it to larger containers as necessary.",
      "content": "Move it to larger containers as necessary. When the tree is young, it can outgrow its container(s) quickly. If its roots fill the base of the current pot, it’s time to move it to a large container. Increase the size of the pot by 2-inches (5-cm) to ensure that it’s large enough. [13] X Research source You can usually tell that the roots have filled the base of the current pot when they start to protrude from the drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the new container with the same type of soil that you used initially. Set the tree in the new pot so the surface of the soil is 1-inch (2.5-cm) below the rim. Water the tree thoroughly after moving it and allow it to drain. You’ll know the tree is large enough to move outside when its roots take up a 5 gallon (19 liter) pot, which usually takes approximately 6 months. It’s best to plant it outdoors in late spring, though."

      "content": "Keep an eye out for diseases and pests. Nutmeg can suffer from fungal infections, such as fruit rot and thread blight. It is also prone to damage from insects such as black, white, and shield scale. Watch your trees carefully, and treat them as soon as you notice signs of a disease or pest. [23] X Research source Symptoms of fruit rot include water-logged spots on the fruit and rotted seeds and avrils. You can treat the disease with a fungicide such as 1% Bordeaux mixture. [24] X Research source Symptoms of thread blight include fine white or black threads on the underside of the leaves. You can treat the disease with a fungicide such as 1% Bordeaux mixture. You can tell that your nutmeg tree is suffering black, white, or shield scale damage if you observe black, white, or brown fish scale-like pests in clusters on the stems and lower surfaces of the leaves. Treat the infestation with a pesticide such as dimethoate."
