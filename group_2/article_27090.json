      "title": "Mix together craft glue, dish soap, and water in a mixing bowl.",
      "content": "Mix together craft glue, dish soap, and water in a mixing bowl. Use 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of craft glue, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap, and 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of water. Use a medium-sized mixing bowl so you'll have enough space to work once the slime starts to puff out. Stir everything together until it becomes foamy. [1] X Research source When working with kids, give them their own bowls so they can enjoy making their own slime."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze 4 to 5 drops of your favorite food coloring into the bowl.",
      "content": "Squeeze 4 to 5 drops of your favorite food coloring into the bowl. Add more drops for a deeper color or fewer drops for a paler shade. Mix and match primary colors to teach kids how different shades are made. [2] X Research source For example, mix together yellow and blue to create green. You can use either gel or liquid food coloring."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir in 1 cup (180 grams) of baking soda.",
      "content": "Stir in 1 cup (180 grams) of baking soda. Measure out the baking soda and use a long-handled spoon to mix it in with the soap and glue. Don't use your hands yet! Stir the mixture until there are no visible clumps of baking soda left. [3] X Research source The mixture will be super sticky at the beginning, and it will stick to your hands and get under your nails."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue adding baking soda until the slime isn't sticky to the touch.",
      "content": "Continue adding baking soda until the slime isn't sticky to the touch. Add the baking soda in 1/4 cup (45 grams) increments until it becomes pliable and smooth. Test the slime by pressing down on it with your fingers—if it clings to them, continue adding baking soda. [4] X Research source If you accidentally add too much baking soda, add 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 tablespoon (7.4 to 14.8 mL) of dish soap to return its elasticity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your slime in an airtight container",
      "content": "Keep your slime in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days. After you've finished playing with the slime, put it into a plastic container with a lid. Enjoy it for the next couple of days, and throw it out once it gets runny. [5] X Research source This is a great slime for kids who have sensitive skin! And it makes your hands smell great, too."

    {
      "title": "Mix together cornstarch, dish soap, and little bit of water.",
      "content": "Mix together cornstarch, dish soap, and little bit of water. Use 1/2 cup (62.5 grams) of cornstarch, 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL) of dish soap, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water. Use a spoon to mix things at the beginning, but once the cornstarch has mostly been incorporated to the dish soap, feel free to use your hands! The water makes the soap get a little sudsy, which gives the slime a foamy texture."

    {
      "title": "Add in glitter or other small objects to create a sensory experience.",
      "content": "Add in glitter or other small objects to create a sensory experience. Add 1 tablespoon (9 grams) of glitter for some sparkly fun. Add in dry rice or beans to create a cool sensory experience for your kids. Even beads, small action figures, or jelly foam cubes can be fun additions to slime. Just make sure the child who will be playing with the slime is old enough to not swallow any of the small items."

    {
      "title": "Use more cornstarch for too-sticky slime or more water for chalky slime.",
      "content": "Use more cornstarch for too-sticky slime or more water for chalky slime. Depending on the humidity where you live, you may need to adjust the proportions of the recipe slightly. Fix sticky slime by adding another tablespoon (9 grams) of cornstarch. Combat chalky or crumbly slime by adding 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water. Of course, if you prefer sticky slime, just add more water until it gets to the consistency you'd like."

      "title": "Store the slime in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks.",
      "content": "Store the slime in an airtight container for 2 to 3 weeks. When you're done playing with your slime, put it into a plastic container that has a lid. When you want to use it again, just massage it with your hands a few times to work out any stiffness, and enjoy! [6] X Research source Once the slime has dried out, it's time to throw it out and make a new batch."

      "title": "Combine dish soap and toothpaste until all the toothpaste is dissolved.",
      "content": "Combine dish soap and toothpaste until all the toothpaste is dissolved. Use 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of dish soap and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of toothpaste. Mix them together with a spoon for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the toothpaste has completely dissolved in the soap. [7] X Research source Don't use your hands at this stage, as the mixture will stick to your skin and will be hard to get off."

      "title": "Add a pinch of salt to the mixture and stir it for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Add a pinch of salt to the mixture and stir it for 1 minute. Use about a 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of table salt. Stir it into the soap and toothpaste mixture for at least 1 minute so that it can start to react with the other ingredients. [8] X Research source The ions in the salt thicken the mixture and make it gel together, which creates the characteristic slime texture."

      "title": "Squeeze in 1 to 2 drops of food coloring if you want colored slime.",
      "content": "Squeeze in 1 to 2 drops of food coloring if you want colored slime. You could even separate out your slime into separate batches and made multiple colors for a cool effect. Add in more drops of food coloring for a darker shade, or mix and match primary drops to create other colors. Glitter also makes a cool addition to slime."

      "title": "Cool the mixture in the fridge for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Cool the mixture in the fridge for 1 hour. After you mix in the salt, put the entire bowl into the fridge and set a timer for 1 hour. There's no need to cover the slime, but it won't hurt anything if you do. [9] X Research source Cooling the slime makes the mixture congeal together. If you skip putting it in the fridge, the slime won't have the right consistency."

      "content": "Mix the slime with your hands one more time and enjoy! Take the slime out of the fridge and loosen it from the edges of the bowl with your fingers. Massage the slime and then remove it completely from the bowl. [10] X Research source Try to keep this slime away from your clothes, furniture, and carpet. It has a looser structure than some other slimes and it stains and sticks to things more easily."

      "content": "Store the slime in an airtight container for 1 to 2 days. Use a plastic, airtight container to store your slime. Enjoy it for a few days, but get rid of it once it doesn't hold together anymore. [11] X Research source You could always try incorporating the old slime with a batch of new slime to see if you can give it new life."
