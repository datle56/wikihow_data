      "title": "He’s letting you know you’re on his mind.",
      "content": "He’s letting you know you’re on his mind. Whether that’s with a casual “Hello” or asking what you’re up to, a guy who’s comfortable texting you first definitely likes you, even if it’s just as a friend. That being said, it’s important to reciprocate if you’re interested in him; being the one to text first sometimes can reassure him that you like talking with him. [1] X Research source “Hi there! Heard you moved to Houston. How are you liking it?” “Hey Maddie! I had a great time last night. Hope we can hang again!” “Hey! It’s been a minute. How’s it going?” XD"

      "title": "If he’s reaching out to you every day, he likes you.",
      "content": "If he’s reaching out to you every day, he likes you. This could particularly be the case if you work together, go to school together, or are in the same friend group and see each other rather frequently to begin with. “I know I saw you at Mike’s last night, but I feel like we didn’t get to catch up!” “Missed you in class today! Is everything okay?” “My shift was so boring after you left. When are we working together again?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Is he texting you with random questions?",
      "content": "Is he texting you with random questions? If so, he might just be coming up with excuses to start a conversation with you. While he might genuinely need something if he sends an unprompted text, he’s probably looking for a casual starting point for a longer conversation. [2] X Research source “Hey, did you take pre-calc last year? Any chance I could borrow your notes?” “Hi! My mom wanted me to ask if your parents need a new lawnmower? We’re selling ours.” “Hey! I’m visiting Boston today. You have family here, right?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s reaching beyond just asking what you’re up to.",
      "content": "He’s reaching beyond just asking what you’re up to. A guy will show his interest by asking questions about your hobbies, interests, friends, and family among other things. You can show him you’re equally interested by asking similar questions about him. [3] X Research source “What’s your all-time favorite food?” “My little brother can be so annoying. Do you get along with your siblings?” “I’m loving the new Mac Miller album. Who’s your favorite artist?”"

      "title": "He’s getting playful when he’s adding emojis to his texts.",
      "content": "He’s getting playful when he’s adding emojis to his texts.

      "content": "Faster responses to your texts means he’s excited to talk to you. While some people may try to play it cool by waiting longer to respond, if it only takes a few minutes for him to get back to you, he’s probably interested. [5] X Research source “Sorry to make you wait! I’d love to hang out this weekend!”"

    {
      "title": "Even if it feels like you’ve reached a dead end, he keeps texting.",
      "content": "Even if it feels like you’ve reached a dead end, he keeps texting. A guy may draw out a conversation or a joke even when it feels like it should have reached a natural end in order to keep talking to you, and if the conversation has really gone stale, he might introduce a new topic. [6] X Research source “Anyways, do you have any plans this weekend?” “I’m glad we’re on the same page. Now, are you a dog person or a cat person?” “That’s enough from me about Formula One! What’s your favorite sport?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He won’t leave you on read.",
      "content": "He won’t leave you on read. Instead of not responding or waiting until later to say that he’s busy, a guy will let you know if he can’t text. It shows that he wants to keep talking but needs to take a short break before getting back to you. “Hey! Can’t talk right now, I’m driving.” “About to board my flight! I’ll text you when I land.” “I’m not gonna have service when I go camping this weekend, but I’ll let you know when I’m back.”"

      "content": "If he’s opening up with you in his texts, he wants you to get to know him.

      "content": "This is a great sign that a guy wants to get to know you better. Sometimes he might come right out and say that he wants to hang out, but if he’s feeling shy or unsure of how you feel, he may just suggest you catch up some time with a low stakes activity you both enjoy. “Did you see the trailer for the new Harry Styles movie? We should go see it together!” “I can’t believe you’ve never been mini golfing! I have to take you!” “You like Dua Lipa too? We should buy tickets to see her!”"

What are you up to?” “I’ve been out fishing with my friends all day. Look what I caught!” “You won’t believe what my buddy just did 😂”"

He may just ask simple questions about whether you're seeing anyone, what your type is, or if you’ve dated anyone in the past. Be sure to communicate if any of these types of questions make you uncomfortable. “So your friend William? Are you guys together?” “Is that your ex who commented on your Instagram?” “I heard Nick is going to ask you to the dance. He doesn’t really seem like your type.”"

How are you today?” “I’m off to bed! I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” “Good morning! Any chance you want to catch that movie some time this weekend?”"
