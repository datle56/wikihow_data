      "title": "Avoid common hiding places.",
      "content": "Avoid common hiding places. Sock drawers, pillowcases, and the area under your bed are all pretty obvious places. Think about the hiding places you would search first if you were looking for something, then steer clear of those. [1] X Research source When searching for something, people tend to look in the most obvious places first. If you hide something in such a place, someone is sure to find it."

      "title": "Pick spots where your family members or roommates are least likely to go.",
      "content": "Pick spots where your family members or roommates are least likely to go. If someone seldom visits a room, then they are not likely going to come across whatever it is that you are hiding. For example, if no one ever goes into the basement or the linen closet, then those are safe hiding options. Some bad examples include: If your sister comes into your room to use your lotion every morning, an old lotion bottle probably isn’t the best hiding spot. If your roommate likes to borrow books from your bookshelf, you should probably hide your secret notes elsewhere."

      "title": "Go for places that you can access pretty easily.",
      "content": "Go for places that you can access pretty easily. This is important if you want to take out your secret items often. If getting to your hiding spot could cause a loud avalanche in your closet, attracting the attention of parents and snooping siblings, you should probably pick a different location. [2] X Research source In the same way, you should be able to reach an item without taking everything out of your drawers or tearing up your bookcase."

      "title": "Remember your hiding spots.",
      "content": "Remember your hiding spots. If you have many different hiding spots, keeping track of all your goodies could get confusing. Write a simple note in your phone or computer to help you remember. If you want to write down your hiding places on paper, you’ll need to hide the paper, too. Keep your note vague to throw off nosy family members. For example, if you hid a secret letter in the pages of the book Tom Sawyer, you could simply write “Tom” in your notes to remind you. You can also use little tricks to help you remember your hiding spots. If you hid your money in the pocket of a green shirt in your closet, you could think: “Money is green, and so I hid my money in the green shirt.”"

      "content": "Use the battery compartments of your electronics to stash tiny items. If you have a few electronic devices that you don’t use much anymore, like a beaten-up radio or an old gaming console, take out the batteries and slide your tiny valuables into the battery compartment. Then, replace the back. Make sure that no one else uses these items. If someone tries to use the TV remote and it doesn't work, the first thing they'll do is check the battery compartment."

      "content": "Slip flat items into the back of picture frames. Open your picture frame and take out the cardboard backing. Then, place small, flat items, like secret notes or cash, on top of the picture. Replace the cardboard backing, and you’ve got an awesome hiding place. [3] X Research source This may also work for framed mirrors, as long as they have a backing, like on a picture frame."

      "title": "Put items in empty product containers.",
      "content": "Put items in empty product containers. Old containers, like empty deodorant sticks, sunscreen bottles, or pill containers, are great places to house your treasures. Large lotion bottles can work well for bigger items. Make sure that this isn't an item that anyone else in your house uses. If they realize that the container is empty, they may toss it--along with whatever it is that you're hiding. Use this for personal items, such as a lotion bottle in your room that only you use."

      "title": "Stash goodies in the soil of potted plants.",
      "content": "Stash goodies in the soil of potted plants. Put your goodies in plastic baggies and bury them in the soil of your potted plants. If you don’t have any, it may be a good idea to buy one or two for secret stashing. Make sure the baggie is tightly sealed. You don’t want soil and water ruining your treasures! This can also work outside. Place an inconspicuous stone or figurine (such as a lawn gnome) over the hiding spot to mark it."

      "title": "Store items between your trash can and the trash bag.",
      "content": "Store items between your trash can and the trash bag. Take out the trash bag and put some of your goodies in the trash can. Then, replace the trash bag on top. Who would think to look for your most prized possessions in the garbage? Only use this method if you take out your own trash. If your mom or dad does it, then they could find your secret stash! You can also do this is you line your laundry basket with a sack. Just slip your prized possession between the basket and the sack."

      "title": "Put some goodies in the pockets of your clothing.",
      "content": "Put some goodies in the pockets of your clothing. Pick a few neglected pieces of clothing in the back of your closet and slip some goodies into their pockets. Make sure you remember the clothes you selected so you don’t accidentally donate them or give them to little siblings. [4] X Research source Get into the habit of double-checking the pockets of anything you plan on donating, just in case you did hide something that you forgot about. Keep the items small and discrete. A folded up dollar bill in a coat pocket won't be noticeable, but a large, bulky candy bar or toy will."

      "title": "Slide flat items between the pages of books.",
      "content": "Slide flat items between the pages of books. This method is great for notes, cash, and cards. It’ll work better if you have lots of books in your room, because most snoopers aren’t going to take the time to flip through each one. [5] X Research source You could make a tiny marking on the chosen book so you’ll remember which one you picked. To stash non-flat items, you could buy a hollow book safe in stores or online, or make your own . It can sit on your shelf just like a real book!"

      "content": "Use an old board game box to stash valuables. If you have a board game you never play anymore, empty out the contents of the box and replace them with your secret items. Then, put the box in the back of your closet. Board game boxes are great for stashing bigger items."

      "content": "Store goodies inside an old stuffed animal. Pick a teddy you’re willing to sacrifice to the cause. Make a little cut along a seam and slip in your items. If the cut is big, you may have to sew it back up so the stuffing doesn’t leak out. [6] X Research source Place it with its fellow stuffed animals so it blends right in."

      "content": "Use a tennis ball for tiny items. Using a pair of scissors, cut a small opening in a tennis ball. Squeeze it to widen the slit, then slide small goodies through the slit and into the tennis ball. Throw the tennis ball into an unassuming location, like the back of your closet, behind your bed, or with your sports stuff. [7] X Research source To retrieve the items, simply squeeze the ball again to widen the slit, and shake the items out. If they are stuck, you may have to use your fingers or tweezers."
