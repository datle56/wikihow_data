      "title": "Spread the word to other union members.",
      "content": "Spread the word to other union members. One person cannot lead a successful strike. Instead, you’ll need all unionized members on board. Begin talking about why you think a strike is necessary. Remember not to talk about striking on your employer’s premises or during work hours. Begin by talking to other workers you trust. Has someone complained about your wages, benefits, hours, or working conditions? This is someone who thinks like you and probably will help plan a strike. Keep your discussions as secretive as possible. If management gets wind of the strike, they’ll try to divide the union membership."

      "content": "Contact your national union. If you’re part of a national union or other overseeing organization, you will need to contact them before you go on strike.

      "title": "Strike for a legitimate purpose.",
      "content": "Strike for a legitimate purpose. Even if you have the right to strike, not all strikes are lawful. For example, you can’t strike to force your company to stop doing business with another company. You also can’t strike to force your employer to do something illegal. You can strike for economic conditions, such as higher pay, better benefits, shorter hours, and better working conditions. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Labor Relations Board Independent U.S. government agency responsible for enforcing U.S. labor law in relation to collective bargaining and unfair labor practices.

      "content": "Pay attention to timing. In the U.S., federal law requires that you provide certain notices to your employer to terminate your collective bargaining agreement. You also need to wait a certain amount of time before you can strike. [5] X Research source If you don’t wait, then the strike will be illegal unless you are protesting unfair labor conditions. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Labor Relations Board Independent U.S. government agency responsible for enforcing U.S. labor law in relation to collective bargaining and unfair labor practices.

      "content": "Identify the consequences of striking. Each country has its own labor laws, so you should understand what can happen to you if you choose to strike. In the U.S., the consequences will depend on whether you are striking for economic reasons or because of unfair labor practices.

However, you are entitled to be recalled to jobs when there is an opening. Unfair labor practice strikers are entitled to reinstatement at the end of the strike. They may also be awarded back pay."

      "content": "Form committees. If you want to go ahead with the strike, you’ll need to form committees. These committees will be in contact with each other, but each will have certain well-defined tasks. Consider forming the following committees: [8] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source General strike committee. This committee oversees everything and keeps detailed records. Negotiating committee. This committee works directly with management to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement.

This committee works directly with the news media and other public officials to spread the word about what you are fighting for. If you have a small workplace, you might combine the picketing and publicity committees. Financial committee. This group will help members support themselves without a paycheck."

Cushion the blow—and maintain union solidarity—by building a strike fund as soon as possible. [9] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source You should set aside a portion of your dues to build up the strike fund.

Write up a list of demands to present to your boss. [13] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source One demand should be that anyone who agrees to strike won’t be penalized later.

      "content": "Negotiate as much as possible before striking. [14] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source Always negotiate in good faith. There’s no reason to strike if you can avoid it, and your employer might be willing to meet some or all of your demands. Your negotiation committee should take the lead. You might not be great at negotiating. A good negotiator should be patient, smart, and focused on details. They shouldn’t be easily ruffled or intimidated. Talk to your national union, who might have negotiators who will come down and help you. Alternately, you might need to hire your own professional negotiator. Talk to your lawyer or contact a nearby law school for help."

      "title": "Communicate with your strikers.",
      "content": "Communicate with your strikers. You can expect management to spread false rumors to create divisions in your ranks. For example, they might lie that the negotiation committee is being completely unreasonable. Keep your strikers in the loop about what is going on by using email and bulletins to communicate.

[15] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source An injunction is a court order to stop doing something, in this case a strike.

[16] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source This person will be responsible for making sure strikers get to the picket line on time.

      "content": "Create vivid signs. Signs should be easy to read from a distance and memorable. Text-based signs with limited colors work best. Remember you are creating a message, not a work of art. Bold black lettering on a white or yellow background stands out. Choose your materials wisely.

[21] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source Your national union might send someone down to give a speech. You can also ask local university faculty to speak about the importance of labor strikes. Let people take breaks to recharge. Maybe a few days off the picket line will reinvigorate them.

Often, they can get a court order blocking the strike on these flimsy grounds. Because of this, document your picket line by having at least one person videotape it.

With luck, you’ll increase your strike’s visibility and put pressure on your employer to give in to your demands. Have your most articulate union members as spokespeople. They should be well-versed in what you are demanding of management."

Counter this perception by emphasizing how the union members are just ordinary hard-working citizens. [23] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source It might be effective for workers to talk about their families and children when explaining why they are striking. For example, you can really humanize a strike by saying something like the following: “Our health care benefits are terrible. My daughter had a heart defect, and our insurance only picked up 10% of the costs of her treatment. I work too hard for such skimpy benefits.”"

Unionized workers generally make more than non-unionized workers, and for this reason some people might not be sympathetic to your demands for more money or benefits. Nevertheless, you can counter by always pointing out how much money your employer has made. For example, you can say, “All we’re asking for is a 4% raise, at a time when the company’s profits grew 25% last year and their stock value increased 30%.”"

Taxpayers will be angry, especially if the company is trying to move their location. For example, you can say, “We’re trying to keep this plant here, in this state. Do you know they received over $40 million from the city and state when they opened 10 years ago? And now they want to move the plant halfway across the world? It’s unbelievable.”"

Instead, emphasize that you love your job and are anxious to get back to it once your employer agrees to your reasonable demands.

Create a website and keep the public updated about the state of negotiations. Include pictures and personal stories from striking employees on the website.

Make sure only one person is in charge of these accounts and approves all content posted. You don’t want any striker to post their thoughts."
