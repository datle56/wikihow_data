      "content": "Go to a custom card maker site for the easiest option. Rather than trying to recreate all the elements of a Pokémon card yourself, search online for “Pokémon card maker” to find a website that lets you design a custom card. The website has a template where you fill out all of the information and add an image, and then it will generate a card that looks like it's straight out of a booster pack. [1] X Research source Pokémon Card Maker lets you create a card that looks like it's from an older 1st Generation series. My Poké Card has options to change the card series, so you can make it look like a classic 1st Generation card or a newer Sun & Moon-style card. If you want to make a GX Pokémon card that has full art on the front, find a card template online and save it to your computer. Use Photoshop or other photo-editing software to create your card."

      "title": "Upload an image for the main card art.",
      "content": "Upload an image for the main card art. If you're making a card for a Pokémon that already exists, look up a picture for your card online or draw them in a brand new pose. If you're creating your own Pokémon , then upload a drawing that you've made of them. Just click the “Upload” button for the image and choose the file you want to use. [2] X Research source If you're making a custom Pokémon card as a gift or a meme, then use any image you want. You might put a picture of a friend on the card and give it to them as a present, or you may make a custom card for a character on another TV show."

      "title": "Fill in the name, HP, evolution, and type information for the card.",
      "content": "Fill in the name, HP, evolution, and type information for the card. Go through all the text boxes on the template to fill in the rest of your card. You can use information that you pulled from another Pokémon card, or you can make up your own for your custom card. Every Pokémon card includes: [3] X Research source Name : the name of your Pokémon. HP : the number of hit points the Pokémon has. Stronger, fully-evolved Pokémon tend to have more HP than weaker ones. Type : the competitive type of your Pokémon. The type also determines the color of the card's background. For example, Fire has a red background and Water has a blue background. Evolution Stage : where the Pokémon is in its evolutionary line. “Basic” Pokémon are like babies and are first in their line. A “Stage 1” Pokémon is like a teen and has only evolved once. A “Stage 2” Pokémon is like an adult and is fully evolved. If you choose Stage 1 or Stage 2 for your custom card, you'll have the option to add a second to show what the evolution before it looked like. Weakness and Resistance : the type of attacks your Pokémon are weak and strong against. Choose a type and a modifier for each. Some Pokémon card makers also let you add flavor text, length, height, and rarity."

      "content": "Create attacks for your Pokémon. Give your Pokémon 1 or 2 attacks that they can use when you play them. Write down attacks that are already on other Pokémon cards, or make up your own for something truly unique. If you want to add any special rules, such as an attack that puts an enemy to sleep, add it to the “Info” section. Set the damage counter for the attack to determine how powerful it is. [4] X Research source Every attack requires Energy. Select the type of Energy cards a player needs to play to do the attack. Normally, attacks that do a lot of damage require a lot of energy and weaker attacks only require one."

Go into the image settings and adjust the dimensions to the proper size. That way, they'll be the same size as official cards that you buy at the store. [6] X Research source If you're making multiple Pokémon cards, then try to fit them all onto the same document so you don't waste as much paper."

Use the highest quality ink that you can so your card looks its best. When the card finishes printing, let the ink dry for a minute or two so it doesn't smudge. [7] X Research source To make a holographic Pokémon card, then print on transparency paper instead. You can usually put transparency paper in your printer at home, but just double-check your printer settings first. If you don't have a printer at home, check at a local library or print shop to see if they'll print them for you."

Try to get as close to the edge of the card design as you can. Once you have the card cut out, carefully round the corners of the card so they aren't sharp. [8] X Research source Use a corner rounder to quickly cut off the sharp points."

Stick your custom card on with double-sided tape if you want a temporary option. Otherwise, apply a spray adhesive to the back of your custom card and press it onto the old card. [9] X Research source If you don't have any old Pokémon cards, then find a picture of the card back online and print it out. If you want to make a custom holographic card, remove the paint from an old holographic Pokémon card you don't want anymore. Wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol and rub it on the card until the ink comes off. Glue the transparent custom card you printed to the foil backing. [10] X Research source"

Slowly cut off the small bits of excess paper so they're fish with the edge of the card back. [11] X Research source For a more precise cut, hold a straightedge so it lines up with the edge of the card. Run your craft knife along the straightedge to remove any excess. Keep your cards in sleeves for an added layer of protection. [12] X Research source Avoid selling any fake cards that you make since Pokémon is a copyrighted brand and it's illegal to make money off of counterfeits."
