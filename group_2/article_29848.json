      "content": "Cut a 10 by 20 in (25 by 51 cm) rectangle out of fabric. Choose a durable fabric, such as cotton, linen, canvas, or jersey. Use a tailor's chalk or pen and a ruler to draw a 10 by 20 in (25 by 51 cm) rectangle on the back of the fabric. Cut the fabric out with fabric scissors. The fabric can be solid colored or it can have a print on it. This pattern already includes seam allowances, so you don't need to add more. You can make a bigger/smaller bag if you want to, but keep the proportions the same. Make it twice as long as it is wide. You can also cut 2 matching squares of fabric if you'd like—like if you want the front and back of the bag to be different colors.

      "content": "Fold 1 of the long edges down by 4 inches (10 cm) and iron it. Turn your fabric so that the back (wrong side) is facing you. Fold 1 of the 20 in (51 cm) edges down by 4 inches (10 cm). Secure it with sewing pins, then press it flat with an iron. This will make the top of your bag. Use a heat setting on your iron that is safe for your fabric. For example, if you are making a linen bag, use the linen setting on your iron."

      "title": "Sew 2 lines across the folded edge to create a drawstring channel.",
      "content": "Sew 2 lines across the folded edge to create a drawstring channel. The first line needs to be 2 1 ⁄ 2 inches (6.4 cm) down from the top of the folded. The second line needs to be 3 1 ⁄ 2 inches (8.9 cm) from the fold. When you are done, you will have a 1 inch (2.5 cm) space between the 2 lines; this space will make the channel for the ribbon to go through. You can match the thread color to the fabric, or you can use a contrasting color. For example, if you are making a white bag, try red thread for a simple design. Use a straight stitch for this. If you are working with stretchy fabric, use a zigzag stitch instead. Be sure to backstitch so that the stitching doesn't come undone. This is where you reverse the sewing machine for 2 to 3 stitches. Be sure not to sew the sides or you won't be able to insert the drawstring.

Bring the narrow edges together to fold the fabric in half. Insert sewing pins along the bottom and side edge of the rectangle. Do not insert any sewing pins along the top or side folded edges. It does not matter how many sewing pins you use, or how close together they are. As long as they hold the fabric in place, you are good."

When sewing the side, skip the 1 in (2.5 cm) gap between the 2 horizontal lines you sewed earlier, or you won't be able to insert the drawstring. When you are done, remove the sewing pins. Use a straight stitch for woven fabric, and a zigzag stitch for stretchy fabric. Remember to backstitch when you start and finish sewing. You are only sewing where the pins are.

Match the color to your bag, or use a contrasting color. For example, if you have a blue canvas bag, a thin, white rope would look nice. If your ribbon or string is made from polyester, singe the cut ends with a flame to prevent unraveling. If your ribbon or string is not made from polyester, seal the cut ends with fabric glue or fray-check. Let the ends dry before moving on."

By folding the shirt in half, you can ensure that both long handles will come out symmetrical. Try to use a good pair of fabric scissors for this. Regular scissors will still work, but they don't give you as clean of a cut."

Also, try to leave 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of space between the neckline and the sleeves. This will make your handles more durable.

If you are keeping the tassels on the inside of your bag, you should trim them down as well so that they don't get tangled. If you want to keep the tassels long, consider adding some pony beads onto them. Tie knots under the beads, if needed, to keep them in place."
