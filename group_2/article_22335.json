      "title": "Try blinking.",
      "content": "Try blinking. Sometimes scratches to the cornea are caused by small objects that get trapped beneath the eyelid, such as dust, dirt, sand or even an eyelash. Before you can start to treat the scratch, you must remove this foreign object. Try blinking several times in a row to remove the object. Closing and opening your eye can stimulate the lacrimal glands to produce more tears and wash the foreign body out of the eye. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Optometric Association Professional medical organization dedicated to supporting optometrists and improving public eye and vision health Go to source With your right hand, pull the upper eyelid over the lower eyelid of the affected eye. The lashes of the lower eyelid may brush the foreign object out of the eye. Do not try to remove any trapped items with your fingers, tweezers, or any other object as this can make the eye injury worse."

      "title": "Rinse out your eye.",
      "content": "Rinse out your eye. If blinking didn't get the foreign object out of your eye, try rinsing your eye with water or saline solution. It's best to use a sterile or saline solution. Do not use tap water. Ideal properties for eyewash solution include a neutral pH of 7.0 and a temperature between 60°F and 100°F (15.5 to 37.8°C). Though this is anecdotally often suggested, do NOT administer the solution to your eye using a cup. If there is a foreign object in the eye, using a cup to pour water on it can cause the object to become further lodged in the eye. Follow these guidelines as to how long you should rinse your eye out: [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source For mildly irritating chemicals, rinse for five minutes. For moderate-to-severe irritants, rinse for at least 20 minutes. For non-penetrating corrosives such as acids, rinse for 20 minutes. For penetrating corrosives such as alkalis, rinse for at least 60 minutes. Be sure to note any additional symptoms that may indicate that a poisonous solution has gotten into the eye, including: nausea or vomiting, headaches or lightheadedness, double vision or impaired vision, dizziness or loss of consciousness, rashes or fever. If you notice these symptoms, call poison control (800) 222-1222 and seek medical attention immediately."

      "title": "Use eye drops.",
      "content": "Use eye drops. Another method of removing any trapped objects is to place some lubricating eye drops in the injured eye to flush it out. Lubricating eye drops can be purchased over-the-counter at the drugstore. You can put the eye drops in yourself or get someone else to help you. The correct method for using eye drops is described in Part 3 below. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Artificial tear drops are designed to lubricate eyes and keep them moist on the outer surface. They are available over the counter and are available in a wide assortment of brands. Some artificial tears contain preservatives to help keep the solution on the surface of your eyes for a longer period of time. However, these preservatives can irritate your eyes if you use them more than four times per day. If you need to use artificial tears more than four times per day, look for preservative-free artificial tears. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose are the two most common lubricants in tear drops and can be found in many over-the-counter-solutions. Trial and error is usually the only way to find the best brand of artificial tears for your particular eyes. In some cases, a combination of a few brands may be even be necessary. In the case of chronic dry eyes, artificial tears must be used even if the eyes are symptom-free. Artificial tears can only provide supplemental care and are not a substitute for natural tears."

      "content": "See your doctor if the scratch worsens and doesn't heal. Once the foreign object has been removed, a lightly scratched cornea should heal on its own in a number of days. However, serious scratches or those that have become infected will require antibacterial eye drops in order to heal properly. See your doctor if any of the following occurs: [7] X Research source You suspect that the foreign object is still in your eye. You experience any combination of the following symptoms: blurry vision, redness, substantial pain, tearing, extreme light sensitivity. You think you have a corneal ulceration (open wound on your cornea), which is usually caused by an infection in the eye. You have green, yellow or bloody pus coming out of your eye. You notice light flashes or you visualize tiny dark objects or shadows floating around. You have a fever."

[8] X Research source The doctor will use a penlight or ophthalmoscope to examine your eye for trauma. Your doctor may also examine your injured eye using special eye drops with Fluorescein dye that make your tears yellow. This dye helps make your abrasion more visible under the blue light. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source To do this, a topical anesthetic is added to the eye and then your lower lid will be pulled down gently. A Fluorescein strip is then touched onto the eye, and as you blink, the dye spreads throughout the eye. Yellow stained areas under normal light indicated damaged corneal areas. Your doctor will then use a special cobalt blue light to highlight areas of abrasion and to determine the cause. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Several vertical abrasions can indicate a foreign body, while branching stains can indicate herpes keratitis. Additionally, several punctuated lesions can indicate your contact lens as a cause.

      "content": "Avoid wearing an eye patch. Eye patches were traditionally used to help heal a corneal scratch, however recent medical studies have found that eye patches can actually increase pain and prolong healing. An eye patch hinders the natural blinking of the eye, thus straining the eyelids and producing pain. It also increases the tearing of the eye and this invites more infection and delays the healing process. An eye patch also decreases oxygen delivery, and the cornea is dependent on oxygenation.

      "content": "Inquire about alternatives to eye patches. Nowadays, instead of an eye patch, your doctor will often prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) eye drops, used in combination with a soft, disposable contact lens. The eye drops are designed to decrease the sensitivity of your cornea. The soft contact lens is used as a bandage to protect your eye, speed up the healing process and reduce pain while it heals. Unlike with eye patches, this therapy allows you to see out of both of your eyes, all the while reducing inflammation. The most common prescribed eye drops and ointments include topical NSAIDs [16] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source and antibiotics. [17] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Topical NSAIDs : Try Diclofenac (Voltaren), 0.1% solution.
