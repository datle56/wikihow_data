[2] X Research source Stir just enough to help the coffee grounds circulate, then cover the pot with a lid. Use medium to medium-fine coffee grounds of your choice. [3] X Research source Alternatively, add 1 to 2 tsp (1.8 to 3.6 g) of instant coffee to the water. Some people prefer to bring the mixture back up to a boil for up to 2 minutes to increase the bitterness of the brew. Optionally, mix your grounds with clean crushed eggshells before boiling to neutralize and temper any sharp or overly bitter flavors. [4] X Research source"

Once almost all the grounds settle at the bottom of the pot, your brew is done!

If you have a tea strainer or a coffee filter, place it over your mug to help keep the grounds out. Or, ladle the coffee into a mug. Serve your brew with add-ins of your choice, like a creamer, milk, sugar, or sugar substitute. [6] X Research source If your coffee tastes too bitter, strain it out earlier than 4 minutes next time. If your coffee is too mild, let it brew for a few more minutes. [7] X Research source"

Remove the metal center lid from the band and screw the band over the filter and onto the jar. [8] X Research source This will create a basket for your coffee grounds. Just like a coffee machine, the hot water will pass through the grounds and brew fresh coffee into the jar. Alternatively, use a reusable cloth coffee filter ."

[17] X Research source If you’re using a saucepan, choose the smallest size you have. Make sure the ibrik has room in the neck so the coffee can froth.

[22] X Research source Try to avoid stirring after pouring the coffee into a cup—this may cause the foam to collapse. Leave the last bit of coffee in the ibrik to trap some of the “sludge.” When drinking, leave the last bit in your cup.

A moka pot has three chambers: the bottom chamber is for water, the middle basket is for your ground coffee, and the top part is where the coffee flows when it’s brewed. Alternatively, boil the water in a pot on the stove and then add it to the moka pot to prevent the metal moka pot from overheating and giving your coffee a metallic taste."
