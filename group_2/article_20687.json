If you watched a television program with your loved one, try to find a new friend to watch the program with you. If a particular street corner is a painful reminder of your loved one, find a different walking route. Remember that you can return to your old activities once your grief has subsided.

[14] X Research source If you learn about these stages of grief, you will be prepared for the strong emotions they evoke. Knowing the stages of grief in advance will not eliminate your pain, but it might make you more equipped to face the pain. Note that you might not go through these stages in the typical order. Sometimes grieving people repeat steps, remain in one step for a long time, experience multiple steps all at once, or go through the stages in a completely different order. Sometimes the bereaved are able to move on very quickly with their lives without going through the steps at all. [15] X Research source Remember that each individual grieves differently.

This is not a sign that you don't care: indeed, this is a sign that you care very much. Denial can help you get through the early days of your grief by allowing you to plan a funeral, contact other bereaved people, or handle financial matters. [17] X Research source Often the memorial service or funeral can help make the death seem real. [18] X Research source If you have been preparing for your loved one's death for a long time, you might not experience denial or disbelief. For example, if your loved one experienced a lengthy terminal illness, you might have processed your disbelief before their death.

Sometimes people feel guilty about being able to reestablish a normal life after the death of a loved one and believe that moving on is somehow a betrayal.

However, grief can also reappear at sudden moments for many years after the loss: at holidays, anniversaries, or even during a particularly sad day. [22] X Research source Keep in mind that you cannot get through grief on a schedule. Different people will progress differently through grief, and you might continue to grieve throughout your life. Breniman suggests trying a meditation practice, which \"can help you keep your mind still in times of need.\" While some grief and sadness is normal for many years after a loss, these feelings of sadness should not keep you from leading a normal life. If you are unable to function because of your grief--even years after a loss--you might want to consider grief counseling or therapy. These sad feelings might always be a part of your life, but they should not be the dominant force in your life."

LCSW Ken Breniman agrees that it can be helpful \"to locally seek a support group.\" Many of the stages of grief encourage you to feel isolated and alone. While much of your grieving process will be solitary, you will likely find solace in the company of other mourners who miss your loved one just like you. Share your own painful emotions with your support network as well as happy memories of your loved one who is gone. They will be able to understand your pain in a way that nobody else will. Share this pain together so that you can all begin to move on. Breniman suggests looking at your \"local church, hospital, or hospice, which often have free resources for grief.\""

If you are feeling isolated, if you live far away from friends and family, or if you are finding it difficult to function, you will likely need professional support.
