      "title": "Measure your chicken’s neckline and waistline.",
      "content": "Measure your chicken’s neckline and waistline. Use your measuring tape and wrap it carefully around your chicken’s neckline and waistline. These two measurements correspond to the wraparound arms of the harness, which will create an H-shape once you create the pattern. The middle line of the H will run along the chicken’s back, just like other standard pet harnesses. Make sure not to tighten the measuring tape too much or too little. You should have about two-fingers’ worth of space between your chicken and the tape. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw and cut out the pattern on scrap fabric before cutting your harness fabric. Using your measurements, draw the H-shaped pattern on scrap fabric. Remember, the arms of the H needs to wrap around your chicken’s neckline and waistline comfortably. Make sure the arms of the H are wide enough to allow for the Velcro clasps to overlap and stick together. [2] X Research source Most standard sewing Velcro is 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) wide. To secure the Velcro to the harness piece, make sure your harness is at least 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) wider than the Velcro on both sides. The length of the harness arms is determined by the neckline and waistline measurements, so your Velcro pieces should be as long as necessary to close the harness securely around your chicken."

      "title": "Fit the scrap fabric on your chicken.",
      "content": "Fit the scrap fabric on your chicken. As the old saying goes, “measure twice, cut once.” Place the middle line of the H-shaped fabric along the back of the chicken, and then wrap the arms around its neckline and waistline. Make sure the fabric wraps around your chicken comfortably. If your pattern is too loose, trim the edges and re-test on your chicken. If your pattern is too tight, re-draw the pattern on more scrap fabric and re-test."

      "title": "Draw and cut out the pattern on your harness fabric.",
      "content": "Draw and cut out the pattern on your harness fabric. Draw your pattern on your harness fabric and use fabric shears (or heavy-duty scissors) to cut out your pattern. You will only need one H-shaped piece for canvas fabric. Most pet harnesses are made of a fabric like canvas, as canvas is stretchy but sturdy, breathable, and lightweight. [3] X Research source Don’t forget to cut your Velcro pieces to the appropriate size now that your harness is cut to the correct shape you want."

      "title": "Draw and cut out a piece of strapping from the canvas fabric for the D-ring.",
      "content": "Draw and cut out a piece of strapping from the canvas fabric for the D-ring. The strapping piece attaches to the back of the harness. This is where you attach the D-ring, a strong, lightweight piece of metal that your chicken’s leash will clip onto. The strapping piece should be about 1-inch wide and shorter than the H-shaped harness piece."

    {
      "title": "Sew the strapping piece to the back of the harness.",
      "content": "Sew the strapping piece to the back of the harness. Pin the strapping piece to the back of the H-shaped piece with a pin needle. To secure heavy fabric together, use a strong, secure stitch that’s hard to rip apart, like a zig-zag stitch. Only sew the top of the strapping to the harness! You will need to slip the D-ring on to the strapping before you sew the bottom to the harness. Sew the bottom of the strapping onto the harness after sliding the D-ring onto the strapping. Remember, the D-ring is for your chicken’s leash."

      "content": "Sew the Velcro pieces onto the arms of the harness. You can use a simple standard stitch for the Velcro, but go over the edges twice, to secure the Velcro to the harness. The sturdier the stitch, the more secure the Velcro will be."

      "content": "Calm your chicken before putting on the harness. Like any animal getting fitted into a new harness, your chicken might be fussy. Some chickens like to be pet to calm down, like dogs, so try petting it first. If you can’t seem to get the harness on the chicken, wait a few hours and try again."

      "content": "Slide the harness on carefully. Both of you are new to the harness, so take your time. This is a great time to double-check that the harness fits correctly! Make sure the Velcro closes together completely and tug gently on the strapping piece."
