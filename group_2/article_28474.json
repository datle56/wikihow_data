      "content": "Find or purchase a notebook that suits your needs. Think carefully about the size, bindings, and paper pattern that you want. If you like to include a lot of details, you’ll probably need a larger notebook. But something smaller will be easier to carry, and it will take up less room in your backpack. You’ll also have a choice of bindings. Spiral-bound notebooks lie flat, but composition books and similar notebooks with a sewn binding won’t damage your other books and papers, as spiral bindings sometimes do. [1] X Research source If you like to keep all of your papers together, consider purchasing a notebook that has a folder attached or a pocket inside the front cover. If you choose to draw a biweekly calendar rather than listing your assignments, you may find that blank, grid-lined, or grid-dotted paper is a good choice. Blank paper will also allow you to make your own pages however you like—simply draw what you want into your planner. This choice is especially handy if you’re good at art and want to add a lot of aesthetics and decoration to your planner."

      "content": "Write or staple a copy of your class schedule on the first page. Especially at the beginning of your school year or semester, you may not have your class schedule memorized. By pasting your schedule into the very front of your planner, you’ll always have it available for easy reference."

      "title": "Add monthly calendars pages to your planner.",
      "content": "Add monthly calendars pages to your planner. Open your planner to a blank page and draw a table with four rows and six columns. Make sure that each square is large enough to record assignments and events—if you need to make your calendar stretch across two pages, that’s okay, too. [2] X Research source Label the top of each column with a day of the week, combining Saturday and Sunday into one column. Then, write the corresponding date into the corner of each small box. Write the name of the month and year at the top of the page, e.g., January 2025. You only need to create monthly pages for the months you’ll be using your planner in. If you don’t plan on using your planner during the summer, for example, you can skip making pages for July and August. You can use this website to view the calendar for any given year and month and make sure you’re filling in the dates and days of the week correctly."

      "title": "Add weekly pages to add more detail about your daily schedule.",
      "content": "Add weekly pages to add more detail about your daily schedule. Open your planner up so that two blank pages are in front of you. Draw two evenly-spaced vertical lines down each page. Using the seam of the notebook as an additional line, you should be left with six vertical columns. Draw a horizontal line across the top of the columns, leaving about 0.5–1 in (13–25 mm) of space between the line and the top of the page. [3] X Research source In the boxes created by this horizontal line, write the corresponding date and day of the week for your desired date range in each box. For example, one set of pages may have Monday March 3, Tuesday March 4, Wednesday March 5, etc. In your last column, combine Saturday and Sunday into one, since you generally won’t have homework or assignments due on those days. If you’d prefer, make horizontal rows instead of vertical columns. Or, lay it out in a different way that makes sense to you. A planner that you don't like using won't help you organize your homework and get assignments done. So, feel free to adjust and personalize your planner to your exact needs—but use these steps as a guideline."

Add any stickers you like, as well as planner stickers that have dates, times, and activities on them. [5] X Research source Use colored pencils or markers to doodle or color in sections of your pages and use patterned tape to create borders or make cool designs. If you need inspiration, search “aesthetic diy planner” in a search engine or social media platform to see tons of fun and creative planner ideas."

      "title": "Add a design to the front cover of your planner.",
      "content": "Add a design to the front cover of your planner. If the cover of your planner is currently blank or not to your liking, decorate it with anything you like—stickers, doodles, magazine collages, etc. Base your design on something you’re interested in, like drawing a comic strip or your favorite superhero on the cover if you’re into comics. Or, make a collage of your favorite singer, dream destination, or aesthetic images you like. You can use paints, markers, glue, colored pencils, and other craft supplies to decorate the outside of your planner. However, make sure that whatever you use will be durable. For example, if you glue sequins to the cover or use glitter, you risk losing your decorations in the deep, dark depths of your backpack. Decorating the outside is one of the best ways to make your planner just for you. And the more you feel like your planner expresses your personality and creativity, the more you’ll want to use it. Plus, you’ll get to show off your beautiful work."

      "content": "Use monthly calendars to plan for long-term projects and exams. When you get your syllabus at the beginning of the year or semester, write any major projects, exams, or deadlines into your monthly calendar. Then, break up these deadlines into short-term goals to make sure that you’re beginning to work on your major projects or study for important exams in advance. [6] X Research source For example, let’s say you have a science exam on Friday, October 28th. On each of the 3-4 previous Fridays, write “study a chapter for science exam” onto your monthly calendar. This way, you’ll be studying for your exam throughout the month, rather than cramming at the last minute. Similarly, you may have a paper due on Friday, October 28th. Break up the paper into steps, like an outline, rough draft, revisions, and final draft. Assign yourself an earlier deadline for each of these stages and note them in your monthly calendar. When you get your school’s official calendar at the beginning of the year, copy its important dates into your planner’s monthly calendar, e.g., school breaks, standardized testing weeks, extracurricular events, etc. If you so choose, add personal events like birthdays, appointments, holidays, and other significant occasions to your monthly calendar."

Then, in a different color pen, write a to-do list for each day that will ensure you get all of your assignments turned in on time. [7] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source For example, let’s say you have English and Spanish homework due Wednesday, a math exam on Thursday, and chemistry and history assignments due on Friday. Your daily to-do lists might look like: Monday (do English homework); Tuesday (do Spanish homework); Wednesday (study for math exam); Thursday (chemistry and history homework). Stay organized by using different colored markers or pens to color code your courses or assignment types. You can assign different colors to different classes, different types of work (essay, project, test review), or different priority levels (due next week, urgent, etc.). If your teacher tends to change due dates often, write your planner entries in pencil."

For example, you can make a page of goals for the next few weeks or the semester, a page for the school calendar, or a page with contact information and birthdays. When you do add new sections, use sticky tabs or flags to label the sections so that you can easily find what you need in your planner. [8] X Research source"
