Place 4 cups of sugar, 1 cup of corn syrup, 1 cup of water, and 1/4 tsp. of salt into the saucepan and stir the ingredients together until the sugar is melted.

Hold it about one foot (30 cm) above the parchment and swing it back and forth so that very thin strands of sugar begin to fall on the paper. Keep going a few more times until you've got a nice looking nest of spun sugar. Know that it won't look like the machine cotton candy you're used to."
