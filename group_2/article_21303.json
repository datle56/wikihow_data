      "content": "Add seeds. Sprinkle a pinch of seeds down the middle of the moist paper towels. Add a generous number of seeds, but don’t overdo it! You should be able to see plenty of white space between the seeds and the paper towels. Fold the paper towels in half down the middle with the seeds inside."

      "title": "Chill seeds.",
      "content": "Chill seeds. Place the folded paper towels into the Ziploc bag. If you need to fold the paper towels additional times to make them fit, that is fine. Seal the bag and place it in a refrigerator. The refrigerator replicates winter temperatures and prepares the seeds for “spring” and germination."

      "title": "Transfer seeds to a warm, sunny spot.",
      "content": "Transfer seeds to a warm, sunny spot. After three or four days, remove the Ziploc from the refrigerator and place it in a warm spot like a sunny windowsill or porch. The heat and light should create condensation that triggers germination. [4] X Research source Leave the Ziploc bag slightly open once you remove it from the refrigerator. This allows air circulation and reduces the odds that the seeds will become moldy. The goal is to encourage a warm, slightly moist environment inside the bag."

      "content": "Wait for seeds to become seedlings. After about a week, check on the seeds. Continue checking on the seeds until you discover they’ve become seedlings. If you see them turning white, you'll know you're making progress! The warmer the environment, the more quickly seeds will sprout. When seedlings reach about half an inch long, it’s time to plant them!"

      "content": "Plant seedlings in small pots. You can plant multiple seedlings in one pot (the exact number will depend on the size of your pots.) Make sure to leave plenty of space between the seedlings so you’ll be able to dig them up and transfer them later. Even if you plan to plant your henna seedlings in the ground eventually, start them in pots. You can safely transfer plants into the ground, if desired, after about 5 months. Keeping immature seedlings in a pot allows you to safeguard them from the elements. You'll be able to bring the pots inside as needed until they’re strong enough to withstand strong wind, rain, etc."

      "content": "Plan to grow your henna as a houseplant if you live in a cooler climate. Henna plants won’t survive outdoors if temperatures drop below 50ºF (11ºC). When your henna plant is inside, keep it in a sunny, warm spot such as a windowsill. Even if your plant is a potted houseplant, you can leave it outside in the sun in warm temperatures. To protect your plant against an unexpected early-season cold front, bring it indoors in early fall. Keep your plant indoors until spring, after the threat of cold fronts has subsided."
