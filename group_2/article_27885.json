For example, you could write the following: “My short-term goal is to take more initiative at work. My mid-term goal is to get a master’s degree and apply this to my job or another job. My long-term goal is to manage my own team at work.” Update your goals as necessary. Every few months, reevaluate them as a benchmark and to ensure they’re still attainable."
