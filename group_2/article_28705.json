They aren't that much money and it will make the work a lot easier, if you need to make several hundred buttons. You can also buy a hand-held cheap version but this produces a cheap-looking button. You can also get paper cutters which will further streamline the process. Just make sure it's the right size for your machine."

Whatever buttons you choose, ensure that they are in excellent condition and will be able to withstand being turned into an often-worn item of jewelry. Older, more fragile buttons may not be ideal for this project."
