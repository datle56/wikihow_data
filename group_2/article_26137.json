      "title": "Keep a blanket with you.",
      "content": "Keep a blanket with you. Lack of sleep is a major issue for individuals living on the streets because you let down your guard when you fall asleep. Always carry your blanket so that you can take advantage of a good sleeping opportunity. [1] X Research source Sleeping bags are warm and suitable for outdoors. Try a bivy sack, which is like a body-sized tent. It is collapsible and will protect you from the elements. If you live in a very cold area, sleeping on the ground is risky even if you have a sleeping bag and warm clothes because the ground will absorb your body heat. You will need an inflatable insulated sleeping pad to keep in your heat."

      "title": "Sleep in groups.",
      "content": "Sleep in groups. If you are able to make friends with other individuals who are living on the street, arrange to sleep in a group so that you can designate lookouts. Your group doesn’t have to be large to be effective. Even one trusted individual can make sleeping safer. [2] X Research source Get to know someone before you trust them with your safety. Remember that you are all trying to survive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a shelter.",
      "content": "Try a shelter. Shelters offer a roof and usually showers, but they can be difficult to get into. Most cities have one, and many cities with a high concentration of homeless people have multiple shelters. Google Maps can help you locate the shelters in your area. Be aware of your surroundings when you sleep in a shelter. You don’t have any privacy there, your belongings are not necessarily safe, and other people in the shelter may pose a threat. [3] X Research source Shelters are commonly non-profit, but some are for-profit. You may be charged a fee for using the shelter, so discuss your options before taking a bed."

    {
      "title": "Sleep during the day.",
      "content": "Sleep during the day. You are most at-risk while you are sleeping, but sleeping during the day will help you stay safer. While it may be difficult to get used to sleeping while it’s light out, you are less likely to be a victim of crime or to be arrested during the daytime. Try a public park. You can spread out your blanket as though you are on a picnic. Take a beach nap. If you are near a beach, consider sleeping there during the day. You can fold your blanket like a beach towel so that you blend in with other sunbathers. Be careful to use your sunscreen and avoid the hottest parts of the day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose public places.",
      "content": "Choose public places. This is especially important if you choose to sleep at night. While you may dislike having people see you sleep, stay safe by choosing well-lit, high traffic locations where you are less likely to be a victim."
    },
    {
      "title": "Visit soup kitchens.",
      "content": "Visit soup kitchens. Find a hot meal and possibly other services at soup kitchens, which are commonly run by churches and charities. Soup kitchens also offer networking and outreach opportunities. You can get to know other people who are living on the streets, and may find someone who can help you better your circumstances. [4] X Research source If you can’t find a soup kitchen, try religious facilities, which usually offer some type of charitable support. You may be able to get a few grocery items or a store gift-card. Ask the soup kitchen staff for information about related services, programs that help the homeless, and opportunities for assistance in getting off the streets, but don’t ask them to give you money or let you stay with them."

    {
      "title": "Ask for food",
      "content": "Ask for food . While you want to avoid walking up to people and soliciting them for help, panhandling for food can keep you fed while you live on the streets. People are often more willing to donate food than to give money."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get free samples.",
      "content": "Get free samples. If you are able to blend in with other customers, go into grocery stores and collect the free samples. Don’t take multiple samples from the same booth unless the person working the table gives you permission. Keep track of which store offers the most samples so that you can return there. Be sure to act like a customer. It’s a good idea to make a small purchase, even if it’s just a single piece of fruit or a pack of noodles. Visit farmer's markets after closing to see if you can get leftover produce for free or very cheap."

    {
      "title": "Dumpster dive",
      "content": "Dumpster dive . Stores and restaurants throw out food every day, and some of that food could be going into your stomach. Dumpster diving has become common because even people who can afford food choose to do it. Check the area around the dumpster so that you can avoid confrontations with people who may not want you to remove items from that dumpster, such as a business owner or someone who already dives there. When in doubt, don’t eat food that might have gone bad. Most chain grocery stores throw out extra food even before the best by date. Look in bins behind stores such as Walmart, Kroger, or Safeway. Find out if dumpster diving is legal in your area and don't go into bins that are in gates."

    {
      "title": "Prioritize proteins.",
      "content": "Prioritize proteins. Your diet will likely suffer when you’re living on the streets, but you can keep yourself in better health by making sure you get enough protein. While you might not be able to get meat, low cost options exist. For example, try peanut butter for cheap protein that doesn’t need refrigeration. Beans are another great option, though you may need to warm them. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep lightweight snacks.",
      "content": "Keep lightweight snacks. Supplement your soup kitchen meals, samples, dumpster scores, and donations by keeping a snack stash. Depending on how much money you can find or earn, purchase or collect low-cost, non-perishable food that you can carry in your bag. Try nuts, trail mixes, and nut butters, which contain protein and fats. You can also try dried foods like raisins, beef jerky, and granola bars that are light and often nutritious, though they cost more. Remove packaging from food to make it less bulky and reduce weight. Look for snacks while you’re dumpster diving. They may be past their sell-by date, but they are usually still good for awhile. Collect free condiments that you can use in a pinch when other food is unavailable."

    {
      "title": "Carry a water bottle.",
      "content": "Carry a water bottle. Water is more essential than food, so keep a water bottle with you at all times. Fill up your water bottle every time you see a water fountain or clean sink, even if it isn’t empty. While water is easily found in the city, you don’t want to risk being caught with an empty bottle because dehydration is one of your biggest risks. If you aren’t in a city, then look for flowing water or catch rain water."

      "title": "Wash yourself in bathrooms.",
      "content": "Wash yourself in bathrooms. Public bathrooms are essential when you’re living on the street. Aside from being a place to relieve yourself, they offer you free running water, soap, and privacy. While it’s best to carry your own toiletries, if you can’t afford to buy soap or shampoo you can use the bathroom’s hand soap. [6] X Research source Look for available public bathrooms in places like fast food restaurants, shopping centers, airports, libraries, colleges, and office buildings. Try turning a stall into a private wash station by bringing a container of water and mirror into the stall. If you are able to purchase one, you can acquire a collapsible bucket from an outdoor store. This is a great option if you cannot find a private bathroom."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a shower.",
      "content": "Find a shower. While most of your bathing will likely consist of bathroom sponge-baths, there are options for showering. You can try shelters, but you may be able to find a public shower that you can gain access to. Try visiting gyms or the YMCA. While you may have to pay gym fees, you can ask if the gym offers free trials. You may be able to take advantage of one of these options, giving you access to the gym’s facilities. Use the showers at a beach or campground. While these showers may sometimes lack privacy, they make washing yourself easier than it is in a sink. Act as though you belong, and it’s unlikely anyone will question you."

    {
      "title": "Wash your clothes.",
      "content": "Wash your clothes. It’s easier to clean yourself than it is to clean your clothes, but keeping your clothes smelling good will keep more opportunities open to you because people are less likely to suspect that you are living on the streets. While going to the laundromat weekly is best, if that is impossible then you can wash your clothes in the sink. Check with your local shelter or soup kitchen to find out if they offer facilities for washing clothes. Collect change to use in the laundromat. Coin-operated washers and dryers often cost between $1-1.25. Wash your clothes in a bathroom sink a few pieces at a time then hang-dry them."

      "title": "Try baking soda.",
      "content": "Try baking soda. Baking soda is cheap and can be used to keep both yourself and your clothes smelling better. Use it to wash your clothes and to deodorize your armpits and groin area. You can even use baking soda as natural deodorant."

      "title": "Use the library.",
      "content": "Use the library. Public and university libraries are excellent resources for people living on the street. You can use the computers, access the internet, apply for jobs, read a book or magazine, gain shelter, and take advantage of the bathroom. If you are interested in finding a steady job and housing, the library can help you attain that. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Travel light. You don’t want to alert people to the fact that you are living on the streets because they will make assumptions about you and are likely to want you to stay away from them. This is especially important for if you are accessing stores, office buildings, and other facilities. Look for somewhere safe to stash extra items, or reduce your possessions so that they easily fit into a backpack and tote. [8] X Research source When carrying a backpack, try to look like you’re either a hiking-enthusiast or a bicyclist who carries a backpack for convenience. Try to use a bag that looks like a standard tote or reusable grocery bag so that people will assume that you are on your way home from shopping."

      "content": "Get a post office box. While you will have to pay for it, a post office box can be instrumental in helping you maintain a lifestyle or get back on your feet if that’s your desire. You can have mail sent to your post office box, store small items in your box, and use it as an address on job applications. You may not be able to use it as an address to get services, but some post office box options will provide you with a usable address, so ask about your options. https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/ten-things-you-need-know-live-streets/ </ref>"

      "content": "Be alert. Your safety depends on you being aware of your surroundings. Living on the streets can be dangerous, especially since you can’t always tell who to trust. In addition to some people posing a threat to your safety, people may assume that you are the threat. Be cautious and courteous."

      "title": "Stay with a group.",
      "content": "Stay with a group. As the cliche says, there is safety in numbers. Try to form partnerships with other people living on the streets so that you can keep each other safe. Living as a group will also allow you the option of keeping more possessions because you can take turns watching each other’s stuff. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn police patterns.",
      "content": "Learn police patterns. While the police usually mean security, for a person living on the streets they can also be a threat. Because of prejudices against people on the streets, you may be viewed as a criminal, especially in certain neighborhoods. Know where they tend to patrol and use that information to make the best decisions about where to sleep and where to seek shelter. [10] X Research source Depending on your area and race, a police presence could make a place safer or less safe for sleeping. If you have a good relationship with the police in your area, then sleeping on their patrols could be a good option for you. Always be respectful when interacting with the police, even if you feel you are being treated unfairly."

      "title": "Know your rights.",
      "content": "Know your rights. When you live on the streets, you have to know the law well enough to protect yourself. No matter what anyone says, you still have rights. For example, in the U.S. you can legally hold up a sign asking for money in a public location because that falls under the First Amendment. On the flip side, some cities do have laws and ordinances that address the homeless population, so you need to check with local nonprofits to get that information. [11] X Research source You can find pamphlets and more information at organizations such as the ACLU and nonprofits that focus on helping those who live on the streets. [12] X Research source If you don’t know where to start, ask for help at your local soup kitchen or use the resources at the public library to do research."

      "content": "Seek shelter during a storm. During harsh weather, don’t follow your normal sleeping patterns. Storms present an emergency situation when you’re living on the streets. Try places like transit terminals where you can blend in with stranded riders, or walk the aisles of an open shop if it’s during the day. You can also look for 24-hr waiting areas at airports or hospitals. If you do have a local airport, blend in with fellow travelers, which should allow you to take a nap in the waiting area. Be sure to move around, though, so that no one becomes suspicious."

      "content": "Protect your belongings. Living on the streets means that you’ll have to either reduce your belongings to what you can carry or establish a home base. If you work with a partner or group, then you can take turns guarding each other’s possessions. Find out if a local shelter allows for people to store items there. Carry a large stick or umbrella to ward off possible thieves. Cover your belongings when you sleep, and if possible wrap part of the bag around your leg or arm so that if someone tries to steal it they’ll risk waking you."
