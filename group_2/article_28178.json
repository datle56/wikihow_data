      "content": "Time blocking your day helps it feel shorter. Think about what you usually accomplish in a given day. Chunk each major task into a time block; once you finish the first block, move on to the next one. [1] X Research source This type of schedule helps you concentrate, and makes you focus less on how much time is still left in your boring activity. At work, you might spend 9 to 9:30 AM replying to emails, 9:30 to 11:00 AM working on a personal project, 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM sitting in on a meeting, and 12:00 to 1:00 PM on your lunch break. At school, you might spend 6:30 to 7:00 AM taking the bus to school, 7:00 - 7:30 AM mentally preparing for the school day, and 7:30 to 9:00 AM sitting in English class."

That’s because you’re super focused on the countdown and nothing else. The same logic applies to your daily life and routine. The less you look at the clock, the quicker time seems to feel. [2] X Research source It can be hard to avoid the clock when it’s plastered to the corner of your computer screen. Try covering it up with a piece of tape so you aren’t constantly tempted to check it out. You can also try distracting yourself by making some top 10 lists of your favorite foods, games, video games, and the like. By focusing your attention on something else, you may not check the clock as much."

But as you get older and older, that 365-day gap hardly feels as endless. Apply that same principle to your day-to-day life—the more you regularly do and experience something, the less slow and boring it appears to be.
