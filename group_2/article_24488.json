      "content": "Lucky Patcher is legal, but many of its functions are illegal. It's illegal in many regions to remove license verification and get a paid app for free. It's also illegal to get in-app purchases for free or to distribute any of your cracked games (those paid apps you got for free). While it's unlikely that you'll get sued or put in jail for these actions, you can get banned from games that catch you using Lucky Patcher. Keep in mind that app and game developers depend on the money they earn from in-app purchases and ads. Using Lucky Patcher to avoid these is akin to stealing from those developers.
