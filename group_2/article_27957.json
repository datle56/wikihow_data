      "content": "Start with a clean vase. Before putting your roses on display, run your vase through the dishwasher or wash it thoroughly by hand with warm water and antibacterial soap. Using a clean container is important, as dirty vases often harbor germs and mineral and chemical deposits from tap water. [1] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Florist Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. If you use the same vase regularly, get in the habit of scrubbing it out between uses. Make sure the inside of the container is spotless. The residue left behind from previous flowers can also speed up the deterioration of your new roses."

      "content": "Fill your vase with distilled or purified water. Use bottled water to keep your cut roses moist, or invest in a water purification system to filter the water that comes out of your faucet. Roses do best in water with as close to a neutral pH as possible, which won’t cause them to shrivel and discolor the way water that’s too hard or soft will. [2] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Florist Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. If you’re using tap water in your vase, allow it to sit in the refrigerator overnight to give the chlorine time to dissipate before adding the roses. Water purification tablets can also help bring questionable water to a more amenable pH in a pinch. Drop in the specific number of tablets recommended in the product instructions for the amount of water you're using and wait at least 30 minutes before adding your roses.

      "content": "Add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the water in your vase. Ordinary granulated sugar is one of the simplest, most effective ways to keep cut flowers nourished. A good rule of thumb is to use roughly 2 tablespoons per quart of water. The roses will absorb the sugary solution through their stems and convert it to beneficial glucose, which will keep their cells and tissues lush and full. [4] X Research source Avoid using sugar substitutes, such as aspartame, saccharin, or stevia. Since these substances don’t break down the same way chemically, they won’t have the same effective on your roses. It’s important to remember that flowers are living things that need to eat, too, even if they’ve already been cut, stuck in a vase, and used to decorate your home."

      "title": "Keep your roses away from direct sunlight and heat.",
      "content": "Keep your roses away from direct sunlight and heat. Similar to produce, keeping cut flowers cool helps preserve them after they’ve been picked. Generally speaking, the cooler the environment, the better your cut roses will fare. Resist the temptation to situate them on a windowsill or in a picturesque sunbeam for long periods of time. Intense heat will quickly cause them to wither. Consider refrigerating your roses overnight, or anytime you don’t have them sitting out. Just make sure you keep them away from refrigerated produce, as the gases released by stored fruits and veggies can be bad for their longevity. [5] X Research source If you’re displaying your roses in a room that tends to be hot and stuffy, position them where they can receive some airflow, such as next to a main entrance, open window, or air conditioning vent."

      "title": "Display your flowers away from fruits and vegetables.",
      "content": "Display your flowers away from fruits and vegetables. As produce ages, it gives off ethylene, a gaseous compound that causes it to ripen. If your roses are too close, it’s possible for the ethylene in the surrounding air to have the same effect on them. For this reason, it’s best to choose either a fruit bowl or vase of fresh-cut roses for your centerpiece, not both. [6] X Research source Whenever possible, store produce and other fresh food items in the refrigerator. On the flipside, keeping your roses near your fruits and veggies will encourage them to bloom faster if they were cut while slightly immature."

      "content": "Cut your roses early in the day. The countdown on the lifespan of your roses begins when you remove them from the growing plant. So as not to waste a minute, gather your display flowers in the morning while they’re still fully hydrated. The warmer it gets outside, the more valuable moisture they’ll lose. [7] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source If you absolutely insist on cutting your roses in the afternoon or evening, do it immediately after watering to give them the best chance of survival. Pass over any roses at the florist or supermarket that appear limp or droopy. There's a good chance these flowers weren't well-hydrated at the time they were cut. Opt for locally-grown blooms if you're buying your roses. They'll last longer since they'll have been picked more recently. [8] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Florist Expert Interview. 12 March 2020."

      "content": "Change the water in your vase every 1-3 days. A good rule of thumb is to replace the water as soon as it starts to look cloudy, regardless of how long it's been. [9] X Expert Source Pilar Zuniga Florist Expert Interview. 12 March 2020. Refilling your display container regularly prevents bacteria from building up and ensures that your roses have a ready supply of fresh water to draw from. It also keeps the entire arrangement smelling pleasant. Don’t forget to add a little sugar to the new water. If necessary, top off the water level between replacements so that it reaches at least halfway up the stems."

      "content": "Trim 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the stems every time you refill your vase. Use a clean, sharp pair of pruning shears or blade to cut the stems diagonally. An angled cut increases the amount of surface area in contact with the water. As a result, your thirsty roses will be better able to drink their fill. It’s important that each cut you make be clean and precise. Handling your roses with a dull blade can mash the stems, making it harder for moisture to pass through the damaged cells.

      "title": "Plant your roses in a patch of well-drained soil.",
      "content": "Plant your roses in a patch of well-drained soil. Loose, crumbly soils do a better job of allowing water to pass through, which means your roses won’t be in danger of rotting or becoming oversaturated. This is essential for helping your roses thrive, as they require much more moisture than other types of flowers. After watering your roses, you should notice the soil beginning to dry out in a matter of hours. [11] X Research source Most varieties of roses prefer a soil with a pH between 5.5-7. You can test the pH of your soil using a home soil testing kit, which are typically available at gardening centers, greenhouses, and plant nurseries. [12] X Research source If you live somewhere with wet, soggy conditions year-round, consider mixing one-third sand or gravel into your growing soil to improve drainage."

Spread 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of a natural material like garden compost, cow or mushroom manure, or peat moss over your soil during the spring and summer when the most growth occurs. These additives are full of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that roses need to grow healthy and vibrant. [13] X Research source Following the first growing season, continue feeding your roses regularly every 1-2 months. Consult with a horticultural specialist at your local gardening center or greenhouse to find out what amendments will be most beneficial for the species of roses you’re cultivating."

      "content": "Mulch around your roses to help them retain moisture. Apply a layer of mulch 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) thick over the entire bed, leaving 5–6 inches (13–15 cm) around the base of the plants exposed for ventilation. Any type of packaged commercial mulch will do just fine, or you can spend some time shopping around for mixtures that have been formulated specifically for use on roses. For a thriftier approach, try recycling garden waste like leaves, wood chips, grass clippings, or even small stones into useful mulch. Be prepared to lay down new mulch once a year in the spring, or whenever the original layer becomes thinner than about 2 inches (5.1 cm). [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Water your roses 1-2 times a day.",
      "content": "Water your roses 1-2 times a day. The exact amount of water they’ll need depends largely on their species and size (as well as unique soil conditions). Your best bet is to wet the soil thoroughly without oversaturating it, then perform a touch test between waterings. When it feels dry, it’s time to give them another drink. Keep in mind that roses in containers will dry out more rapidly than those in the ground, which means they’ll need to be watered more frequently. Roses are thirsty plants, but care should be taken not to overwater them. Excessive moisture could lead to complications like wilting, blights, or root rot that can easily kill off an otherwise healthy plant."

      "content": "Deadhead spent blooms to stimulate new growth. When you notice an older flower that’s begun to droop or lose petals, use a pair of shears to snip the stem back to the first cluster of 5 leaves. Removing dead and dying flowers as soon as you come across them is one of the best ways to keep your roses alive and alluring. [15] X Research source Before you do any serious pruning, pull on a pair of elbow-length gloves to protect your hands and arms from wayward thorns. [16] X Research source Don’t hesitate to also trim any leaves, stems, or offshoots that appear unhealthy while you’re at it. It’s good practice to inspect your rose plants about twice a week during the flowering season to check for failing blooms."

      "content": "Treat your roses at the first sign of disease. When roses get sick, they invest their energy into fighting off the cause of the disease rather than growing and reproducing. Monitor your roses to look for warning signs like dropped petals, wilting, and discoloration. After cutting back any diseased or decaying foliage, spray the plants with an appropriate chemical or herbal fungicide to prevent any further damage. [17] X Research source Lingering moisture is an invitation to harmful bacteria and fungi. You can do your part to prevent disease by planting your roses where they can receive plenty of direct sunlight and allowing them to dry out completely between waterings. Common diseases that affect roses include blight, rust, and black spot. These ailments are often accompanied by visible symptoms such as pustules or dark spots or growths on the underside of the leaves."

      "content": "Prune your roses during their dormant period. The best time to spruce your roses is in later winter or early spring, just before they begin to explode with new blooms. Trim dead wood and older canes down to the greenish-white pith underneath, and don’t hesitate to remove more growth than you might think necessary. It’s typically safe to cut roses back by a third or even half of their original size.
