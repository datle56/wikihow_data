      "title": "Choose and print a template.",
      "content": "Choose and print a template. Find a template online by searching for free designs on blogs, or use the linked template at the bottom of this page. Download the image and prepare to print it in the size you need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Print the design onto cardstock.",
      "content": "Print the design onto cardstock. Make sure to use cardstock, not plain printer paper. Cardstock is thicker and sturdier, which will help hold the box together and keep it together. Printer paper will be too flimsy and may fall apart. Make sure to choose a paper size suitable for the size you want your boxes to be. For example, 8.5 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) paper will make small boxes that are more suitable for children. If you want larger boxes, try printing on 9 in × 12 in (23 cm × 30 cm) sheets or even 11 in × 14 in (28 cm × 36 cm). Before hitting print, make sure that your printer can handle the paper size and weight of the cardstock. Select the correct print settings under preferences. Cardstock will be somewhere between 50-110 lb. For a unique touch, you could print the design on a different color of cardstock, such as light blue or pink."

      "title": "Score the lines of the template.",
      "content": "Score the lines of the template. Use a bone folder or paper scoring wheel to score any lines that will need to fold in when you put together the box. Be careful not to cut all the way through the paper. Make sure to score the right side—the printed design side—so the paper will fold in the right direction."

    {
      "title": "Cut the box out with scissors.",
      "content": "Cut the box out with scissors. Carefully cut along the edges of the design, making sure not to cut off any flaps or tabs. Make your cuts straight so your box isn’t lopsided. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the box together.",
      "content": "Fold the box together. Make folds along the lines you’ve already scored and put the box together to make sure all the sides meet and match up. Check that all the correct flaps are in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Glue or tape the sides together with designated flaps or tabs.",
      "content": "Glue or tape the sides together with designated flaps or tabs. Your printable should include some flaps or tabs to attach the box’s sides to each other. Locate these extra panels and use non-toxic craft glue or tape to close off the box. Make sure to wipe off any excess glue, then let dry. Double-sided tape also works well for this step. When gluing or taping, make sure to align the edges carefully. You can bring the opposite side of the box down so that it is flush with the table's surface to ensure you are aligning the two pieces properly."

      "title": "Line with wax paper and fill with popcorn.",
      "content": "Line with wax paper and fill with popcorn. Wax paper will keep the butter and oil from soaking into the paper, so you can use the boxes again. Fill the box with your favorite flavor of popcorn and enjoy! When you’re done, throw away the used wax paper and re-line the box the next time you use it."

    {
      "title": "Choose your paper material.",
      "content": "Choose your paper material. White cardboard or posterboard are great options for this project because they’re sturdy and thick, but not too thick to cut through. You could also use a sheet of cardstock, either white or in the color of your choice."

    {
      "title": "Find a template or freehand your own.",
      "content": "Find a template or freehand your own. Print out a template and trace it onto your cardboard or posterboard, or simply draw out your own template. To make the lines straight and accurate, use a ruler and measure out each panel as well as tabs to attach the bottom and sides together. Include four main panels side by side--these should be tall and rectangular, tapering slightly at the bottom. Along the edge of one of the outer panels, add a long tab to connect the sides together. Add a rectangle below one panel for the bottom. The sides of the square should be the lengths of the panels’ bottom edges. Along the sides of the bottom square, add tabs to attach the bottom to the panels you fold it together. A standard size for the panels is 4 × 3 × 8 in (10.2 × 7.6 × 20.3 cm)."

      "content": "Cut out the pieces with scissors, an X-acto knife, or a box cutter. Depending on how thick your paper is, choose the correct tool to cut out your design. You may also want to use a ruler with the knife tools to make straight cuts. If you’re using cardboard, you should use a box cutter and a ruler. If you’re using posterboard, an X-acto knife with a ruler should be sharp enough to cut through the material. If you choose to use cardstock, scissors will be sufficient to cut out your design."

If you use tape, place transparent or double-sided tape along the edges or flaps and press to close the box. [2] X Research source"
