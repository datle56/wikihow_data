      "content": "Choose a ribbon without wires that is 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) wide. You can make roses out of silk , satin , or grosgrain (fabric) ribbon , as long as they don’t have any wires inside of them. Wire ribbon won’t look as natural and may be harder to shape. Use pink or red ribbon for a traditional rose, or use bright colors or patterned ribbon for a festive look. [1] X Research source The width of the ribbon determines the size of your rose. A wider ribbon creates a bigger rose. For a small ribbon rose, use a ribbon that’s 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) wide."

      "title": "Cut your ribbon to about 36 inches (91 cm).",
      "content": "Cut your ribbon to about 36 inches (91 cm). Use tape measure to ensure your ribbon is the right length. It’s better to have excess than to fall short. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut your ribbon for your rose. Cut the material at a slight angle to avoid fraying. [2] X Research source The cut you make doesn’t have to look perfect, since it will be hidden inside of your finished rose."

      "content": "Leaving a 3 in (7.6 cm) tail, fold the ribbon over itself. Position your ribbon horizontally and leave 3 inches (7.6 cm) to your left. Take the long side of the ribbon on the right and fold it downward over itself, creating a 90-degree angle. Press down on the fold with your fingers so that it stays in place. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rotate the ribbon and make another fold.",
      "content": "Rotate the ribbon and make another fold. Right now, the long end is hanging down toward you and the tail of the ribbon is pointing left. Rotate it counterclockwise so the tail is hanging down and the long end is pointing right. Finally, fold the long end down over itself, mirroring the already folded side. [4] X Research source Keep one hand on the central folds of your ribbon so they don’t come loose. As you fold, leave a small slit in the middle of all the folds. You’ll need to pull the tail through the center of your folds at the end."

      "title": "Continue rotating and folding, creating a square.",
      "content": "Continue rotating and folding, creating a square. To make a new fold, rotate the ribbon counterclockwise (toward your left) and bring the long end down, creating a right angle. After the fourth fold, your ribbon will begin to resemble a square with four right angles. Keep doing this until you run out of material. [5] X Research source Crease each fold that you make so that it stays in place."

      "title": "Pinch the stack of folds together with your fingers.",
      "content": "Pinch the stack of folds together with your fingers. Pick up the folds that you made with your ribbon and keep them pinched together between your thumb and pointer finger. [6] X Research source If the material comes loose, it will fold out into an accordion. Fold it back up into a square. Optionally, use scissors to cut one of the tail ends of your ribbon folds to make it pointed instead of straight for a more realistic center of your rose."

Pull the ribbon through the small hole in the center of your square. If you have trouble getting it through, use a pair of small tweezers to grab the ribbon and pull it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Twist the layers around until they form a rose shape. Grab the pulled-through tail at the back center of your rose. Holding an edge of the folded square, twist it clockwise until the center squeezes together and forms a rose petal shape. Twist these as much or as little as you want to until your silk, satin, or grosgrain ribbon rose looks like a real flower. [8] X Research source More twists will result in a tighter rose shape."

      "content": "Tie your ribbon tails at the back of the rose and cut the excess. Grab the ends of the ribbon that are sticking out and tie them in a knot so they don’t come loose. Use sharp scissors to cut the ends of the ribbon off so you don’t have loose material hanging off of your flower. Alternatively, twist the tails and pinch them together. Wrap a small piece of clear tape around them at the base of the flower. Trim the excess ribbon. [9] X Research source You can also use a smaller ribbon to tie your rose’s ribbon tail ends together before trimming the excess."

Choose either silk , satin , or grosgrain (fabric) ribbon , but make sure that it doesn’t have any type of wire framing inside of it. Wire could complicate the shaping of your rose. Choose red or pink ribbon for a classic rose design, or be bold with cream, yellow, or orange. [10] X Research source"

The longer your material is, the larger your rose will be. Cut the edge in a straight line to make it easier to work with. [11] X Research source If you are worried about your material fraying, apply a liquid fray check to the cut edge and let it dry before you make your rose."

Twirl the center of the rose clockwise to press the glue into it and set the petal in place. [17] X Research source Hold the ribbon horizontally the entire time. Keep the folds tight so that they combine to look like a rose. The purpose of folding the ribbon over is so that there are no edges showing in your rose."
