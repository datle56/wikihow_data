Describe any symptoms you've been experiencing to your doctor, especially things like mental fogginess and overall fatigue, so your doctor can make an assessment. They'll most likely want to do routine bloodwork to check your B12 levels. If your doctor feels you're a good candidate for vitamin B12 injections, they'll give you a prescription for a certain dosage. Doctors estimate 1.5% to 15% of people have vitamin B12 deficiency. Adults over the age of 60 are much more likely to experience this issue, but it can happen to people of all ages.

It's best to follow their directions and use this article as a refresher. You can fill your prescription at any local pharmacy. Avoid exceeding your recommended dosage on the medication. Your doctor may require regular blood tests to monitor your body's reaction to the injections. This is normal."

If you have difficulty absorbing B12 in food or oral supplements, injections can be a big help. Vegetarians may also benefit from vitamin B12 supplements . Some doctors may even prescribe B12 injections to prevent deficiencies before they start (especially if your bloodwork's numbers are on the low side). [2] X Research source B12 injections may help with a wide range of symptoms like mental and physical fatigue, irritability, and numbness or tingling in your hands and feet. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Common conditions like gastritis, anemia, and Crohn's disease can diminish your B12 levels. If you have one of those conditions, getting B12 injections can prevent a deficiency before it starts. Vitamin B12 injections alone are not medically proven to help with weight loss. If you're deficient in B12, injections can increase your energy and well-being (which may lead to weight loss). [4] X Research source"

Some people aren't good candidates for this treatment, so be sure to let your doctor know if you have any allergies or health conditions. For example, you shouldn't use this medication if you're allergic to cyanocobalamin or cobalt, or if you have Leber’s disease, which is an inherited form of vision loss. [5] X Research source Avoid B12 shots if: You have kidney or liver disease. You're iron or folic acid deficient. You're experiencing any kind of infection.

A healthcare professional should administer your first shot so they can monitor your reaction and check for any adverse effects. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are 4 common injection sites for administering B12, but you'll want to discuss what's best for you with your doctor. The injection sites are: Thigh: This site works best if you're self-administering your own injections, or if you're giving an injection to an infant or child. It’s a good spot because of the high amount of fat and muscle under the skin of your thigh. The target muscle, vastus lateralis, is halfway between your groin and your knee, about 6–8 in (15–20 cm) from the crease of your leg. Outer hip: This site is located on the side of your body just below the hip bone, and it's a good spot for young people and adults. Most doctors advise using this area since there are no major blood vessels or nerves nearby that could be punctured by a needle. Upper arm: This site is best for young or middle-aged adults. Older adults can use this site if the muscle in their upper arm, their deltoid, is well developed. If you're dose is higher than 1mL, avoid injecting into the upper arm. Buttocks: The upper, outer buttocks, or Dorsogluteals, are located on either side of your body. Only a medical professional should use this site because it's really close to major blood vessels and your sciatic nerve (which could be damaged if the injection is not administered properly)."

      "content": "Choose an injection method. Though it may seem like a pretty straightforward process to inject someone with a needle and a plunger, there are 2 injection methods that can be used for a vitamin B12 injection: [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Intramuscular : These injections are common because they tend to have better results. The needle is inserted at a 90-degree angle, deep into the muscular tissue. Once the needle is in the muscle, the plunger is pulled back slightly to ensure the needle is not in a blood vessel. If no blood is aspirated, then the medication can be pushed through slowly. The surrounding muscle will absorb the medication right away. Subcutaneous : These injections are less common. The needle is inserted at a 45-degree angle, just below the skin, as opposed to deep into a muscle. The outer skin may be pulled away from the muscle tissue to ensure the needle doesn't pierce the muscle. This type of injection is best administered in the upper arm."

Remove the needle from the container and give a slight push on the syringe to dispel a tiny amount of the vitamin B12 supplement before you insert the needle into your skin to ensure the air is out of the syringe. [13] X Research source If you're injecting someone else, let them know you're about to inject the supplement. If the person appears nervous or tense , advise them to put their weight on the leg or arm that you aren't injecting to help relax the muscles. [14] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source Doctors usually recommend intramuscular injections, which is what we're describing. For subcutaneous injections, pinch the skin and poke the needle in at a 90-degree angle, almost like you're throwing a dart, so it barely goes beneath the surface. The rest of the process is the same, so proceed to the next steps. [15] X Research source"

You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for a puncture proof disposal container that you can use at home, such as a sharps container, or make your own container. To make your own container, duct tape the lid onto a metal coffee can. Cut a slit in the lid that's wide enough for needles to fit through. Label the can so you know it contains needles. Alternatively, store your used needles in a thick plastic detergent bottle. Label the container and keep the lid on at all times. [17] X Research source When the can is three-quarters full, take it to your doctor’s office, a bio-hazard collection site, a hazardous waste center, or a syringe exchange program for disposal. Alternatively, enroll in a residential \"special waste\" program that will come pick up your needles.
