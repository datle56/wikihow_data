      "title": "Cut the vanilla beans open and scrape out the paste.",
      "content": "Cut the vanilla beans open and scrape out the paste. To create the vanilla essence for the perfume, you need fresh vanilla beans. Use a sharp knife to cut 8 to10 beans open lengthwise so you expose the paste inside. Scrape the paste out of the beans with the knife, and chop the bean shells into pieces. Place both the paste and chopped shells in a small glass jar that has a lid. [1] X Research source Vanilla beans can be fairly expensive, so it’s usually best to buy them in bulk. You can make larger batches of perfume and give it as gifts for special occasions. Scraping the paste out of more beans means you’ll create a more intense vanilla essence. However, if the beans are large, you may only need 8 or so."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the vodka over the vanilla bean paste.",
      "content": "Pour the vodka over the vanilla bean paste. After you’ve scraped out the vanilla bean paste and chopped up the shells, add vodka to the glass jar. You should pour enough liquid to cover the paste and chopped shells completely, with approximately ¼-inch (6.35-mm) more on top of the vanilla beans. Be sure to use vodka that’s at least 70 proof."
    },
    {
      "title": "Infuse the vodka with the vanilla for at least several weeks.",
      "content": "Infuse the vodka with the vanilla for at least several weeks. When the vanilla bean paste and shells and vodka are mixed, cover the jar. Store it in a cool, dark location for three weeks to three months. The fragrance will come out of the vanilla bean paste and shells to scent and color the vodka. The longer you allow the vanilla to infuse the vodka, the stronger your perfume’s fragrance will be. Check on the essence periodically while it’s steeping to analyze the scent and color. When the vanilla scent is strong and the color is rich and dark, the essence is ready. Shake the mixture every so often while it’s steeping to ensure that the scent is distributed throughout the liquid."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test the scent of the liquid on your skin.",
      "content": "Test the scent of the liquid on your skin. Even if the vanilla essence smells and looks right, it’s important to test it out before you make the perfume oil. Dab a small amount of the liquid on the inside of your wrist, and allow it to dry for 5 to 10 seconds. Smell it, and if you’re happy with the scent, you can mix up the perfume oil. If the vanilla fragrance isn’t strong enough when you test it on your skin, leave the mixture to steep for longer."

      "title": "Stretch nylon stocking or cheesecloth over a glass jar.",
      "content": "Stretch nylon stocking or cheesecloth over a glass jar. Find a clean glass jar that you want to store your perfume in, and place a piece of nylon stocking or cheesecloth over the opening. Make sure the nylon or cheesecloth piece is long enough to hang over the sides, so you can secure the fabric with a rubber band or piece of string. [2] X Research source Make sure sure that the jar or container you choose for your perfume has a lid for airtight storage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strain the vanilla essence through the material.",
      "content": "Strain the vanilla essence through the material. When the nylon or cheesecloth is secured over the top of the jar, pour the vanilla and vodka mixture through the fabric. That will catch any vanilla bean residue or particles to strain them from the vanilla essence. You can save the leftover vanilla residue and use it for more perfume in the future. Store it in an airtight jar, and add some fresh vanilla bean paste and shells to it when you’re ready to make a new batch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add jojoba oil to the jar with the vanilla essence.",
      "content": "Add jojoba oil to the jar with the vanilla essence. With the vanilla essence in the perfume jar or container, pour in approximately 1 ounce (30 ml) of jojoba oil. There should be double the amount of oil as there is vanilla essence, so you may need to use more or less of the oil, depending on how much essence you wind up with. [3] X Research source You can substitute sweet almond oil for the jojoba oil if you prefer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the jar to combine the oil and vanilla.",
      "content": "Shake the jar to combine the oil and vanilla. To ensure that the vanilla essence is completely mixed with the oil, place the lid on the jar and shake it gently. The two may separate when you store the perfume oil, so be sure to shake it before each use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the perfume in a cool, dark place.",
      "content": "Store the perfume in a cool, dark place. Once the oil and vanilla essence are mixed, the perfume oil is ready to use. When you’re not using it, keep the jar in a cool, dark to help preserve it. The perfume oil should be good for approximately 3 to 4 months if stored properly."
