      "content": "Plan ahead. Think about what you want to do and how long it will take. For example, if you need to plan an outfit and shave your beard, you may only need an hour or so. However, if you want to do makeup and style your hair, you will need as much time as you can get. If you’re on a time crunch, try to do some things ahead of time. For example: Plan your outfit the day before. Do your hair before you go to work or school. If you dye your hair, touch up your roots a few days in advance."

      "content": "Choose clothing that makes you feel good. If you want to have a good time at a party, wear something that makes you feel comfortable and attractive. Avoid wearing anything that makes you feel awkward. Otherwise, you may come across as awkward at the party. For instance, if your shoes hurt when you try them on, they will only get worse once you get to the party. Instead, choose shoes that are comfortable to stand in. It's a good idea to wear something in your closet that you already know makes you look good—something new might not fit how you imagine it will, which could affect your confidence.
