      "content": "Mix together 1 cup (120 g) of flour and 1 cup (237 ml) of warm water. Place the flour and water into a large bowl. Use a whisk to mix the flour and water together. Continue mixing until the water and flour has formed a glue and is a batter-like consistency. [1] X Research source Sift the flour first if you want the papier mâché to be super smooth. Add more warm water if the mixture is too thick. You can also make papier mâché mixture out of elmer's glue and water.

      "title": "Cut 10 sheets of A3 newspaper into long strips.",
      "content": "Cut 10 sheets of A3 newspaper into long strips. Use scissors to neatly cut the sheets of newspaper into strips that are approximately 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) long and 4–6 in (10–15 cm) wide. Alternatively, you can rip the newspaper into strips if you prefer. Make sure that the strips are roughly these dimensions, as the strips will be easiest to work with at this size. [3] X Research source You can use an old comic or magazine instead of a newspaper if you prefer. You probably won’t need a whole newspaper worth of strips, however, it is better to have too many than to run out while you are making your mask."

      "content": "Cover the face that the mask will be molded on with petroleum jelly. Rub a generous amount of petroleum jelly over your friend’s face. This prevents the papier mâché from sticking to their face and helps the mask to come away cleanly. [4] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Pay special attention to their hairline, eyebrows, and upper lip, as this is where the papier mâché is most likely to stick. [5] X Research source Alternatively, use aloe vera gel instead of petroleum jelly. Make sure that your friend has their hair out of their face and tied back if necessary before you start applying the papier mâché."

      "title": "Dip each newspaper strip into the glue mixture before you apply it.",
      "content": "Dip each newspaper strip into the glue mixture before you apply it. Each newspaper strip needs to have an even coating of glue before it can be applied to your friend’s face. Make sure that the full length and both sides of each strip is covered in glue. If you are using a glossy magazine rather than a newspaper, spend a few extra seconds soaking each strip in the glue mixture. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Place 1 layer of strips along your friend’s jawline, forehead, and nose.",
      "content": "Place 1 layer of strips along your friend’s jawline, forehead, and nose. Begin to apply strips of newspaper to your friend’s face and make sure that each one rests flat. Place the strips across your friend’s forehead, down their jawline following the angle, and across the bridge of their nose. Cut the strips shorter if they are too long for parts of your friend's face. Don’t worry about creating layers of newspaper strips just yet. Just focus on covering these areas of your friend’s face. Be careful not to block your friend's nostrils with newspaper as you work on their nose."

      "title": "Cover your friend’s cheeks and chin with the papier mâché strips.",
      "content": "Cover your friend’s cheeks and chin with the papier mâché strips. Work on broadly covering your friends face with strips of newspaper, with each strip slightly overlapping the previous one to help the mask stick together. Connect the different areas of papier mâché on their face using more strips. Leave the areas around their eyes, nostrils, and mouth open. As long as your friend can breathe comfortably through their nose, you can cover their mouth with papier mâché too if you prefer. This means that you will be able to cut out the mouth shape when the mask is dry."

      "title": "Fill in the missing sections with papier mâché.",
      "content": "Fill in the missing sections with papier mâché. Cut the strips of newspaper slightly smaller so that they can be thin and short enough to cover areas like in between the eyebrows, across the upper lip, and down the septum. Carefully place these strips of newspaper to connect each part of the mask. Provided that your friend can safely breathe and open their eyes, it’s better to make the openings in the mask slightly too small rather than too large. This is because it’s easy to cut the openings to size once the mask has dried. Don’t worry if there are overlapping sections of papier mâché."

      "title": "Add 2 layers of papier mâché to the mask to create a smooth finish.",
      "content": "Add 2 layers of papier mâché to the mask to create a smooth finish. Use the newspaper strips to go over all of your previous work on the mask. Smooth down every strip as you apply to make sure that your mask isn’t bumpy. Ensure that every part of the mask is even and has approximately 3 layers overall."

      "content": "Let the mask dry on your friend's face for approximately 2-3 hours. Wait until the mask feels firm and only slightly wet. If the mask is taking too long to dry, use a blow dryer to speed up the process. [7] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. The mask won’t be entirely set just yet, as it needs to dry fully overnight."

      "content": "Remove the mask from your friend’s face once it feels firm. Have your friend slowly scrunch up their face. Hold your hands right in front of the mask to catch it as it comes away. If needed, gently pry the mask away from their skin at the edges, being very careful not to dent or damage the mask. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Place more papier mâché on the mask to add small, extra features.",
      "content": "Place more papier mâché on the mask to add small, extra features. Build up areas of your mask such as the cheekbones, chin, eyebrows, or lips with extra layers of newspaper and glue. This will make your mask appear less flat and more comical. [10] X Research source This is the easiest way to add wrinkles to your mask. Once the papier mâché layers are dry, your mask should feel firm and not flimsy. Add more layers if the mask feels too weak. [11] X Research source If your mask is just for display and is not going to be worn, you can cover the eyes and breathing holes with papier mâché if you prefer."

      "content": "Create molds and papier mâché over these to form large features. Crumple up some newspaper into the shape of the feature that you are wanting to make. Use masking tape to attach this to your mask. Then, place papier mâché over the mold to make the surface smooth. [12] X Research source Creating molds is useful when you want to add larger features to your mask such as horns, a beak, or a long nose. Wait until all of the extra layers have dried before decorating your mask further. This may take an extra 1-2 days depending on the weather and how many layers need to dry."
