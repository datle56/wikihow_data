Then, measure another 17.5 inches (44 cm) up from those marks. Continue until you reach the top of the post. [3] X Research source There should be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) between the final mark and the top of the post. You'll use the marks to determine where your eye bolts need to be drilled in later on."

      "content": "Drill eye bolts into the corners of the posts along the marks you made. First, drill pilot holes through the corners of the posts and out the other side. Then, screw the eye bolts into the posts so they’re sticking straight out from the corners. The ends of the eye bolts should go all the way through the posts and stick out on the opposite side. Secure the eye bolts with the nuts that came with them. [4] X Research source Use eye bolts that are .5 inches (1.3 cm) wide by 1 foot (0.30 m) long. You’ll need 12 eye bolts in total — 3 for each post."

The size of your wrestling ring is up to you, but try to keep it between 8 feet (2.4 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) and 16 feet (4.9 m) by 16 feet (4.9 m).

The length of the pieces will depend on how big your ring is. To determine the length, measure the distance between 2 of your posts and add 12 inches (30 cm). The extra 12 inches (30 cm) is so the pieces of wood extend over the sides of the posts (each post is 6 inches (15 cm) wide). You may need to cut the wooden pieces down to size, depending on the size of your ring."

Line the ends of the pieces of wood up with the corners of the posts. Then, use a drill or hammer to fasten the ends of the wood to the posts. When you’re finished, the pieces of wood should make a square frame around your wrestling ring, with the posts in the corners. [8] X Research source"

Lay the tires or mattresses on the ground inside the frame so they’re in a flat, even layer that stretches across the whole floor space. [9] X Research source You can find cheap, old mattresses at your local thrift store. Reach out to your local junkyard to see if they have old tires you can use for your ring. Use only tires or only mattresses for your ring."

To test out your ring, walk across the floor and hop up and down a few times — if the floor bends or buckles under your weight, check to make sure it's securely fastened to the frame. You should also test the ropes by leaning into them with all of your body weight. If they don't stay taut when you lean into them, tighten the ropes and make sure they're securely tied off on the turnbuckles. It's also a good idea to double-check the padding on the turnbuckles. If any of the padding feels loose, reattach it to the turnbuckles so it's secure."
