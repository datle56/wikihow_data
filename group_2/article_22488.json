Maintenance food is generally canned, and should be available at pet supply stores or wherever cat food is sold.

If you want to ensure quality, you can look for cat food that is certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). If your cat is reluctant to eat, you can warm its food first, offer its favorites, or try giving it small portions. If it still does not want to eat after 24 hours, contact a vet.

After a few days on a bland diet, begin mixing a small portion of your cat’s regular food with the bland foods. Start with something like 1 part regular food to 3 parts bland food. If your cat seems to handle the mixed food without a problem, wait a day or two and mix one-half regular food and one-half bland food. After a day or so of that, try 3 parts regular food to one part bland food. If that also works, then you can go back to feeding your cat only its regular food."
