      "content": "The Kennedy curse is a series of tragedies occurring in the Kennedy family. These tragic events include unexpected deaths, accidents, and assassinations that have all occurred in a short amount of time within the famous and wealthy family. The descendents of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., in particular, have suffered these misfortunes. Due to the number of unfortunate incidents in this family line—including multiple political assassinations and plane crashes—many people have speculated about a supposed curse placed on the family. [1] X Research source Some believers point to the fact that not just the family themselves have been affected. In fact, many family friends, associates, and other relatives of the Kennedys have been killed or injured in freak accidents or tragedies. For instance, Athalia Ponsell Lindsley, former fiancee of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., was murdered at her home in 1974. [2] X Research source In other examples, Ted Kennedy survived a 1964 plane crash that killed one of his aides and the pilot, while Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. survived a 1973 car crash that paralyzed his passenger (Pam Kelley) and injured his brother (David A. Kennedy). [3] X Research source Ted Kennedy himself was quoted as questioning if “some awful curse did actually hang over all the Kennedys.” [4] X Research source"

Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy (making her sister to President John F. Kennedy). She was born with intellectual disabilities, which made her family perceive her as behaviorally-challenged when compared to her siblings. In 1941, when Rosemary was 23, her father decided to have a lobotomy performed and neglected to inform the rest of the family until after the procedure. [5] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source At the time, lobotomies were extremely experimental and were not accepted by the American Medical Association. Supporters of the lobotomy claimed that it would reduce depression and aggression. Instead, in Rosemary’s case, the procedure left her with severe and permanent brain damage. From then on, the eldest Kennedy daughter had a diminished intellectual capacity and was unable to effectively walk or talk. As a result, Rosemary was sent to live the rest of her life isolated in an institution where her situation was kept secret by the family for decades. Only later in life did her family begin to visit her, until her passing away in 2005."

In an event known as the Chappaquiddick incident, Ted Kennedy (brother of JFK and RFK) drove his car off of a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts. Mary Jo Kopechne, who was a passenger in the vehicle, died inside the car after it overturned in Poucha Pond shortly after midnight on July 19th, 1969. Kennedy was able to swim free from the car, but he maintained in his statements that he tried and failed to rescue Kopechne from the vehicle. [14] X Research source Kennedy, who was a U.S. senator at the time, neglected to report the incident to the police for more than 10 hours. Instead, he fled the crash site. Kopechne’s body had already been retrieved from Kennedy’s car by a diver. A few days later, Kennedy pled guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended jail sentence. Some claimed that Kennedy had been operating his vehicle negligently or recklessly, although he maintained that his car merely skidded off of the narrow bridge. As a result of this incident, Kennedy decided not to run for president in 1972 and 1976. The death of Kopechne, particularly with Kennedy’s inconsistent story about the events causing the crash, is likely to have undermined his chances of ever becoming president. He did run for office in 1980, but lost the nomination to Jimmy Carter. [15] X Research source Mary Jo Kopechne was 28 years old and one of the “Boiler Room Girls,” a close group of women who worked on Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign.

Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy, was piloting the single-engine plane, which also carried his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette. [20] X Research source At 38 years old, JFK Jr. had had his pilot’s license for just over one year at the time of the crash. He was certified to fly under favorable weather conditions, but he did not have an instrument rating—meaning he wasn’t practiced in navigating through low-visibility weather. According to official reports, weather conditions were initially forecasted to be fair during the flight. However, at the time of takeoff, visibility was reduced and Kennedy reportedly became disoriented in the hazy weather. The plane crashed about an hour into its flight. Kennedy was reported missing by a relative the next morning, and the U.S. Air Force and the Coast Guard launched a search for the plane around Martha’s Vineyard. On July 21st, the bodies of John, Carolyn, and Lauren were recovered by divers from the plane’s underwater wreckage. The crash was a huge news story at the time, considering JFK Jr.’s status as the former president’s son and that the incident supported the supposed Kennedy “curse.” The public also empathized with the Bessette family, who lost two children and later reached a settlement for wrongful death with JFK Jr.’s estate."

      "content": "Historians, on the other hand, blame a family history of ruthless achievement and hubris. Instead of a supernatural curse, most experts claim that the Kennedy misfortunes result from a combination of hubris, arrogance, and narcissism. Author Edward Klein, for instance, writes about how early founders of the Kennedy empire may have been engaging in outrageous behaviors due to feelings of vulnerability or social stigma around being Irish. Once the family’s social status and wealth had been established, later generations, who grew up with ample money and privilege, may have engaged in thrill-seeking and risky behaviors due to feelings of entitlement and an invincible arrogance. [29] X Research source Klein also mentions the parenting styles of Joe and Rose Kennedy. Joe allegedly pushed hard for extreme excellence and victory on behalf of his children, while Rose Kennedy was a strict disciplinarian who emphasized religious devotion in her mothering. In more modern interpretations, a 2024 book by Maureen Callahan, Ask Not: The Kennedys and the Women They Destroyed , argues that the true “curse” of the Kennedys is the womanizing and misogyny committed by male members of the family. [30] X Research source In January 2025, Caroline Kennedy also accused her cousin Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. of encouraging his siblings to abuse drugs, alcohol, and other illegal substances. [31] X Research source While Caroline Kennedy didn’t allude to the curse in any way, it is notable that multiple Kennedys have died of drug overdoses—incidents which are often used to demonstrate the “curse.”"

The idea of a curse being set on the Kennedy clan is largely debated and there’s no clear way to prove the theory true.

[32] X Research source However, while there’s no scientific or historical basis for the curse, it remains a popular belief. The Kennedy family has endured multiple plane crashes, drug overdoses, and assassinations, as well as fatal skiing, boating, and car accidents, so it’s not surprising that the public has connected these tragic incidents with the idea of a curse. The prospect of a “curse” became especially popular after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident, in which Ted Kennedy publicly mused on the idea of a family curse after his own car accident that took the life of his passenger.

Kennedy’s assassination on November 22, 1963, there have been numerous conspiracy theories around the truth of his death and doubts surrounding the official story shared by the United States government. According to official reports and the conclusion drawn by the Warren Commission, JFK was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, who acted alone. This version of events is often referred to as “the lone gunman” theory. [35] X Research source The conspiracy theories, on the other hand, allege that various entities such as the CIA, Mafia, or KGB may have been involved. Other popular stories speculate that then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro were involved. Most of these theories were spawned by pieces of evidence included in the Warren Commission’s findings. For example, there were contradictions among witnesses on the number of shots heard and where they were shot from. Critics also claim that it would be nearly impossible for Oswald to fire three shots in 8.6 seconds and successfully hit his target in a moving vehicle. While labeled as a conspiracy theory, an overwhelming number of Americans believe that there was some sort of cover-up surrounding JFK’s death. As of 2023, 65% of U.S. citizens believe that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. [36] X Research source"

This theory originates from the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe, in which William Henry Harrison (who later became president) fought on Native American grounds against a group of warriors led by Tecumseh. The battle became so famous that Harrison’s nickname became “Old Tippecanoe.” However, Harrison’s victory was so angering to the Native Americans that they (allegedly) placed a curse on his name. [37] X Research source Soon thereafter, William Henry Harrison was elected to be President of the United States in 1840. However, President Harrison died in office from pneumonia just one month after his inauguration. From then on, nearly every president who was elected in a year ending with “0” died in office, including: Abraham Lincoln (elected 1860, assassinated in 1865) James A. Garfield (elected 1880, assassinated in 1881) William McKinley (elected 1900, assassinated in 1901) Warren G. Harding (elected 1920, died of pneumonia in 1923) Franklin D. Roosevelt (elected in 1940, died of a brain hemorrhage in 1945) John F. Kennedy (elected 1960, assassinated in 1963) The only president who’s died in office but wasn’t elected in a “0” year was Zachary Taylor. President Taylor died in 1850 after being elected in 1848.

According to official reports, the iconic American actress and model died of an accidental overdose. However, many people are suspicious of these reports, as Monroe was romantically linked to then-President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, at the time of her death. [39] X Research source Robert Kennedy is more so tied to the death of Monroe, as an alleged tape of the night of her death contains audio of Robert’s voice alongside Monroe’s screams. [40] X Research source During a BBC interview in 1983, the actress’ former live-in housekeeper, Eunice Murray, also seemed to verify that Bobby Kennedy was at the house on the night that Monroe died. [41] X Research source Fueling the rumors of the Kennedys’ involvement, multiple people close to the investigation were given high-profile new jobs after their investigation concluded that Monroe’s death was an accidental overdose. Marilyn’s publicist was given a job with the U.S. Information Agency, for example. [42] X Research source However, while many believe that the Kennedys covered up something around Monroe’s death, they don’t necessarily believe that the Kennedy brothers murdered her. Instead, the cover up may have only served to hide the affairs that the two brothers allegedly had with the star—especially with the allegation that Bobby was at her home shortly before her death. Others do believe that Monroe’s death was caused by the Kennedys—Joe DiMaggio, baseball legend and former husband of the actress, claimed that all of the Kennedys were “lady-killers” and that they “did in [his] poor Marilyn.” [43] X Research source"
