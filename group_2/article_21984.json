      "content": "Stop picking the flowers to encourage seed production. Picking flowers from a plant encourages more flower production. But to harvest seeds, you need the sweet pea to stop producing flowers and focus its energy on producing pods instead. When the weather becomes hotter and drier later in the summer, stop picking the sweet pea flowers. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the plant go to seed.",
      "content": "Let the plant go to seed. When you stop harvesting flowers and pruning the sweet peas, they will go to seed. When this happens, the flowers will die off and the sweet peas will start to form pods that are full of seeds. Then, you'll have to wait for the pods to develop and brown before you can pick them.

      "content": "Watch for the pods to go brown. As the pods develop, they will swell as the seeds form inside of them. Leave the pods and the plants alone, and over the course of a couple of weeks, the pods will turn from a light green to a yellowish green to a paper-bag brown. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick the pods when they're paper bag brown. When the pods change from yellowish green to brown, trim the pods from the flowers using gardening sheers. Trim the pods so there some stem left on them, as this will make them easier to dry. [4] X Research source Harvest the pods before the weather turns wet and rainy, because the water can cause the seeds to germinate. You don’t want that if you're looking to save the seeds to plant next year. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Hang the pods to dry.",
      "content": "Hang the pods to dry. When you’ve collected the pods, group them into bunches of five to 10. Tie the bunches together by wrapping string or elastic around the stems. Hang the bunches from a clothesline or door handle in a cool, dry place. Use hooks, string, or clothespins to fasten the bunches to the clothesline or handle. Leave the pods to dry for several days to a week, until the pods start splitting open. [6] X Research source A good place to dry the pods is a garage or dry basement."

      "content": "Break open the splitting pods. When the pods have had a few days to dry and are starting to split open, remove them from where they're hanging. Unwrap the elastics holding the bunches together, and lay the pods on a clean cloth. Use your nail or a knife to pry the pods open at the seams."

Close the flap and label the envelope with the type of seeds and the date. Store the seeds somewhere cool and dark until you're ready to plant them in the spring.

As soon as the soil can be worked in the late winter or early spring, get ready to plant the seeds. In climates with mild winters where the ground doesn’t freeze, you can actually plant the seeds in October or November to have early spring flowers.

Use a pair of nail clippers to make a small nick in each seed right before planting. This will speed up the germination process and increase the chances of success when you plant.

Use the sharpened end of a pencil to poke holes in the soil inside the trench, and then drop a single seed into each hole. Cover the holes with a bit of soil and press down to encase the seeds with soil. [14] X Research source"
