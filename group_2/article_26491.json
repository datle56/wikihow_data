Rotate your arms so your palms face out and your forearm and upper-arm create a 90-degree angle. Exhale as you use your chest muscles to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the push and breathe for a second. Lower the weights slowly as you inhale. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Perform 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps of this exercise. To determine how much weight you should use, figure out the heaviest weight you can use for 1 rep. Then figure out about 60 to 70 percent of that weight for your regular set. For example, if the heaviest weight you can use for 1 rep is 10 lb (4.5 kg), then you should use 6 lb (2.7 kg) dumbbells for your sets. If it begins to feel like there's hardly any resistance with the weight you're using, try the heaviest weight test again and readjust the weights you use."

[20] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 March 2020. If you’re using a smaller plate for your meals, try to make sure at least half that plate is taken up by vegetables. Use snack-size food storage bags to make your snacks. For example, if you buy a big bag of low-calorie popcorn, divide that large bag into several smaller bags. You’re less likely to eat the whole bag that way! Use the measuring cups to actually measure out servings. If you make a recipe with a 1 c (240 mL) serving size, actually measure it out with a 1 c (240 mL) measuring cup. It will help you learn what serving sizes look like. Try tracking your daily food intake and portion sizes in a food diary to better understand your eating habits and how they affect your body. Reader Poll: We asked 240 wikiHow readers and 50% said that they don’t track their food intake .
