      "title": "Wait until temperatures are below freezing.",
      "content": "Wait until temperatures are below freezing. Most freezers are set to 0 °F (−18 °C) and it usually takes around 3-4 hours to make ice cubes at this temperature. However, as long as temperatures are below 32 °F (0 °C), water will eventually freeze. Boiling water freezes faster than cold water."

      "title": "Wait for the ice to freeze.",
      "content": "Wait for the ice to freeze. The amount of time it will take for the water to freeze will depend on how cold it is outside and how big your ice cubes are. Check on the ice cubes every hour or so until they are ready. [4] X Research source"

Use water that is safe to drink to make ice cubes. [5] X Research source Make sure you only add water to the maximum fill line marked on the reservoir."

      "content": "Plug in the ice maker and turn it on. You will need a reliable power source while the ice maker is running. Some brands of ice makers will immediately start to make ice as soon as you turn them on, while others might require you to press another button or choose an ice size.

With most machines, you should have enough ice for 2 drinks in around 5-15 minutes. [7] X Research source Some machines will also allow you to choose what size ice cubes you want to make. Most brands take around 1-2 hours to completely fill the tray with ice."

To disinfect it, fill the reservoir with a 10 to 1 solution of water and lemon juice or white vinegar and run one cycle. Throw out the ice and wipe down the machine. [8] X Research source Ice makers are prone to mold and slime because when they are not in use, they become warm, wet, and dark."
