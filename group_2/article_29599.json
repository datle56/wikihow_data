    {
      "title": "Plan the kit.",
      "content": "Plan the kit. We all have different bodies, which need different products to be healthy. For example, if you get sweaty a lot you might need some deodorant. Or if you have chapped flaky lips most of the time, think about adding some Chapstick or hydrating lip gloss. Not all products work for everyone. Just because your friend uses a particular product that helps with skin irritation, doesn't mean it would work for you!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep extra products just in case.",
      "content": "Keep extra products just in case. You may think that some products are unimportant at first glance, but the goal is to be prepared for any situation. Females can get their periods at irregular times, so it's good to be prepared. Plan to include items like a few tampons/pads, fresh pairs of underwear, and pain medication for cramps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a small portable bag.",
      "content": "Get a small portable bag. You don't need a full backpack or a fancy purse for a personal hygiene kit. It has to be small, but not so small that it can't fit everything. It has to be portable and of good quality, so if anything leaks, it won't make a mess outside of the bag. Fancy purses probably aren't a good option. It might get dirty or ruined if hand sanitizer or another liquid gets on it. Backpacks are likely too large and bulky. You'll need a hygiene kit on the go, so it will be difficult to keep carrying a large backpack everywhere. In fact, your mission is for it to be compact and fit within your daily bag. A fanny pack or pencil pouch could be a good choice. Black bags or bags of a neutral color (black, gray, tan) can work well because they are discreet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit your items.",
      "content": "Limit your items. Plan to put a limited number of everything in your hygiene kit. The goal is to have a small amount of anything you may need to be prepared for a particular situation. Don't plan to include unwanted items like leg massage cream or your favorite necklace. Think about things you need and use daily or monthly, not random items. Remember, this is not a random storage container. This kit is specifically used for staying clean and fresh. You can even ask your parents or relatives what they personally think you need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring toiletries for traveling.",
      "content": "Bring toiletries for traveling. Pack a few items like a toothbrush and toothpaste if there aren't any places to buy them nearby. Put a razor in your hygiene kit if you need to shave. If you're boarding a plane, be sure to only pack items that can be in carry-on luggage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep it safe.",
      "content": "Keep it safe. Take care of your hygiene kit so you don't lose it. On any occasion you're going to, keep it in your purse or bag. It should be small enough to fit in there."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add lip balm and/or chapstick.",
      "content": "Add lip balm and/or chapstick. Lips can get dry and flaky any time of the day, so having some extra chapstick or lip balm can be useful. Dry lips can be painful and maybe even disturbing. Having lip balm in your hygiene kits can help you out when it's dry. Limit using flavored or scented lip balms. The chemicals in some scents and added flavorings can irritate your skin or cause allergies, these can dry your lips and make them feel even more chapped."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add pads/tampons.",
      "content": "Add pads/tampons. If it's your day, and you have pads, this can be very helpful. You never know when it comes, and it can be bad if you are not prepared. If you are underaged don't worry too much about this but keep it in mind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include lotion.",
      "content": "Include lotion. If your hands or even your body starts feeling dry, carrying lotion is a good way to go. If you don't already wear makeup, it's a good use for your face. It keeps your skin moisturized for any occasion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a comb/brush.",
      "content": "Add a comb/brush. If you have hair that gets really messy and frizzy most of the time, a mini brush or comb could be very useful for you. A large brush won't be too helpful because it's too large and won't fit the kit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include hand sanitizer.",
      "content": "Include hand sanitizer. Ok, germs are everywhere! So if you don't have access to some soap and water, hand sanitizer can help! Try a hand sanitizer with no alcohol, as they make your hands' dry and stiff."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a razor.",
      "content": "Include a razor. When you start getting a little hair in some parts, a razor on the go could be a good idea. If you like your body hair neat, this is a good recommendation. Small cordless razors are reasonable for a hygiene kit just for men."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put in nail clippers.",
      "content": "Put in nail clippers. When your nails get long and uneven, having some nail clippers by is a great deal. Obviously, it's not something for every occasion, but it is something nice to keep by. The dirt that gets under your nails may contain a lot of germs, so keeping your nails cut is important."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add lotion.",
      "content": "Add lotion. Skin gets dry and de-hydrated half the time, so keep in some lotion to avoid things like that. A small packet of it will be fine so it can fit in the bag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include lip balm.",
      "content": "Include lip balm. Believe it or not, males also need lip balm. Everyone's lips get chapped and having some of that stuff handy can be valuable. If you want to apply lip gloss, go for it! Do what you want to do. Petroleum jelly is a good alternative to lip balm as well. Try avoiding flavored lip balm. Plain is the better way to go for chapped lips."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have some deodorant.",
      "content": "Have some deodorant. It's not fun to get sweaty. It could get uncomfortable. Having deodorant handy is an advantage to put in your kit. It can also leave you feeling fresh and nice-smelling throughout the day, so it's a win-win."
