You can find Iron Ingots in fortresses and dungeons, but it may be easier to just mine some Iron Ore and smelt the Ingots yourself. Iron Ore can be found in layers 1 - 63, and will occur in veins of between 4 - 10 blocks. You are more likely to find it at lower layers. You'll need a Stone Pickaxe or better in order to mine Iron Ore."

[2] X Research source Taking advantage of momentum can help you create a useful and fun Minecart track network. A large drop will allow you to go up and over small inclines, or take a few turns. With a system of multiple drops, you can create a track that can take your Minecart a long distance without any extra help."

[3] X Research source Powered Rails require six Gold Ingots, a Stick, and a Redstone. Place the Gold Ingots in the left and right columns like the Iron Ingots for a regular batch of Rails. Place the Stick in the center, and then place the Redstone in the bottom-middle box. This will produce a stack of six Powered Rails.
