      "title": "Whisk the dough until it thickens.",
      "content": "Whisk the dough until it thickens. It will begin to bubble, then thicken and form a ball after about five minutes of whisking. When it's difficult to move the whisk through the dough, remove it from heat."

      "content": "Microwave on high for a third time. Give it 10 or 15 more seconds, then remove the bowl and check the mixture. The clay should have pulled together to form a sticky, lumpy ball. If the clay still looks gooey, microwave it for another 15 seconds. The finished clay should still be sticky and pliable; if it seems dry, you've overcooked it."

      "title": "Knead the clay.",
      "content": "Knead the clay. After it has cooled for a few moments, oil your hands with cooking oil and knead the clay for about three minutes, until it is smooth and stretchy in texture. Form it into a ball, then pull it apart to test it. The dough is ready when it stretches and forms a peak when you pull off a piece. If it breaks into bits, it's overcooked."

There are many varieties of clay. [1] X Research source Decide whether you want to make pots or sculptures with your clay. The clay that is good for throwing on the wheel might not work for making a big sculpture.
