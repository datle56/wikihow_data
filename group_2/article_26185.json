      "content": "Check the operator's manual. All cars have manual methods of locking and unlocking the doors, but nowadays, the vast majority also have automatic locks. Check the vehicle's instruction manual to determine which locking mechanisms your car has. If you do not have the operator's manual, check inside the car to look for automatic lock buttons. Cars that do not have internal automatic locks probably don't have external automatic locks, either. You can also check the car key to determine whether or not the car has automatic locks. Vehicles equipped with such locks usually have keys with lock buttons on them, but if your car key does not have any buttons on it, you probably won't be able to lock and unlock the car automatically from the outside."

      "title": "Lock the car manually from the inside.",
      "content": "Lock the car manually from the inside. When you get into the car, you can usually lock all of the doors manually. Manual locks can be located at the base of the window frame or on the side of the door, near the handle. Switching the lock to the \"down\" position usually locks it, while flipping it \"up\" typically unlocks it. When using manual locks, you will likely need to lock all doors separately."
    },
    {
      "title": "Internally activate the automatic locks.",
      "content": "Internally activate the automatic locks. Cars equipped with automatic locks have an automatic lock button near the handle of the door and/or in the center console. These buttons are typically labeled with the image of a traditional lock. Pressing the button down toward the closed lock image will lock the car, but pulling the button up toward the open lock image will unlock the car. In most cases, pressing the automatic lock button from any point in the car will lock all of the vehicle's doors."

    {
      "title": "Manually lock the car with the key.",
      "content": "Manually lock the car with the key. As long as the car door has a manual lock on the handle, you should be able to manually lock it from the outside. Most cars only have locks on the two front doors (driver side and passenger side). Some may only have a lock on the front driver side door. Insert the key into the keyhole and turn it toward the trunk. Doing so should lock the car. Turning it toward the hood should unlock the car. Note that in some cars, the car lock might be reversed. If turning toward the trunk does not lock the door, try turning it toward the front of the car."

    {
      "title": "Use the lock button on the key.",
      "content": "Use the lock button on the key. To lock automatic locks from the outside, you'll usually need to use the lock button on the key. In most cases, the lock button will be clearly identified by a closed lock icon. Most keys also have a separate unlock button marked by an open lock icon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lock the car with a keyless remote.",
      "content": "Lock the car with a keyless remote. In some cases, the automatic locks can be operated with a wireless key fob instead of an actual key. Key fob remotes are built into keychains. There might be a \"lock\" icon on the keychain you can use to lock the car, but this isn't always the case. Sometimes, you will need to keep the key fob nearby while standing directly next to the vehicle. There should be an unmarked button on the car handle. Press the button once to unlock the vehicle and twice to lock it. This will only work if the key fob is within a certain distance of the vehicle itself, however, and this distance can vary by manufacturer and model."

[1] X Trustworthy Source National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. government agency responsible for writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Go to source On average, roughly half of the cars stolen in combined urban, suburban, and rural areas were left unlocked at the time of the theft. In addition to locking your car, you should also take extra precautions to discourage potential thieves from targeting your vehicle. Most thieves will opt for an easy target over a hard one, so the less accessible your car is, the less likely it is to be stolen."

      "content": "Protect yourself. Keeping the car locked while you're inside the vehicle can help prevent kidnappings and carjackings. Anyone with a weapon can target you while you're in the car. If a potential threat approaches the car without you noticing, you stand a better chance of noticing in time and driving away unharmed if the criminal is delayed by a locked door. You can also protect yourself from kidnappings and carjackings by traveling on well-lit, busy roads, especially when it's dark outside. Be as aware of your surroundings as possible and keep the car in gear at stop signs and traffic lights so that you can drive away from potential threats quicker."

[2] X Research source You shouldn't even leave the window cracked on a hot day. Depending on the design of the car, it might be possible for a thief to grab onto the lock with a hook or wire and open the car that way."

      "content": "Take your keys. Regardless of whether you lock the car or not, you should remove all sets of car keys from the vehicle and take them with you. [3] X Research source Approximately 13 percent of stolen vehicles have keys at them at the time of the crime. If you do leave a second set of keys in the car, you should hide them in an unusual and hard-to-reach spot. Professional car thieves know just about all of the possible hiding places, however, so it is still better to remove the keys completely than it is to hide them."

      "content": "Set the alarm. If your car comes equipped with an alarm, set the alarm every time you leave the vehicle. Even if your car is equipped with an alarm from the manufacturer, it can be a good idea to install a secondary alarm, as well. More layers of security are better than fewer. Opt for an alarm that activates sirens, horns, and lights for maximum coverage."

Remove visible signs of the key code from your keys to prevent this from happening. Some keys have the number stamped directly on the key, in which case, you should cover it with a sticker or something similar. In other cases, the key code will be on a separate sticker, decal, or tag that can be completely removed from the key. [4] X Research source"

If you need to park your car in an open lot, choose the best possible location for it. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Highway Traffic Safety Administration U.S. government agency responsible for writing and enforcing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Go to source It is much more difficult for thieves to break into both a garage and a car, so using your home garage is strongly recommended. Make sure that both the garage and car are locked to provide maximum security. When parking in an open lot, choose a well-lit area and a crowded lot. Avoid parking in between large vehicles that hide your car, too. More people and improved visibility will both deter potential thieves. When possible, you should also park close to your destination for the sake of your own safety."

      "content": "Make the car difficult to tow. Nowadays, some advanced thieves may attempt to steal your vehicle by towing it away. There are some things you can do to make your car tougher to tow, however. Turn the tires toward the curb when parallel parking. When parking in a driveway or parking lot, turn the tires as far to one side as possible. Back into your driveway if your car is equipped with rear-wheel drive. The rear wheels will lock, making it harder to tow. Cars that only have front-wheel drive should be parked front-end forward. Use the emergency brake when you park your car, as well."

Never leave your car with the key still in the ignition, even if you only need to leave for a minute or so. [6] X Research source Plenty of cars are stolen at ATMs, gas stations, and other similar locations when their owners leave the engine running. Similarly, some cars are stolen from driveways, streets, and parking lots when their owners leave the vehicle running to warm it up on a cold day."

      "title": "Keep several forms of identification.",
      "content": "Keep several forms of identification. At minimum, you should carry the vehicle's registration with you in your purse or wallet instead of keeping it in the car. Keeping the registration in your car can make it easier for a thief to sell it, and it also has your home address on it, giving the thief knowledge of where you live. For the same reasons, you should also keep the title filed away in your house. You should also know your car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), which will make the car easier to identify if it does get stolen. Etch the VIN into all windows and take plenty of pictures of your car with the plate number visible to show police. Another way you can make it easier for police to identify your car is to place identification markers, like dye markers and engravings, around multiple places, including tailgates, spoilers, and under the hood."

      "content": "Hide all valuables. It's best to remove valuables from your car, but if you need to keep something of value in your vehicle temporarily, make sure that it is hidden out of sight. [7] X Research source While valuables don't make your car easier to break into, they can make the car seem more tempting. Do not hide your valuables under a blanket or jacket since this can still seem obvious to many thieves. Don't keep them in your glove compartment or center console, either, since most thieves will think to look there. If you need to leave a valuable in your car, the best place for it is usually the trunk. While you may not necessarily think of it as a \"valuable,\" you should also remove your garage door remote since it can provide thieves with access to your home."
