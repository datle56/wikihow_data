It protects the body by detoxifying hormones, drugs, and any biological molecules not produced in the human body. The liver also synthesizes cholesterol and proteins that might otherwise lead to clotting and inflammation. It stores vitamins, minerals, and sugar while removing bacteria. The liver is involved in several important body functions, so it can become taxed by overuse. It's very important to return an overburdened liver to healthy enzyme levels to ensure all of these processes continue to function normally."

There are a wide variety of diseases that can cause your liver enzyme levels to shoot up: [3] X Research source Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), also known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): fats such as triglycerides and cholesterol accumulate in the liver. Hepatitis viruses: Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E all have different causes. However, each different type of hepatitis infection taxes the liver. Other infections that burden the liver include mononucleosis, adenoviruses, and cytomegalovirus. Tick bites and parasites can cause harmful diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever or toxoplasmosis.

The doctor will also order a Liver Function Test (LFT) analysis of a blood sample. The LFT will test for the levels of various liver enzymes and proteins. Your doctor will use that information to aid in diagnosis. Some of these enzyme tests include: [5] X Research source AST (Aspartate aminotransferase): AST levels are analyzed to determine the likelihood of acute or chronic hepatitis. [6] X Research source ALT (Alanine aminotransferase): ALT is used to detect and follow the progress of hepatitis and liver injury. [7] X Research source High levels are found in those with alcoholism, viral hepatitis, and diabetes. The ratio between AST/ALT levels is often used to tell if liver disease is due to infection, inflammation, or alcohol use. [8] X Research source ALP (Alkaline phosphatase): Can help diagnose bone disease, liver disease and gallbladder disorders. [9] X Research source GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase): With ALP, can be used to distinguish between liver and bone disease. GGT is also useful to help determine alcohol history; it is increased in about 75% of chronic alcoholics. [10] X Research source LD (Lactic dehydrogenase): LD (sometimes known as LDH) is used along with the other LFT values to monitor treatment of liver and other disorders. High levels are seen in various liver diseases, anemias, kidney disease, and infections. [11] X Research source"

Green tea: Reduces the risk of liver disease, but in some people, it can increase liver problems. The best course is to speak to your physician for advice regarding using green tea. In general, two to four cups of green tea has been shown to reduce the risk of liver disease."

The most common dose is 100 mg three times a day. [30] X Research source Podymova S. D., Davletshina I. V.

The most common dose to support the liver is 200–250 mg twice daily. ALA may interact with diabetes medications, so consult your physician regarding the best dose. There have been rare cases where very high doses of NAC increased liver enzymes. [32] X Research source Badawy, A. H., Abdel Aal, S. F., and Samour, S. A.
