      "content": "Dry brush your skin every day before you shower. Use a bath brush with natural, stiff bristles. A long handle helps you get to those hard-to-reach places. Start with your feet and ankles and move up your body, making circular motions. Lighten the pressure as needed — some parts of your skin will be more sensitive than others. And never brush over damaged or broken skin. Not only will it be painful, but you could make the problem worse. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Shower immediately after you dry brush to get rid of all the flaky skin you exfoliated from your body. Dry brushing is like a massage in that it improves your circulation. Over time, it will also improve the overall quality of your skin. The skin on your face might be too sensitive to use a brush comfortably. Try a dry washcloth instead — it's gentler but produces the same results."

      "content": "Get in 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise most days. At least 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity, such as going for a brisk walk, will significantly improve your blood circulation. While this does improve your overall circulation, it translates to increased blood flow to your face as well. [7] X Trustworthy Source Journals of the American Heart Association Open Access, peer-reviewed journals focusing on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, as well as related scientific research. Go to source It's not as though you have to go to the gym for a half-hour every day. Activity at work or throughout your daily life also counts — just as long as you keep moving. Intermittent activity throughout the day has the same benefit as a half-hour dedicated exclusively to exercise. If you have a relatively sedentary job, try to get up and move around every 15 or 20 minutes, even if it's just to walk around the room a few times or do jumping jacks in place."

You might've heard you're supposed to drink 8 glasses of water a day, but this advice isn't entirely accurate. To play it safe, pay attention to the color of your urine — if it's clear or pale, that means you're getting enough water. If it's darker, you should be drinking more. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source If you're active or outside in the heat and you're sweating, you'll likely need more water. The same goes if you're drinking alcohol or caffeine, both of which are dehydrating. While you also get water from the food you eat, it's generally healthier and better for your body to simply drink water rather than relying on food or other beverages."

If your skin is naturally dry, you might get more benefit from a massage oil than from regular moisturizer. Use a base (or carrier) oil, such as sunflower or coconut oil.

[11] X Research source If your skin is prone to breakouts, you might want to stay away from oils. Just use a lightweight moisturizer to keep from damaging your skin.

If you regularly see a facialist or dermatologist, you might also ask them if they have a specific product they'd recommend. Massage rollers provide more even pressure on your skin than just your fingers or hands would, which makes them more efficient for massage. Heated rollers can also widen the blood vessels in your face, making it easier for blood to flow to your skin."
