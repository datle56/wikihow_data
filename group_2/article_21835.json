      "content": "Stand the door up in the existing frame. Lift the door up and fit it into its frame as best as you can. Make sure the bottom of the door sits flat and level on the ground so you can make an accurate measurement later on. If the door sits crooked, put shims underneath the sides until it is level. [1] X Research source If the door is heavy, have a partner help you lift the door."

      "title": "Measure the distance between the top of the door jamb and the top of the door.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between the top of the door jamb and the top of the door. Use a tape measure to find the distance between the top of the door frame and the top of your door. Check your measurement in 3 different places across the top of the frame to make sure the distance is the same. [2] X Research source If the measurements are not the same in each of the 3 places, use 40-60-grit sandpaper to smooth out the surface."

    {
      "title": "Cut the bottom of the door using the measurement you took.",
      "content": "Cut the bottom of the door using the measurement you took. First, add 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) to the distance between the top of the door and the door jamb. Then, measure that distance up from the bottom of the door and mark it, putting a layer of tape above the mark so the wood doesn’t splinter when you saw it. Next, set your door across 2 saw horses, and use clamps to secure the door in place. Finally, use a circular saw to cut off the bottom portion of the door along the mark you made. [3] X Research source For example, if you measured 1 1 ⁄ 4 in (3.2 cm) on the top of your door, cut off 1 3 ⁄ 4 in (4.4 cm) from the bottom of the door. Wear safety glasses while working with your circular saw. If the difference in height is less than 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm), use a 40-60-grit sandpaper or a planer. Use a finish saw blade with teeth packed close together to get a smooth cut without splintering."

      "title": "Check the measurements on the sides of the door.",
      "content": "Check the measurements on the sides of the door. Hold the door in its frame so it’s pressed against the hinge side, and check how it fits. Make sure there’s at least 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) of space between each side of the door and the frame. If the door doesn’t fit, take 3 measurements along 1 side of the door. [4] X Research source If the door fits well, you can skip to attaching the hinges. Check the width measurement from the door jamb to ensure that it's accurate."

      "title": "Sand or plane the sides of the door if you need to.",
      "content": "Sand or plane the sides of the door if you need to. Remove an equal distance from each side of the door. Use a 40- or 60-grit sandpaper to shave down the sides of the door until it fits in the frame. To remove more than 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm), use a planer to scrape the wood off. [5] X Research source For example, if your door is 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) too wide, then remove 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from each side."

Position wooden wedges underneath the door so you have at least 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) between each side and the frame. [6] X Research source If you don’t have wedges, you can use 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) shims instead."

Make sure to mark the tops and bottoms of all 3 hinges so you know exactly where you need to make the mortises, or hinge wells, on your door. [7] X Research source Make sure the side of the door with the knob is on the opposite side as the hinges."

Hold your hinges on the side of the door so they’re in between your marks. Trace around your hinge to get the correct shape for your mortises. Hold the edge of your hinge on the front of your door and mark the depth. [8] X Research source Draw your pencil marks lightly so you can easily erase them."

Pound the end of the chisel lightly with a hammer to make a small cut for your mortise. Continue making cuts 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) apart across the length of each mortise. [10] X Research source Make sure to only chisel to the depth of your hinge, or else you’ll remove too much wood. Sharpen your chisel so you don’t accidentally crack the wood."
