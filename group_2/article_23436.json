      "content": "Check the cat’s general alertness. If you notice that your cat is acting out of the ordinary, you need to examine the animal's general health. If the cat has lost consciousness, check the animal’s breathing. Check whether the cat responds to the sound of your voice. Note any shaking or spasms. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch for signs of depression.",
      "content": "Watch for signs of depression. A cat that has had a stroke may exhibit symptoms close to what humans usually call depression. The cat may seem unusually quiet and stop responding in the usual ways. This behavior may occur because the cat may feel disoriented, woozy, nauseous, and/or suffer from a thumping headache.

      "title": "Look for an abnormal head tilt.",
      "content": "Look for an abnormal head tilt. You may notice that the cat holds its head at a strange angle with one ear lower than the other. He may exhibit this symptom as a tilting, turning, or twisting of the head. If due to a stroke, the symptom usually means pressure on a specific part of the brain. [5] X Research source This symptom may also signify another problem, such as vestibular disease, which leads to damage of the vestibular apparatus in the cat’s inner ear. Vestibular disease affects the cat’s sense of balance and orientation in a manner similar to signs of stroke. The symptom is cause for concern and an immediate trip to the veterinarian regardless whether a stroke or vestibular disease causes it. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Watch for unstable walking or circling.",
      "content": "Watch for unstable walking or circling. You may notice that your cat cannot walk in a straight line. The cat might stagger as if drunk, fall to one side, or walk in circles. Again, when caused by a stroke, this symptom usually results from pressure on a portion of the brain. [7] X Research source These symptoms may also present as weakness on one side of the body or postural defects. The cat might measure steps wrong or show signs of weakness in all legs as well. [8] X Research source As with other symptoms due to pressure on the cat’s brain, unstable walking and/or circling can also be signs of vestibular disease. If your cat has tremors or moves its limbs wildly and rhythmically, this likely means a seizure. In some cases, you may not see the actual seizures. You may come across the disoriented cat afterward. This is called a post octal phase of a seizure and may last for a few minutes to a few hours. [9] X Research source Though an isolated seizure is less cause for immediate concern, you should still take the cat to the veterinarian as soon as possible."

      "title": "Examine the cat’s eyes.",
      "content": "Examine the cat’s eyes. [10] X Expert Source Natalie Punt, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 19 August 2021. Look closely at your cat's eyes. If he has had a stroke, his pupils may be different-sized or his eyes may flick from side to side. This is called nystagmus and it is due to a lack of blood supply to the nerves that feed the eyes. [11] X Research source If your cat's pupils are unequal in size, the third eyelids are prominent, and if there is a head tilt, then this is more indicative of vestibular disease than a stroke. As a side effect of the nystagmus, the cat may be nauseous from motion sickness."

[12] X Research source Clinical Medicine in the Dog and Cat. Schaer. Publisher: Manson. Even in cases where the blindness isn’t from a stroke, the symptom is a telltale sign of high blood pressure in a cat, which often precedes a stroke.

      "content": "Do not look too hard for symptoms seen in strokes in humans. The most classic signs of stroke in humans include partial paralysis and a droop to one side of the face. Cats do not experience strokes the same way humans do. These symptoms tend not to present themselves when a cat has a stroke. [14] X Research source Clinical Medicine in the Dog and Cat. Schaer.

    {
      "title": "Note how quickly the symptoms exhibited themselves.",
      "content": "Note how quickly the symptoms exhibited themselves. Since the loss of blood supply to the part of the brain happens quickly, the effects of a stroke happen suddenly as well. If your cat develops worsening balance issues over several weeks, for instance, then a stroke is not the likely cause. However, you should still take your cat to the veterinarian for any recurring or worsening symptoms."

    {
      "title": "Track how long the symptoms last.",
      "content": "Track how long the symptoms last. Stroke symptoms usually last at least twenty-four hours in a cat. You should take your cat to the veterinarian as soon as you observe symptoms, but that might not always be possible. Like humans, cats can have a mini-stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This means that the symptoms may begin to subside after a day; however, you should still take your cat to the veterinarian even if symptoms decrease in severity. [15] X Research source These temporary signs are a strong indication that there is a problem requiring further medical investigation to prevent the cat from having a full-blown stroke in the near future."

      "title": "Examine your cat’s medical history.",
      "content": "Examine your cat’s medical history. Though not an immediate, observable sign, strokes are more likely in cats when they have underlying health conditions. [16] X Research source Clinical Medicine in the Dog and Cat. Schaer. Publisher: Manson. If you regularly take your cat to the veterinarian, look at your cat’s records. If the veterinarian has previously diagnosed your cat with kidney disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, or overactive thyroid glands, then the chance of a stroke is much higher."

      "title": "Take the cat to the veterinarian immediately.",
      "content": "Take the cat to the veterinarian immediately. The sooner the cat sees a veterinarian, the better care the animal will receive, meaning a better chance for recovery. Strokes in cats are not always as devastating to the animal as strokes tend to be in humans; however, the event is still serious and requires immediate attention. [17] X Research source You may want to call ahead as you place the cat in its carrier to tell the veterinarian the symptoms you’ve seen as well. If it is at night, you may need to take him to the emergency veterinary hospital."

      "title": "Cooperate with the veterinarian.",
      "content": "Cooperate with the veterinarian. Your vet will ask you some questions to help determine a course of action. They will ask questions about many things involving your cat's behavior, so make sure you pay close attention to your cat. They will ask if your cat could have ingested anything like a plant, a medication, or a poison to cause the symptoms. They might also ask if there was any known trauma like a fall prior to the symptoms. They will ask about any changes in his water or food intake. They will also likely ask if there has been any vomiting, diarrhea, or general lethargy. You will need to know if your cat has had his rabies vaccination recently as well."

    {
      "title": "Get tests.",
      "content": "Get tests. Your veterinarian may order a blood panel, urinalysis, x-rays, or an ultrasound. These tests can help determining stroke or the underlying conditions that often accompany a stroke in cats (discussed in Part 1). If your vet thinks there might be a serious neurological problem, a veterinarian specializing in neurology may be needed for a consult. The specialist may ask for additional tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, which can identify a blood clot or area of damage to the brain. These test are done for animals in a similar way to how they are done for humans."

      "content": "Care for your cat. In many cases, your cat’s symptoms may resolve after a few days of TLC at home. In some cases, the cat may require hospitalization with the veterinarian. Neurological outcomes can be very difficult to determine. You and your veterinarian will need time to tell exactly what the long lasting effects or conditions might be. If your cat has motion sickness as a symptom, a medication such as Cerenia is available to manage that. If your cat’s appetite is down, there may be options that increase the appetite such as Mirtazapine. If your cat is having seizures, your veterinarian will likely discuss medical management with anti-seizure medications such as phenobarbital. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Research possible outcomes. If the symptoms were actually vestibular disease, the cat may spontaneously recover in a few days. In other situations, the cat may have a sustained head tilt. That may be the only lasting effect while he is otherwise fine. Other cats may continue to have some balance problems. Since the brain is complicated, the full outcome of a neurological event cannot be completely predicted. It may be tough to watch your pet stumble around.

      "content": "Help the cat with eating and other functions if necessary. While recovering, you may need to help the cat eat, drink, or go to the litter box. This will depend on the severity of the condition. You may need to pick them up and carry him to the food bowl, to the water dish, or to the litter box. Watch for signs that he is hungry or needs to go to the litter box, such as meowing or general discontent. It will take time to know if this will be a temporary or a permanent necessity for your cat."
