If she’s enthusiastically texting you back within a few minutes, feel free to reciprocate. If she waits a bit longer to text you back, give her the same consideration. However, it’s important to note that waiting a while to text back when you have time to text back sooner can be considered “ playing mind games ” and could ultimately hurt the blossoming relationship more than it could help it. Be polite, let her know if you’re busy and can’t chat, and respect her when she does the same. The right girl will make texting her feel like a breeze. You got this!"
