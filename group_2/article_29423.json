Here is what you'll need to make a mocha coffee drink using brewed coffee: [1] X Research source 8 ounces freshly brewed coffee (or instant) 1/2 cup (4 ounces) milk 1 tablespoon (15 g) cocoa powder 1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water or warm milk (milk makes the mocha richer and creamy) Sugar (optional) Whipped cream and cocoa (optional, for topping)"

      "content": "Brew as much coffee as you want. To be closer to authentic, you'll want to use double-strength, dark-roasted coffee. And you could use instant coffee if you're in a pinch, but brewed coffee is just so much better. [2] X Research source Coffee reaches \"double-strength\" when it's around 4 tablespoons (60 g) of coffee grinds to 6 ounces of water."

      "content": "Steam some milk or heat it on the stovetop or in the microwave. How much? Well, how big is your mug? 1/3 to 1/2 cup (3 to 4 ounces) is usually plenty. You want the milk between 140 and 160°F (60 - 70°C). Any hotter than that and the milk burns, losing its flavor."

      "title": "Fill your mug with heated milk.",
      "content": "Fill your mug with heated milk. If there's any foam, be sure to hold it back with a spoon, so it layers above the mocha on top. If you like a really, really sweet mocha, add a teaspoon of sugar to your drink before you top it with foam."

      "content": "Steam 1/2 cup of milk. If you have a steamer, of course. If you don't, you can just add your milk straight to your espresso and heat in the microwave or throw the milk onto the stovetop and heat to 160°F (70°C). But if you have an espresso machine, you probably have a steamer! Make sure the tip of your steamer isn't too near the bottom or too near the top of your milk. You want it not too be too bubbly and aerated, but also not burned and over-steamed. It should only take about 15 seconds, and if you have a thermometer, stop around 160°F (70°C). Is your mug Central Perk-style large? Then you may want closer to 3/4 of a cup."

You want that stuff to go on top, after the milk and chocolate have combined. Once all the milk has gone into your mug, spoon out the foam so it rests uniformly on top, putting the proverbial icing on the cake."
