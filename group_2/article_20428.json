      "title": "Graduate with a degree",
      "content": "Graduate with a degree in a field related to the job you want to make your application stand out. While it's not necessary to graduate with a degree in order to get a job at Google, it does help give you needed knowledge and skills. Find a program in the field you wish to study and put in the time and effort to earn a degree if desired. [1] X Research source For example, if you're hoping to land a software engineering role, a degree in Computer Science or something similar is useful. Do a quick online search to find colleges near you with the program you'd like to study. If you can't earn your degree full-time, consider studying part-time or online."

      "title": "Get professional experience related to the position.",
      "content": "Get professional experience related to the position. Real-world experience will make your application stand out. Gain as much experience as possible in the field that you want to work in. You could volunteer or take a part-time position at a marketing firm, for instance, if you want to become a part of Google's marketing team. Think about projects you completed in college or experience from past jobs that are relevant to the position you are applying for as well. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re applying for an engineering job, sharpen your coding skills as much as possible. Google employers like it when you have a record of completing open-source projects and other helpful experience related to the position you’re applying for."

      "title": "Be an emergent leader by solving problems.",
      "content": "Be an emergent leader by solving problems. Google recruiters want their employees to be leaders who step in when they see a problem that needs solving. However, they also think it’s super important to know when to step back when you’re not needed anymore. Think about times when you demonstrated this type of leadership, and be prepared to talk about it. [3] X Research source Think about a role you had where you lead others. How did you use decision-making and communication skills to help them get moving? These are the kinds of questions you’ll be asked by Google. Even if you weren’t put in a position of power, give examples of times when you stepped up and helped the team succeed."

    {
      "title": "Have intellectual humility, or “Googleyness.”",
      "content": "Have intellectual humility, or “Googleyness.” To be hired at Google, they want you to have what they call Googleyness, which is a combination of character traits. This includes things like how well you’re able to work as a team, help others, and push yourself out of your comfort zone. Employers want potential candidates to stand up for their thoughts and opinions while also being open to new information. [4] X Research source Being humble by admitting that you’re wrong is one of their most valued qualities."

    {
      "title": "Enjoy passions outside of work.",
      "content": "Enjoy passions outside of work. Google likes well-rounded individuals. If you’re only focused on your job and have no other hobbies or interests, this might make it more difficult to land the job. Have other things you like to do, such as exploring nature, learning different languages, or inventing new gadgets. [5] X Research source Mention your passions in your cover letter if they’re related to the job you’re applying for, or talk about your hobbies or interests in an interview if you’re given one."

    {
      "title": "Show a strong learning ability.",
      "content": "Show a strong learning ability. This doesn’t just mean that you’re super intelligent, but that you absorb information very quickly. Google recruiters look for people who have a love of learning and a fast mental processing speed. [6] X Research source This kind of characteristic might be tested in an interview by asking you open-ended questions. Be prepared to explain your reasoning and use data to support your decision."
    },
    {
      "title": "Demonstrate expertise in your chosen job area.",
      "content": "Demonstrate expertise in your chosen job area. Google encourages people to only apply to jobs that they feel they could really excel in and know a lot about the work they’d be doing. If you’re applying for a programming role, it’s important that you know at least 1 programming language very well, such as C++, Java, Python, or Go. [7] X Research source If you’re applying for a sales position, you would want to know a lot about marketing and product knowledge. Knowledge of coding, algorithms, and data structures are all important skills for technical positions. While having a degree in your chosen field is helpful, Google puts more emphasis on experience than being a college graduate."

      "content": "Reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn to get your foot in the door. This is a great way to try to form a connection with a Google recruiter, and it has the potential to lead to an interview. Type \"Google recruiter\" into the search bar on LinkedIn to find people you can message. [8] X Research source Update your LinkedIn profile so it shows all your best skills. Reaching out through LinkedIn shows that you’re serious about connecting with someone and really want the job. Send them a message such as, “Hello, I'm interested in the Software Engineering role at Google and was wondering if you could answer 1 or 2 of my questions.”"

      "title": "Update your resume",
      "content": "Update your resume so it shows off your skills and talents. Edit your resume so it reflects the skills and experience needed for the specific job. Google loves project-based experience, so make sure any projects you’ve worked on are explained on your resume. Keep your resume short—1 page is long enough. [9] X Research source Many Google jobs don’t require you to write a cover letter because they believe they get an accurate picture of your skills and experience through your resume and application questions, though you can write one if you’d like. Add any leadership roles you had to your resume as well. If you’ve been out of school for several years, it’s not necessary to put your GPA on your resume, especially if it’s not super high."

Once you’re finished and submit the application, you’ll receive an automated email telling you you’ve applied for the position. You’ll only hear from Google if the company believes you’re a good fit. Be patient; Google receives lots of applications, so it might take them time to sift through them."

      "content": "Prepare for an interview by practicing questions. If you’re asked to do an interview, this means the recruiters think your skills might line up with the job and they want to get to know more about you. Practice answering questions about how you solve problems and make decisions, as well as more personal or creative questions. [10] X Research source For example, if you're applying for a job as a Technical Program Manager, you might be asked a question like, \"What methodology do you use in your project management?\" Personal questions might include what you like to do in your spare time, what your dream job is, or what animal you would be. Go online and type \"Google interview questions\" into the search bar to find potential interview questions for your specific job. Make a list of any questions you have about the role so you can ask them during the interview."

Answer their questions about the qualities that Google looks for, like cognitive ability, leadership, expertise in your field, and Googleyness. [12] X Research source You may have 2-3 different rounds of in-person interviews throughout the whole process. Ask questions during these interviews about both the specific job and the Google atmosphere. For example, if you're applying for a Field Sales Representative job, you might talk about the best ways to market and sell a product."

      "title": "Complete projects or tests to demonstrate your skills.",
      "content": "Complete projects or tests to demonstrate your skills. If the interviewers like you, you'll be asked to complete additional tasks. These include things like coding, sales pitches, or presentations relating to your specific field. For instance, you might be asked to write lines of code if you’re applying for a software engineering role. These projects or tests may take many hours, so don’t be discouraged if you find the process becoming tiring. A sales project might entail doing a mock sale and trying to get the interviewer interested in a product."
