      "content": "Spread the flour in a thin layer on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Preheat your oven to 400 °F (204 °C) and spread a piece of parchment paper across a baking sheet. Measure out the flour you want to heat treat and use a spatula to spread it out in an even layer on the baking sheet. To ensure the flour heats through, only use enough to make a 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) layer across the baking sheet. [1] X Research source Baking tip: Use a little more flour than you’ll need for your recipe. Even with parchment paper, some of the flour might stick to the bottom of the pan. Don’t try to scrape off any of the flour that’s stuck to the pan—it will be clumpy and may taste burnt. [2] X Research source"

If you use more than the recipe calls for, store it in an airtight container until you need it. Just note that if you use a lot of flour, you might need to heat it a little longer to bring it up to temperature.

After you stir, use an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature of the flour. Keep microwaving in 30-second intervals until the thermometer reads 165 °F (74 °C). [6] X Research source Safety tip: Test the temperature of the flour in several places—if any readings show less than 165 °F (74 °C), put the flour back in for another 30 seconds."

After about 3 minutes, take the pan off the element, stir the flour again, and check the temperature with an instant-read thermometer . If every reading is at least 165 °F (74 °C), let the flour cool, then use it. [7] X Research source"
