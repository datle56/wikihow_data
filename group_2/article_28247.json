[1] X Research source If you are in dryer conditions, the moist subsoil may be slightly deeper. Dig until you find it. Do not dig the hole/holes in the shade. This process needs direct sunlight to work correctly. Look around and make sure that shade won't move over your solar still before evening arrives."
