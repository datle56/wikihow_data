      "content": "Choose a weave that you like. If you’re just getting started on making chainmail, go for an easier weave. You can pick from the European 4 in 1, the European 6 in 1, the Box Chain, the Full Persian, the Half Persian, or Butted chainmail. [1] X Research source As you get better at making chainmail, you can move onto tougher weaves."

      "title": "Pick out wire or pre-made rings.",
      "content": "Pick out wire or pre-made rings. Now you can decide whether you will make your own rings from wire or purchase pre-made wire rings. Rings are available in a variety of combinations of inside diameters (distance between the inside edges of the ring--abbreviated to ID) and gauges (wire thickness, or wire diameter [abbreviated WD]). The relationship between these two numbers, using the formula ID/WD, is the aspect ratio (abbreviated AR). [2] X Research source Bigger rings will cover an area with fewer rings and less weight, but the texture will be coarser, regardless of AR. Rings with a larger AR will not be as strong as smaller AR rings of the same material, regardless of the material. Wire of a thicker gauge will be more durable, but also weigh more and be harder to work with. Materials for rings are not limited to plain iron or steel. You can also get rings in galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, inconel, niobium, silver, gold, and rubber. You can also get rings in a variety of colors and create many different inlays with them. An easy source of wire to get started is coat hangers. They are fairly easy to bend. The downside is that you have to cut your own rings and the result is not very strong. You can also find wire in the Fencing section of the hardware store."

      "title": "Gather your pliers and a metal rod.",
      "content": "Gather your pliers and a metal rod. If you aren’t working about marring or scratching the rings, get 2 pairs of needle nose pliers with teeth. If you want to keep the rings pristine, get some needle nose pliers without teeth. You should also grab a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) metal or wooden dowel. [3] X Research source If you’re working with super thin or small wire (like for jewelry), you can use tweezers instead of pliers. Your metal or wooden rod can be almost anything, as long as it’s about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) in diameter."

    {
      "title": "Wind the wire firmly around a rod.",
      "content": "Wind the wire firmly around a rod. Place the end of your wire on your metal or wooden rod and slowly wind it up. The goal here is to get as many rings as possible that are even in size and shape, so try to be consistent with your winding. [4] X Research source You may need to control one or both ends with pliers. Aim for even, consistent loops and try to avoid putting tight kinks in the wire. If the wire came in a coil or spool, wind with the curvature that the wire already has. For making large quantities, make a small hole in the rod to fasten the wire and use a drill to rotate the rod. If you do this, wear heavy gloves to protect your hands."

    {
      "title": "Cut the rings out with wire cutters.",
      "content": "Cut the rings out with wire cutters. Slide your spool of wire off the rod and carry it over to a workbench or table. Cut off the end of the wire that isn’t in a full ring, then start carefully snipping rings out of the spool. Aim for full, 360 degree rings that are cut evenly. Try to hold your wire cutters at a slight angle so they’re easier to cut. [5] X Research source If you’re worried about the rings flying everywhere, put on eye protection. Keep all the rings that you’re cutting out in the same place."

Once they’re all threaded, close the fifth ring using your needle nose pliers. [6] X Research source To open and close the rings, always twist the ends of the ring away from each other. If you pull them straight away from each other, your ring won’t be round anymore. This is the first chain in your chainmail."

It looks a little silly right now, but that’s only because you haven’t added the rest of your pattern. [7] X Research source It’s very important to be working on a flat surface so you can spread out your chainmail as you go."

Keep opening up 1 ring and attaching 2 rings to it, then slipping it onto the bottom 2 rings of your last weave. When you’re done, make sure your pattern is laid out flat on the table and that everything repeats evenly. [10] X Research source The length of the strip depends on what you’re making with the chainmail. For clothing, you’ll want a large strip; for jewelry or small items, you can use your discretion."

If you’re going for jewelry, 1 or 2 rows might be enough. Keep adding rows of chainmail until you’ve got enough of them to make your project. [13] X Research source If you want to make a chainmail shirt, you’ll need to make an entire new piece of chainmail for the back of the shirt too. Then, you can connect them with rings down either side."

To start your box chain, make a strip of chainmail in the European 4 in 1 style just slightly longer than you’d like your box chain weave to be. [14] X Research source This means that you’ll need to wind the wire and use wire cutters to create loops, then attach them together 3 rings at a time. The box chain is great for making jewelry, but not so great for shirts or armor."

You can close the open ring with needle nose pliers when you’re done. [16] X Research source It’s super important to thread the new ring through both the 2 that you flipped up and the 2 behind it.

Then, measure the length from your waist up to your armpits. Create a European 4 in 1 weave that spans the length and width of your torso from your armpits down, then add a longer strip on either side to make sleeves. [18] X Research source The most time-consuming part of making a chainmail shirt is attaching all of the loops, since you need so many of them.

Once you complete your strip (try to make it about 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) long), simply attach a keyring to one end and a carabiner to the other. Now you have a cute way to show off your chainmail creation while giving it a function as well. [19] X Research source Try using alternating ring colors, like blue and silver, to make your keyring more interesting."
