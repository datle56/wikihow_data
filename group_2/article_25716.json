      "content": "Start with vowel sounds. Bahasa Indonesia has 5 vowels, the same as in English. However, in Bahasa Indonesia, vowels typically only make one sound. This differs from English, in which vowels can be either long or short. [2] X Research source The letter \"a\" makes an \"ah\" sound like the \"a\" in the English word \"father.\" The letter \"e\" makes an \"eh\" sound similar to the \"e\" in the English word \"let,\" but slightly more rounded. Think of combining the \"eh\" sound with the \"a\" sound in the English word \"late.\" The letter \"i\" makes an \"ee\" sound like the \"ee\" in the English word \"feet.\" The letter \"o\" makes an \"oh\" sound similar to the \"oe\" in the English word \"toe,\" but more rounded. Think of combining the \"oh\" sound with the \"aw\" sound in the English word \"saw.\" The letter \"u\" makes an \"oo\" sound like the \"oo\" in the English word \"boot.\""

      "content": "Blend the vowel sounds in diphthongs. Bahasa Indonesia also has 3 diphthongs, which are a combination of 2 vowels blended together to produce a different sound than the 2 letters would make separately. These diphthongs always have the same sound. The diphthong \"ai\" sounds like the \"ie\" in the English word \"tie.\" The diphthong \"au\" sounds like the \"ow\" in the English word \"how.\" The diphthong \"oi\" sounds like the \"oy\" in the English word \"boy.\""

      "title": "Use most of the same consonant sounds you would in English.",
      "content": "Use most of the same consonant sounds you would in English. Bahasa Indonesia uses the same alphabet as English, and most of the consonants are pronounced the same way. However, some are more limited than their English counterparts. There are also a few consonants that are pronounced differently, so if you're learning Bahasa Indonesia, you'll need to practice those. The letter \"g\" is pronounced like the hard \"g\" in the English word \"good.\" However, it never has a soft sound, like the \"g\" in the English word \"giant.\" The letter \"s\" is pronounced like the \"s\" in the English word \"see.\" It never has a softer \"z\" sound, like the \"s\" in the English word \"boys.\" The letter \"y\" always has a hard consonant sound, as in the English word \"yell.\" The letters \"k,\" \"p,\" and \"t,\" aren't aspirated (said with the exhalation of a short puff of air), as in the English words \"kill,\" \"put,\" and \"tap.\" Rather, they always sound like \"skate,\" \"spot,\" and \"stop.\""

    {
      "title": "Practice compound consonants.",
      "content": "Practice compound consonants. Bahasa Indonesia has 4 compound consonants, also known as \"digraphs.\" With these consonant blends, the 2 consonant sounds combine to produce a different sound than the 2 letters might if they appeared in a word separately. As with diphthongs, when you see any other 2 consonants together in a Bahasa Indonesia word, pronounce each letter separately rather than blending them together. [3] X Research source The digraph \"ng\" sounds like the \"ng\" at the end of the English word \"sing.\" This digraph also appears at the beginning of words, which is a sound that can be difficult for native speakers of Western languages, although it's common in other Asian languages. The digraph \"ny\" sounds like the \"ny\" in the English word \"canyon.\" The digraph \"sy\" sounds like the \"sh\" in the English word \"shoe.\" It is only used in words of Arabic origin. The digraph \"kh\" sounds like the \"ch\" in the Scottish word \"loch.\" It is only used in words of Arabic origin."

      "content": "Sound out most words exactly as they're spelled. Bahasa Indonesia is a relatively easy language to learn because it is a phonetic language, meaning the words are pronounced exactly as they're spelled. Once you know how to pronounce the alphabet, you can sound out words that you see in print, even if you don't quite understand what they mean. [4] X Research source One exception to the phonetic rule is the word \"tahu.\" The word is either a verb meaning \"to know\" or a noun meaning \"tofu.\" As a verb, the \"h\" is silent and you pronounce the word similar to the word \"tao.\" If the word means \"tofu,\" you pronounce it phonetically: \"tah-hoo.\" Fortunately, when reading Bahasa Indonesia, you can usually tell from the context which word is meant."

[8] X Research source To ask the other person their name, say \"Siapa nama Anda?\" While this is the formal version of the question, that's typically the version you'd use if you were meeting someone for the first time.

After all, most people don't spend their day talking about furniture and other household items.

Once you've found the Indonesian word, do an image search online for that word. Save a few images that stick out to you and use them to create flashcards.

Unlike most languages, Bahasa Indonesia doesn't have a lot of complex grammar rules that you might be familiar with from other languages, including English and European languages. This lack of rules can make the language a lot easier to pick up. Grammar rules you don't have to worry about include: [16] X Research source No gender: Unlike in many European languages, such as Spanish or French, Indonesian nouns do not have a gender, so you don't have to worry about whether something is either male or female. No plurals: Nouns don't change their form to indicate that they're plural. Rather, you figure out whether a noun is singular or plural from the context of the sentence. No conjugations: Verbs do not change form in Bahasa Indonesia. You don't have to worry about the verb agreeing with the subject, because the verb form is always the same regardless of the identity or number of the subject (and remember, nouns don't have a plural form). No tenses: Technically speaking, verbs don't change their form to indicate past, present, or future tense. Rather, you simply add a single word in front of the verb to indicate past or future tense. For example, using the verb \"berenang\" (swim), you could say \"Saya akan berenang\" (I will swim) or \"Saya berenang\" (I swam; literally \"I already swim\"). [17] X Research source"

You may also be able to order books in Bahasa Indonesia (or download eBooks) from your favorite online retailer. Since Bahasa Indonesia is a phonetic language, you should have no trouble sounding out the words. However, it's a good idea to keep a dictionary at hand so you can look up the definitions of words that you don't know. Keep in mind that the language you read in books and articles can be very different from the casual Indonesian spoken by native speakers. Imitating the written word in speech can make you sound stiff and formal (although people will still generally understand you)."

For this reason, if you truly want to learn how to communicate in Bahasa Indonesia, you need to find someone who speaks the language and learn from them. Look for local Indonesian groups or search online for a language exchange partner. [18] X Research source Keep in mind that many Indonesians don't speak Bahasa Indonesia, and many more who do speak it as a second or third language. It can be more difficult to find people who speak Bahasa Indonesia as a first language. Sometimes it's best if you let a native speaker do most of the talking.

While you'll likely only learn a few words this way, it helps you get in the habit of thinking in Indonesian rather than in your native language. When you're watching TV or a movie, turn on Indonesian subtitles if they're available. Read and pay attention to the subtitles as you're listening in your native language. Cook an Indonesian dish for dinner from a recipe written in Bahasa Indonesia.
