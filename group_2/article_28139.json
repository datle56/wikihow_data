      "title": "Heat 1 tbsp (14.2 g) of butter on low in a cast iron or non-stick skillet.",
      "content": "Heat 1 tbsp (14.2 g) of butter on low in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. Choose a skillet large enough to fit 2 cracked eggs so that they won't touch in the pan. Place the skillet on the burner with the butter in the pan, and turn on the burner to heat the butter. [1] X Research source If your pan isn't non-stick, such as a carbon steel pan, you may need to spray it lightly with a non-stick spray before adding the butter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tilt the pan to distribute the melted butter over the bottom.",
      "content": "Tilt the pan to distribute the melted butter over the bottom. The butter helps to fry the bottom of the eggs quickly and maintain their shape. Make sure the butter is covering almost as much of the surface of the bottom of the pan as possible. [2] X Research source If you don't have butter, you can use lard, olive oil, or bacon fat to make your eggs, because each will spread to coat the bottom of the pan."
    },
    {
      "title": "Break 1 egg",
      "content": "Break 1 egg gently into the pan, keeping the yolk intact. Once the butter is simmering, hold the egg about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) over the frying pan as you break it, and let it gently drop into the bottom of the hot pan. The egg whites will begin to cook immediately. [3] X Research source If you have trouble cracking eggs, crack each one into a bowl, check for shell fragments, and then carefully pour the egg into the pan."
    },
    {
      "title": "Crack another egg into the pan so that the whites don't touch.",
      "content": "Crack another egg into the pan so that the whites don't touch. Repeat the process for cracking the egg into the pan. If the whites begin to touch, place one of the flat edges of your spatula in between them to keep them separated. [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can let the whites touch and separate them after they're cooked by slicing through the whites with a spatula or knife."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes. Covering the pan can accelerate the cooking process and make sure the whites are firm while the yolk remains runny. After 2 minutes, open the lid and check the whites to make sure they're cooked on the top. If not, recover the pan, and let them cook for another 30-60 seconds. You can check the doneness of the egg by shaking the pan gently to see if the yolk jiggles while the whites stay firm."

      "title": "Transfer the eggs to a plate and season with salt and pepper.",
      "content": "Transfer the eggs to a plate and season with salt and pepper. Carefully hold the pan at a 45-degree angle next to the plate, and watch as they slide off of the pan. For more control, slide a spatula under each egg, and lift it onto the plate. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste and enjoy! [5] X Research source You can serve sunny side up eggs with grits, over a piece of toast, or as part of a big breakfast with meat, potatoes, and fruit."

      "content": "Preheat an oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Use the control panel on your oven to set the heat to the correct level, and begin preparing the food while the oven heats up. This should take about 10-15 minutes, depending on your oven. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Heat an oven-proof skillet lined with 1 tsp (13.7 g) of olive oil over medium heat. Check the bottom of your skillet for a label that says “oven safe.” If it is, pour 1 teaspoon (13.7 g) of olive oil into the pan, and tilt the pan to cover the bottom with oil. Then, leave the pan on the burner until the oil begins to simmer. [7] X Research source In general, most cast iron skillets are oven safe, but many non-stick and carbon steel skillets are not."

      "title": "Crack 2 eggs into the skillet so that the whites aren't touching.",
      "content": "Crack 2 eggs into the skillet so that the whites aren't touching. Carefully break the eggs into the skillet on separate sides of the pan. If the whites touch, hold the flat edge of your spatula in between them to keep them apart until you put the pan in the oven. After both eggs are in the pan, remove it from the heat. [8] X Research source Try to crack the eggs into the pan as quickly as possible while keeping the yolks intact."

      "content": "Transfer the skillet into the oven and bake the eggs for 4 minutes. Lift the pan from the burner and gently slide it onto the center rack of the oven. Leave the pan in the oven until the whites are set, which you can check by gently shaking the pan. If the yolk jiggles and the whites stay in place, the eggs are ready! [9] X Research source With some ovens, this can take 3 and a half minutes, so keep the light on in your oven and watch the whites of each egg to see when they are fully cooked. If the yolk begins to turn white at any point, remove the eggs from the oven immediately to prevent them from cooking further."

      "content": "Remove the eggs from the oven and slide them onto a plate to season them. Use an oven mitt to pull the pan out of the oven, and tilt it at a 45-degree angle to slide the eggs off of the pan and onto a plate. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste and enjoy! [10] X Research source It's best to serve the eggs immediately to keep them from getting cold."
