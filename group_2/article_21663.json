      "content": "Avoid the person if you don’t want any contact. Look down, avoid eye contact, or perhaps even go the other way. Do what you can to ensure your paths don’t cross. Pull out your phone or even pretend to talk to someone. If you do not want to make any contact with the person, don’t. [1] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source If the person appears to want to talk to you, make it clear you do not wish to speak.

      "title": "Leave if you want to or need to.",
      "content": "Leave if you want to or need to. You don't have to stay in the presence of this person. For example, if you are with other people at a restaurant, excuse yourself and leave. You don't have to explain yourself. \"Say, I'm going to use the bathroom” or, “I need some air.” If you’re on public transportation or somewhere you can exit quickly, do so."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confront the person, if you want.",
      "content": "Confront the person, if you want. You have every right to confront the person if that’s what you want to do. If your anger or disgust push you to confront the person, decide how you want it to go. Do it for yourself and not for the other person’s reaction or anybody else’s reaction. Say what you want to and need to say and walk away feeling empowered. Make sure you are safe before confronting your abuser. Consider your location. Is it a busy public place or an isolated area? Are you alone or are there friends with you? If you believe you are in danger or that the other person might try to retaliate, do not confront the person. Instead, you may want to find an opportunity to slip away. If the opportunity comes and goes or if verbal confrontation is not for you, symbolically confront the person. Write a letter to the person and burn it."

    {
      "title": "Make a scene if they follow you.",
      "content": "Make a scene if they follow you. If you feel threatened or are approached by the person, make some noise and don’t hold back. Screaming \"Stay away from me!\" \"Leave me alone!\" or \"Don't hurt me!\" can make it very clear to passersby what's going on. This will alert other people that this person is scaring you, and it's likely that people will try to help. If strangers notice or try to help, that's good. This will help shame the rapist away and keep you safe from them. You aren't doing anything wrong by alerting people that you need protecting. If your rapist follows your car, drive to the nearest police station and walk right in. Inform the police about what's happening."

      "title": "Take some deep breaths.",
      "content": "Take some deep breaths. You may feel very shaky and panicky. It’s okay to feel this way (or any way). Calm yourself quickly by doing some deep breathing . Inhale deeply and feel the air fill your lungs. Hold your inhale, then exhale with a long breath. Repeat this exercise until you feel your mind and body feel calmer. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You can also focus on your senses to feel calm and anchor yourself in the present moment. As you breathe, use grounding techniques to help you stay calm. One way is to count to 100. Another good technique is to pick a color and find things around you that are the same color."

      "title": "Acknowledge your emotions.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your emotions. It’s okay to feel shocked, fearful, ashamed, panicked, stressed, or numb if you see someone who hurt you. You survived a horrific event and it’s okay to feel upset or even confused by seeing this person again. Acknowledge what comes up and how you feel without feeling like you have to hide from yourself. If you burst into tears or immediately run and hide, that’s okay. Acknowledge how you feel and that it’s okay to feel that way. You might need some time to process how you feel. In the days after seeing the person, take time to acknowledge your feelings and feel them. Consider using a journal or talking to a friend. If the encounter triggered you or caused new trauma, consider seeing a mental health professional for help."

      "title": "Remind yourself that it wasn’t your fault.",
      "content": "Remind yourself that it wasn’t your fault. If you see the person and instantly feel ashamed, victimized, or to blame, remind yourself that what happened was not your fault. It had nothing to do with what you wore, what you drank, or what you said. Even if you were reckless or thoughtless, lots of people are reckless or thoughtless sometimes, and that doesn't mean they deserve to be attacked. The rapist chose to hurt you and that's their fault alone. If you notice negative thought patterns are triggered, repeat to yourself that it wasn’t your fault and the blame is not on you. Self-blame and negative thoughts are common for survivors of rape, even long after the event. If you have anxiety, PTSD, or thoughts of self-harm, seek help from a mental health professional.

      "content": "Don’t pretend like everything's okay just because you think you're supposed to. You don’t need to act “okay” or pretend like you’re fine with everything just because you’re in public. If you need to cry or run the opposite direction, do so. You certainly do not need to say hello or be nice to the person. Handling your trauma and staying safe is more important than being polite or keeping up appearances. If the person approaches you, don’t feel like you have to talk or be pleasant with them."

      "content": "Avoid any unnecessary contact. While you might see this person around, avoid any potential interactions. For example, if you see the person at school or university, go places with a group of people and have a quick way to escape any potential encounters. Avoid the person’s place of work or places you know they hang out. Making these changes may be difficult, but if it helps to decrease your fear, it’s worth it.

If you have mutual friends with the person and the association upsets you, consider cutting those people out of your life, at least temporarily.
