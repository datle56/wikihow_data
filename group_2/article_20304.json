      "content": "Do crunches to strengthen your abdominal muscles. There may never be agreement among trainers as to whether or not crunches are the best way to flatten your abs, but there's no disputing the fact that they work the muscles on the front and side of your abdomen. [1] X Research source Check out some crunch variations below, and incorporate them into your exercise routine. Curl Up : Lie flat on a mat with your knees bent and your heels pressed into the mat to stabilize your body. Tilt your torso so your lower back stays pressed into the mat as well. Put your arms behind your head and keep your elbows pressed back, then curl your torso upward, being sure your lower back stays against the mat the whole time. [2] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 October 2020. Pelvic Tilt Crunch : Lie face-up on a stability ball with your back and head pressed into the ball, your feet together on the floor and a 5 to 10 lb (2.3 to 4.5 kg) dumbbell or medicine ball in your hands positioned against your chest. Tighten your abs and crunch up until your shoulders are off the ball. Then use both hands to reach the dumbbell or the medicine ball up toward the ceiling. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps resting for 30 seconds between each set. Arms Over Straight-Leg Crunch : Grab a pair of 10 to 12 lb (4.5 to 5.4 kg) dumbbells and lie on your back with your arms behind you and your legs extended and raised to a 45-degree angle. Bring your arms up over your chest and lift your shoulders off the mat while raising your legs until they're perpendicular to the floor. Return to your starting position without letting your legs touch the floor. Do 3 sets of 15 repetitions with a 30-second rest period between sets."

      "content": "Work your core to strengthen your abs. Your core is made up of your abdominal muscles plus the muscles of your lower back, pelvic floor and hips—more than 15 muscles in all. To work toward a flat stomach, do core exercises that target all of these muscles. [3] X Research source Side Plank : Lie on your left side with your elbow directly beneath your shoulder and your legs stacked one on top of the other. Place your right hand on your left shoulder or on your right hip. Tighten your abs and lift your hips off the floor until you're balancing on your forearm and feet so that your body forms a diagonal line. Hold for 30 to 45 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side. If you can’t hold the pose for 30 to 45 seconds, stay up as long as you can and work your way up. Push-up Walkout : Get on the floor in a push-up position and place your hands so they're two inches wider than your shoulders. Keeping your feet in place, walk your hands out as far as possible, then walk back. Do 10-12 reps. For more of a challenge, lift one leg before you walk your hands out and back. Climbing Rope : Sit down with your legs extended out in front of you and your feet turned out in a V position. Point your toes. Contract your core muscles and roll your spine into a C-curve. Lift your arms up and move them as if you were climbing a rope twisting slightly with each reach. Do 20 reaches with each arm."

By choosing the right fabrics and styles, you can create the illusion of a smaller tummy. [24] X Research source Pick fabrics that skim the body. These include woven cotton, silk or rayon blends, and lightweight wool blends. Stay away from fabrics that cling, such as Lycra and lightweight knits; they tend to emphasize every bulge. Divert the eye. Look for garments with features that draw the eye away from your midsection. For example, tops with detailing around the neckline or a ruffle down the center give the eye something else to focus on rather than your stomach. Wrap tops and dresses are also good choices, as long as they're not made from the kind of clingy fabric you're looking to avoid. Add a belt. Use a wide belt in a dark color to cinch your waist, separating the hips and bust and creating a waistline. Play around with patterns. Geometric and floral patterns can be a good way to disguise a bit of a belly. Put color to work for you. Yes, black is the most slimming color, but it's not your only choice. Experts recommend purple, navy, burgundy, eggplant, charcoal gray and deep emerald for a slim look. Go monochromatic and dress head-to-toe in just one color—another way to look long and lean."
