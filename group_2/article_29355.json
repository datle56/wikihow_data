      "content": "Measure and cut out squares from the cardboard. Use a ruler and pencil to mark out your squares, and cut them out using a pair of sharp, sturdy scissors. You can make your magic box any size that you want, but you’ll need six squares of the same size no matter what their size. For a manageable small box, measure 4”-6” squares."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make one side of the squares black.",
      "content": "Make one side of the squares black. You can do this by gluing the cardboard squares onto the black construction paper or by painting one side with black paint. For one square, glue black paper to or paint both sides. Paper may be preferable, as it is the same color and texture throughout. You also don't have to worry about smearing the paint. If you glue your squares to construction paper, allow the glue to dry. Then cut them out and trim the excess paper from the edges."

      "content": "Tape the edges of four squares together. Place four squares on your work surface with the black side down. Tape their edges together, then bring the last two sides together to form a box. Place a strip of tape on the outside of that edge too. Don’t use the double-sided square for this step."

      "title": "Form the secret compartment.",
      "content": "Form the secret compartment. Place the remaining single-sided cardboard square on your work surface with the black side face up. Place one edge of the double-sided square about ⅓ of the way from one edge of the square. Secure with tape on that side to form a hinge."

    {
      "title": "Put the box together.",
      "content": "Put the box together. Slide the four-sided box you made in Step 4 over the secret compartment piece. The double-sided square should create a flap inside the box and should be able to move freely back and forth. Secure at the bottom with tape. If the flap isn’t able to move, trim the edges just a little bit. Don’t trim too much, or you’ll ruin the illusion."

Place the box on its long narrow side and trace around it. Repeat this process a second time. Place a playing card on the cardboard and trace around it. Repeat this process a second time.

Glue the photocopy of the back of the playing card (it usually has some sort of pattern) to the back of the fake deck. Glue the photocopies of the deck edges (the ridged edges of the cards when they’re held as a stack) to the sides of the fake deck.

Place one or two real playing cards on top of the fake deck. Hold the fake deck vertically, keeping the open top facing upwards. Cover the open top with your fingers. Show the audience the “deck,” keeping the real cards fanned out in front of the fake deck. Slide the fake deck into the real box, keeping the open top facing upwards. Do some tapping and say a few magic words. Be very showy about it Then, open the real box to reveal that it's \"empty\"!"
