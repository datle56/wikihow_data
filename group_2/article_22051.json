Gently spread your outer labia (the large, fleshy pads or “lips” on the outside of your vulva) and wipe around the skin folds inside, making sure to wash around the hood of your clitoris and the area outside the entrance to your vagina. Rinse thoroughly with warm water, then let the area dry naturally or pat it dry with a clean towel. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Washing your vulva once a day is enough. Overwashing can disrupt the healthy bacteria in your vagina and cause symptoms, such as dryness, itching, and irritation. [2] X Research source “The vagina is a self-cleaning organ,” says board-certified urogynecologist Cindy Basinski, MD. That means you shouldn’t use scented soap or douches, or get soap inside your vagina—it can alter your vagina’s natural pH balance, possibly leading to a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Basinski also agrees that “it’s best to stay away from scented wipes and deodorant sprays, which can cause irritation and wash away good bacteria.” Putting products inside your vagina “can cause contact dermatitis or a rash type situation.”"

Try sleeping without underwear or wearing loose-fitting pajama bottoms at night.

There are many period tracking apps, like Flo and Clue , but you can also use a journal, diary, or period calendar. Write down the first day of your period, and keep track over several months. If you have an irregular cycle, talk to your parent, gynecologist, or primary healthcare provider for advice and possible treatment. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but it varies from person to person.

Then, make sure to lather it up at the back of the head and wash the tips of your hair. Rinse the shampoo out thoroughly, running your fingers through the stands as you go. If your hair is still slippery, that means the shampoo isn't out, and your hair will get greasy over the next 24 hours. Repeat this process with a conditioner to strengthen your hair. Rinse it out completely. “Everyone's hair type needs a different level of moisture,” says professional hair stylist Jenny Tran. “The more moisture you need, the longer you should go between shampooing. Eventually, your body will recognize that it no longer needs to produce an excessive amount of oil to hydrate your scalp.”"
