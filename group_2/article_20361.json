Not only is your body and voice changing, but you're walking around filled with confusing hormones and new emotions, while trying to balance your school work and navigating a tricky social arena. Though the people around you may appear confident, it's likely that they're just masking their deep insecurities with arrogance, and that's exactly what you should avoid. Here's how to make her notice you by being truly confident: [2] X Research source Take the time to look good. This doesn't mean spending hours gelling your hair or grinning in front of the mirror. Just make sure to take regular showers, style your hair, and wear clothes that flatter your body and show off your style. Oh, and make sure to wear pants that actually fit you. Pursue your interests. Seriously. No matter how \"nerdy\" you may feel your real interests may be, if you're really passionate about something, you will make it cool. Don't try out for the football team just because that's what all of your friends are doing if you'd rather play golf, or join the French club.

If you're interested in something in class, ask questions. She'll be impressed that you're so comfortable with who you are that you do whatever you want. Address your flaws. Part of being confident means knowing you're not perfect. Everyone in high school has plenty of growing to do, and that's natural. If you know you need to work on being more sensitive or a better friend, then do it."

Here's how to do it: [3] X Research source Be friends with everyone. Though navigating high school cliques can be tricky and you can't be a part of every friend group, you should take the time to get to know a variety of people. This will show the girl that you're friendly and don't care about the status of the people that you talk to, and that you're a versatile person. Drop the haters. Don't hang out with dudes who are mean to women, or who pick on the uncool kids. Girls are completely turned off by that, and you should avoid hanging out with haters or you'll look like one too. Always be laughing. Laugh and smile as much as you can. If you're surrounded by a force field of positive energy, the girl of your dreams will gravitate toward you."

Unless you're sitting in a movie, you'll have to strike up an interesting conversation. Come prepared with a few interesting things to say, whether it's related to one of her interests, your family, or just something funny that happened in school. Avoid putting people down or saying everything is lame. Take her somewhere that makes her feel special. Take her on a cute mini-golfing date and then go out for ice cream. If there's a new fancy restaurant in town, take her there if it's her thing. If she really wanted to go to the movies and local restaurant, fine. But treat it like a real date and try paying for everything if she lets you. Always make her feel special. Without sounding like an interviewer, you should ask her about her interests, her friends, her family, and her opinion on a variety of subjects. Turn your phone OFF during this time."
