      "title": "Avoid shapeless clothing.",
      "content": "Avoid shapeless clothing. Many heavy set women settle for shapeless plus sized clothing because they feel a need to hide their heaviness. Oversized, baggy pieces only make you look larger, however. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for tailored pieces.",
      "content": "Look for tailored pieces. Like any other woman, you should dress in a way that works with the natural contours of your shape and accentuates your curves.

    },
    {
      "title": "Dress your size.",
      "content": "Dress your size. Clothes that are too tight will show any rolls of fat or excess weight you likely want to hide. Clothes that are too big will make you look boxy and larger than necessary. Purchase clothing that brushes against your body without squeezing it, and remember that bunching or pulling will only draw unflattering attention to those areas of your body. [2] X Research source Remember that there is no standardized sizing, so don't be alarmed if you're two sizes bigger than you think you are or two sizes smaller than you think you are. It doesn't matter. When trying on some pants, you should get help, because it's really hard to check the fit from behind by yourself."

      "title": "Consider long tops and coats that brush past your hip.",
      "content": "Consider long tops and coats that brush past your hip. Long, fitted pieces that extend past your hip create a smooth, streamlined silhouette that may make your hips and stomach look thinner.

      "title": "Opt for tops that stop above the hip if you are a plus sized petite.",
      "content": "Opt for tops that stop above the hip if you are a plus sized petite. Long tops may only make you look shorter and stouter. Tops and jackets that stop just above your hip bone elongate your leg, reducing the appearance of stoutness."

      "content": "Gravitate toward A-line skirts and dresses. A-line skirts flare out toward the bottom, creating a flattering silhouette for your hips. Wrap dresses and empire waist dresses are also very flattering since they define your waist and drape naturally off your curves."

      "title": "Know your body type.",
      "content": "Know your body type. Not all heavy set bodies are the same. You may be an apple shape who carries her weight around her stomach, a pear shape who carries her weight around her thighs, an inverted triangle who carries her weight in her chest, or a rectangle whose weight is evenly distributed throughout her body. Determine your body type and learn about what styles of dress flatter your shape best. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid large patterns.",
      "content": "Avoid large patterns. Huge patterns that cover your entire outfit often appear overwhelming. As a result, your curves get masked, and you may end up looking heavier. Stick with smaller patterns or patterns that are limited to one area of your body."
