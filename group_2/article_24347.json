      "title": "Note what type of fruit tree it was.",
      "content": "Note what type of fruit tree it was. The type of fruit tree can make a difference to the interpretation. Different types of fruit represent different things. For instance, apple trees can mean joy and entertainment, while fruits that cluster together on the tree can mean togetherness and unity. If you associated good memories with your grandmother's apple tree, it could be a sense of contentment about a decision you recently made to have children, symbolized by the baby. Remember, what you dream is related to your life, so you should always interpret in relation to your thoughts and memories. Grapefruit could mean you've felt in high spirits lately while kiwi could mean you need to be revitalized [7] X Research source"
