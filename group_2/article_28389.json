      "content": "Use a round brush to sweep your hair upward and back. As you dry your hair, use a wave-like brushing motion. This will lock your hair in an upward sweeping motion, while creating volume throughout your hair. For short hair, this may be all you need to get it to stand straight up. Longer hair may need the help of additional product. To get maximum volume, blow-dry your hair in the opposite direction of how you want it to fall. For instance, if you want it to be swept back, brush it forward as you dry it. That will give you more lift at your roots."

Using too much product can weigh down your hair, which can prevent it from standing up. When in doubt, use less clay/paste than you think you’ll need. You can always apply more later."
