Believe it or not, you can resurrect that perfectly good frame from the traps of that old, not-so-trendy fabric. Some lamps will have one-piece frames and some will have a set of two rings: a washer top and a bottom wire ring, generally. If you're unhappy with what you have at your disposal, new lampshade wire rings are available at some craft supply stores. This project will be constructing a drum shade--the fancy name for a circular shade. These are generally made up of two separate rings."

      "title": "Know your dimensions.",
      "content": "Know your dimensions. Maybe you have all the materials, but are they the right sizes? Check out your lamp rings first; they're the hardest to replace. Your fabric needs to be at the very least one inch (2.5 cm) wider and longer than the width and circumference of your lampshade. You can either measure the circumference with a measuring tape or use the 'ol handy 3.14 x diameter trick. For example, if the diameter of your lampshade is 14 inches, 3.14 x 14 = 43.96, the circumference of your lampshade. So, you should be working with material that's at least 45 inches long. You can choose how far apart you want your rings to be to determine the width . A little more than a foot (31 cm) is standard."

      "content": "Cut your fabric and styrene to the correct size and shape. Once you've measured your fabric, you can cut your styrene to fit it. The styrene should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) narrower and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) shorter than your fabric. Styrene doesn't stick well to synthetic fibers -- use linen, cotton or silk for your fabric."

      "content": "Wrap the lamp wire with bias tape. This customizes your lamp, hides any old, rusting wire, and coordinates even the inside of the lamp with the room. Be sure to wrap the rings and spokes. Bias tape comes in different colors and patterns; you can even make your own. Use quick-drying fabric glue and apply to the rings, not the tape. When you come to the end, just cut it off and adhere."

If your frame bends while you're messing with it, just bend it back to its original shape, no harm done. All paneled shades use frames, not rings.

This is important: If your frame is uniform all the way around, one panel will suffice. But if your shade is, for example, rectangular in shape, create a pattern for each size of panel. Use chalk or a marking pen to trace the spokes that form the panel shape onto the muslin. [3] X Research source Take pins to the frame to keep it tight."

If you are working with a paneled shade, simply take the measurement of each panel; if you are working with a circular shade, measure the circumference (3.14 x diameter). This is necessary to find out how long and wide your strips of fabric need to be and the amount that will cover your entire shade."

Just make sure they're long enough! Add one extra inch for the seam allowance. This is needed to wrap around the wire frame. [5] X Research source If your lamp is 20\" (51 cm) around, make sure you have fabric that, in total, amounts to at least 22\" (56 cm) wide. You need adequate overlap to keep the wire frame from showing. Of course, greater overlap than that is always safe, too. If each strip of fabric is 2\" (5 cm) across, have at least 11 strips of fabric ready."

Using your 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side, affix the strip to the top of the shade with a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Repeat for the bottom. If you use a hot glue gun and glue the material to the wire, you will not be able to gather the fabric when it's finished. If you use a staple gun, it's a good idea to add decorative trim around the top and bottom to obscure those tiny metallic lines from view."
