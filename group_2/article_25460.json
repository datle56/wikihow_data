      "content": "He’ll look and reply if he wants to stay updated on your life. If you’re always posting Snaps to your Story, take a peek to see if his name is on the list of people who looked at it. If his name is one of the first to pop up after you post your Story, it’s a sign he wants to know you better. He may even send you a message referencing what you posted since it’s a really easy way for him to start a conversation. [1] X Research source Try to post cute selfies or fun pictures of what you’re doing so he’s more likely to reply to them."

      "content": "A guy will want to see your Snaps again if he wants a good look at you. Snapchat has a cool feature that lets people watch your Snaps one more time; plus, you’re notified if they do it! Scroll through your Snap History with your guy. Your Snaps will say “replayed” next to them if your crush watched them again. If you want to be a real flirt, shorten the time limit on your Snaps so he only sees them for a few seconds. That forces him to replay your Snaps so he can get a better view."

      "title": "If he sends you the first pic, he wants to get to know you better.",
      "content": "If he sends you the first pic, he wants to get to know you better. When a boy is crushing on you, he’ll do what he can to reach out before you do and act a little flirty. If you’re always getting notifications from a guy but you haven’t even Snapped him yet, he’s trying to get your attention and chat with you. It’s okay for you to send the first Snap every now and then if you want to show that you’re into him, too!"

      "title": "A lot of Snaps from a guy could mean he’s excited to talk to you.",
      "content": "A lot of Snaps from a guy could mean he’s excited to talk to you. When a boy likes you, he’ll show off his life to make him look like an interesting person. Open the chat with your crush and count how many times he Snaps you compared to how often you Snap him. If he’s sent more or if you have a pretty even balance in the conversation, it may be because he’s trying to flirt. [2] X Research source Are you also into him? Don’t hesitate to send him lots of Snaps, too! This is a great way to flirt and show you’re interested."

      "title": "You won’t find the Snaps he shares with you on his Story.",
      "content": "You won’t find the Snaps he shares with you on his Story. If a guy also posts a Snap in his stories or shares it in a group chat, then he’s sending it to a lot of people. If he sends you a Snap directly, then you know that it was meant for your eyes only. He’ll probably keep Snaps between the two of you private if he wants to make you feel special and let you know he’s crushing on you, too. [3] X Research source Follow suit if you like him back. It’s okay to start the conversation first to get the ball rolling!"

      "content": "If you only see pics of a guy looking his best, he’s trying to show off. When a guy wants to stay friends, he’ll likely send some unflattering pictures from time to time. If you notice that his Snaps always have really good lighting or show off his best features, he’s taking some extra time to pose and look good for you. [4] X Research source Guys will also try to show off by sending you something cool that they’re doing, like hanging out at the beach or working out. Impress him with your own outrageously gorgeous photo to show that you care about what he thinks about you too."

      "content": "The extra effort he puts into his Snap means he cares about you. While he’ll send normal pictures most of the time, pay attention if your crush adds drawings, stickers, filters, and text. When you open a Snap from your crush, take note of everything that he’s added to make the picture unique. He’ll make goofy drawings or write a really thoughtful message on the Snap to put you in a good mood if he’s really interested."

      "content": "His Snap may last a few seconds if he wants you to reply or replay it. If you open a Snap and you barely get a glimpse of the picture before it disappears, the guy might have done it on purpose. Since he’ll think you want another look at him, he’s trying to get you to watch the Snap again or message him asking about it. That way, he has a really easy way to start a conversation. Lean into it if you like him back! Replay his stories to say, “Yeah, I like what I see.”"

If he’s really excited when he sees the notification from you, he’ll likely check it almost immediately and write something back. [5] X Research source If the guy’s busy when you send him a Snap, he might not be able to answer it right away, so don’t fret! This isn’t a foolproof sign, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye out for."

      "title": "He’ll want to flatter you and make you feel good if he likes you.",
      "content": "He’ll want to flatter you and make you feel good if he likes you. He may give you compliments in your chat conversation or say them directly in a Snap’s caption. When he says something that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, he’s trying to make you feel good, and it’s a sign that he likes you more than a friend. Try giving him a few compliments back so he knows you’re into him too! He might say something like, “You look so good right now!” or “That was amazing! You’re always so impressive!” So, you could respond with, “I bet I don’t look as good as you,” or “Please! I couldn't have reached my goal without your support!”"

      "content": "If a guy pokes fun at your pics or messages, it may be because he’s into you. Some guys try to tell jokes or indirectly flirt with a sarcastic comment. When he says something funny in response to one of your Snaps, he’s showing off his sense of humor and trying to push your buttons to see if you’re playful in response. [6] X Research source For example, if you take a Snap of you bowling, he might say something like, “I bet I could beat you 😉” or “Wow, those bowling shoes look soooo good on you haha.” If you like him back, play into his playfulness! Don’t be afraid to toss around a flirt or silly comment of your own."

He might get a little flirty with his messages, but he won’t push any of your boundaries. When a guy asks for intimate pictures or sends racy messages, he might not be Snapping you for the right reasons. [7] X Research source"
