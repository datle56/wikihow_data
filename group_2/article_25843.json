At the same time, lower your right hand with the palm face up. Have your partner do the same. Then, clap your hands against your partner’s by simultaneously bringing down your left hands and bringing up your right hands until both of your hands meet. Then, reverse hands and clap the other way (starting with the right hands up high and the left hands down low).

The standard variation of the song finishes with “ Turn around / Touch the ground / Push your brother out of town / And stomp. ” On “turn around,” spin around in a circle. On “touch the ground,” touch the ground. On “push your brother out of town,” make a shoving motion with your hands. On “stomp,” jump! Switch up your actions or gestures if you’re using a variation on the lyrics. We’ve included some of the different lyrics and gestures below, but you can see the full lyrics for each version here . “Kick your boyfriend out of town” = Make a kicking motion. “Kick Dr. Pepper out of town” = Make a kicking motion. “Touch your nose” = Touch your nose. “Make a pose” = Strike any funny or silly pose. “And freeze” = Freeze (and don’t move!). “Freeze like American cheese” = Freeze (and don’t move!)."
