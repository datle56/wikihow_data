      "title": "Not hearing from your ex can help you move on faster.",
      "content": "Not hearing from your ex can help you move on faster. Right after you two break up, block their number and unfollow them on social media. That way, you don’t have to keep tabs on their life and see what they’re up to on a daily basis, which can make it tough to move on. [1] X Research source Even if you feel like you need to apologize for what happened, it’s a good idea to leave your ex alone for now. Getting a ton of “I’m sorry” messages and calls can drag the breakup out for your ex, and it might not make you feel much better, either. It can also help to set some ground rules with your ex about respecting each other's space and boundaries."

      "title": "Unfortunately, blaming other people will only prolong your breakup.",
      "content": "Unfortunately, blaming other people will only prolong your breakup. If you’re the one who caused the breakup, it’s natural to look at outside sources and try to shift the blame elsewhere. However, the more you can take responsibility for what happened without making excuses, the faster you can move on from it. [2] X Research source If you broke up with your partner but you regret it, you might think, “I chose to break things off. It was my decision, no one else’s.” If you did something to make your partner break up with you, you might think, “I am responsible for my actions.”"

      "title": "Being realistic can help you move on from your relationship.",
      "content": "Being realistic can help you move on from your relationship. After you break up, it’s easy to look back at the past through rose-colored glasses. However, try to remember the not-so-good parts of your relationship, too. Make a list of these things and look at it whenever you start to miss your ex. [3] X Research source Your list might say: We had different goals for the future. They didn’t understand my need for freedom. We fought a lot over little things. They didn’t get along with my friends."

      "content": "Learning promotes growth, which can make you a better person. Even if the relationship ended badly, you can still take away some lessons to use during your next relationship. Think back on what happened and how you can use your past relationship to set you up for success in the future. [4] X Research source If you broke things off and now you regret it, you might learn that you need to give yourself time to adjust before breaking things off at the first sign of trouble. If you pushed the boundaries in your relationship and broke your partner’s trust, you might learn that you need to discuss those boundaries early-on with your new partner."

      "content": "Blame and guilt can make you feel bad for a long time. While it’s good to take responsibility for your actions, beating yourself up over them isn’t productive. Learn what you can from what happened, then decide to forgive yourself for the past. You’ll be much happier overall, and you’ll have an easier time moving forward. [5] X Research source Nobody’s perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. Keep that in mind as you work toward forgiveness and acceptance of your own actions. Forgiveness is a gift for you, since it frees you from the frustration and anger of the situation."

      "title": "Getting your feelings out will help you process what happened.",
      "content": "Getting your feelings out will help you process what happened. If you need to vent to someone about your breakup, call up a close friend or ask them to come hang out with you. Talk about what happened, why you two broke up, and how you’re feeling about it now. [6] X Research source Be sure to talk to someone who won’t judge you. You want to be able to talk freely, not worry about them gossiping about you behind your back. Venting to someone you trust is an important part of your personal healing and renewal after the relationship ends. If you don’t feel like talking to friends is enough, reach out to a therapist for professional help. Reader Poll: We asked 566 wikiHow readers who've gone through a breakup, and only 7% of them agreed that the best way to cope is by seeking professional help. [Take Poll] Always see a therapist or seek other help if you need it, but in many cases, relying on your loved ones is enough."

      "content": "Jumping into a rebound relationship could make your heartbreak worse. While finding someone new right away might sound like a good idea, in reality, it could prolong your negative feelings from the breakup. Give yourself time to heal, and don’t start dating again until you’re really ready. [7] X Research source There’s no specific timetable for how long it might take you to heal from a breakup. In general, if you can go a few days without thinking about your ex, you might be ready to move on."

      "content": "Thinking positively about the future will give you hope. When you go through a breakup, it’s easy to feel like you’ll never find someone as good as your ex. However, keep in mind that there are plenty of fish in the sea, and you’re bound to find someone else you like. Your ex might have been great, but remind yourself that you will find love again. [8] X Research source When the breakup is fresh, this thought might be more painful than helpful. However, as time goes on, you’ll find it comforting."

      "content": "Get excited for your future to move on from the past. When you were with your ex, you probably made a few goals and plans together. Now that you’re single, it’s time to rewrite those goals and make a few new ones of your own. Try making a list of some short-term and long-term goals to keep your mind off of things and look forward toward the future. [9] X Research source For instance: Finish my degree Buy a new car within the next 5 years Travel abroad at least twice Save up for a down payment on a house"

      "content": "Keeping your mind off of things will help you heal. If you’re having a bad day or you’re just really feeling down, call up a friend and ask them to hang out. You don’t have to talk about the breakup or your ex—just do something fun to get out of the house. Ask your friend to keep you talking and to not let you dwell on what happened with your breakup. If you don’t have a ton of close relationships with anyone right now, that’s okay! Try meeting new people by volunteering or joining a hobby group in your area."
