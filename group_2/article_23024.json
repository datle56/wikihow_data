      "content": "Most people burn 1,300 to 2,000 calories daily without doing anything. The exact number varies by person, but overall, your body never stops burning calories—even when you’re not doing anything. That’s because burning calories enables your body to function (from pumping blood to breathing). [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The constant calorie burn happening inside your body is called your metabolism. Thus, your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories your body needs to consume (and burn) to run smoothly. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Keep in mind that the energy your body makes while not doing anything is consumed in the food you eat. Although you naturally burn calories, exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle!"

Still, it’s possible to find approximate values with the average height and weight of a male, which is 5 feet, 9 inches tall (175 centimeters) and 199.8 pounds (90.5 kilograms). [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Thus, in a day, depending on their age, men burn: Age 20: 2,020 calories Age 30: 1,964 calories Age 40: 1,907 calories Age 50: 1,850 calories Age 60: 1,793 calories Age 70: 1,737 calories Age 80: 1,680 calories"

However, keep in mind that the average woman—5 feet, 2 1/2 inches tall (157 cm) and 170.8 pounds (77.4 kg)—also tends to be shorter and weigh less than the average male, so the number of calories they burn while doing nothing is naturally lower.

      "content": "Use the BMR formula for your gender. For women, the formula is 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years). For men, the formula is 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years). Plug your weight, height, and age into the formula to find your BMR. [6] X Research source For example, a woman who’s 150 pounds (68 kg), 63 inches (160 cm) tall, and 20 years old would use the formula: 655 + 652.5 + 296.1 - 94. The result is 1,506.6, which means she’d burn that many calories daily without doing anything."

      "content": "Calculate your metabolic rate per minute for different activities. Your BMR accounts for roughly 60% to 70% of your daily calorie burn, and the rest is from activities! So, use the formula (MET x your weight in Kg x 3.5) ÷ 200 to calculate your metabolic rate per minute for a specific activity. [7] X Research source Then, to find your hourly BMR, multiply the result by 60. “MET” (Metabolic Equivalent Task) is the energy cost of an activity. Activities like standing, walking a dog, raking leaves, and gardening all have different MET values—so they burn calories at different rates. Check the Compendium of Physical Activities online for a complete list of MET values. [8] X Research source So, using an average weight of 175 lbs (79.4 kg), daily activities burn roughly: Resting, sitting, or sleeping: 108 calories per hour (1.3 MET) Standing: 208 calories per hour (2.5 MET) Walking a dog: 250 calories per hour (3 MET) Raking: 333 calories per hour (4 MET) Gardening: 417 calories per hour (5 MET) Mowing: 500 calories per hour (6 MET) Climbing stairs: 733 calories per hour (8.8 MET)"

Everyone has a metabolic rate, but your specific BMR (and, therefore, the number of calories you burn in a day) is unique because it depends entirely on you. Finding your exact BMR means taking your height, weight, sex, muscle-to-fat ratio, and even genetics into account.

      "content": "Achieve a calorie deficit to lose weight. If your goal is to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat (or eat fewer calories than you burn). An effective weight-loss deficit is usually between 400 to 500 calories. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source That means your goal should be to burn 400 to 500 more calories than you consume in a day or eat 400 to 500 fewer calories than your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). If you need to find your TDEE, try using an online calculator . However, “Calories can’t be restricted too dramatically in a safe manner,” cautions physical trainer Dean Theriot. “Everyone has an individual amount they need…going significantly below that caloric intake isn’t healthy.” Generally, men need at least 1,500 calories per day, and women need at least 1,300.

If you want to keep your current weight rather than gaining or losing any, try consuming roughly the same number of calories that your body burns for energy each day. So, for example, if your body burns 2,000 calories per day, that’s exactly as many calories as you should consume.

      "content": "Exercise more to build muscle mass. Want to burn more calories with a higher metabolism? It’s very possible to change your metabolic rate through simple lifestyle changes—the foremost of which is exercise. That’s because exercise builds muscle mass, and more muscle mass requires your body to use more energy, even while resting. Losing muscle actually slows down your metabolic rate (the speed at which your body burns calories), which is counterproductive for weight loss—so maintain a daily (or weekly) exercise routine that lets you preserve your muscle while still losing weight if that’s your goal.
