      "content": "Lipstick is great for adding color to your lips, but some types can be very drying. If you like to wear lipstick, look for something that says \"hydrating\" on the label. Apply lip balm under your lipstick for even more hydration and smoothness. Take a pass on the lip gloss, which tends to be drying. If you must use lip gloss, apply it over your lip balm. Choose creamy lipstick over matte lipstick. Creamy lipstick is generally more moisturizing than matte lipstick, which tends to be drying. Apply lip balm, then brush your lips for smoother lipstick application. Before you apply any lipstick, apply a good, hydrating lip balm. Wait 5 minutes, then gently brush your lips with a clean toothbrush dipped in water. Rinse your lips with water, pat them dry, then apply your lipstick. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Creasing is often caused by smoking, drinking from bottles, and pursing your lips. It is also a natural sign of aging. You can add more definition to your lips by applying a pea-sized amount of a retinol-based cream to the skin around your lips. [3] X Research source Apply the cream nightly. If you have sensitive skin, apply it every other night instead. This cream should be available over-the-counter. If you can't find it in your local pharmacy, ask your doctor about getting a prescription."

How often you exfoliate depends on how flaky or sensitive your lips are. Once or twice a week should be enough for most people. [4] X Research source If you have very sensitive skin, you may have to exfoliate every other week. To make your own lip scrub, combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of coconut oil or olive oil, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey, and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of brown sugar. Massage some of the scrub onto your lips using small, circular motions. Leave it on for 1 to 2 minutes, then rinse it off with warm water. Follow up with lip balm. [5] X Research source"

Wipe most of the petroleum jelly off, but leave a thin coating for hydration. [6] X Research source Need a little more exfoliating power? Mix a little bit of sugar into the petroleum jelly, then massage it onto your lips with your finger instead. This technique is similar to using lip balm and a toothbrush, but it allows you to use more petroleum jelly, which some people find gentler/more hydrating. You can also massage your lips with a paste made from baking soda and water. Mix enough baking soda and water to make a paste. Apply the paste to a soft, clean toothbrush. Massage your lips with the toothbrush using circular motions. Rinse the paste off, then follow-up with lip balm. [7] X Research source"

Salty foods may also dry out your lips because of the fine, salty coating they leave on your lips. This does not mean that you have to give these foods up forever; once the flaking stops, you can try slowly reintroducing them into your diet."
