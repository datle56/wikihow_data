      "content": "Determine the type of cord you’ll need based on your project. There are so many types of cords you can use for macramé. You can use cotton rope, yarn, twine, leather, or anything else that comes in an easily pliable strand. [1] X Expert Source Lois Wade wikiHow Crafts Expert Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. Leather is great if you’re making jewelry. Cotton rope works well if you’re making a wall hanging, and you can use yarn to make a scarf or blanket."

      "content": "Collect a few sewing pins. Depending on the knots you’ll be using, you might need pins to hold your knotting material out of the way. Sewing pins are a great option for this. You can also use thumbtacks."

      "title": "Create a project board.",
      "content": "Create a project board. This doesn’t have to be anything fancy, just something portable, but soft enough to push pins through. You can glue a garden kneeling pad or an old foam sleeping pad to a clipboard. You can also use balsa wood or styrofoam."

      "title": "Choose an anchor.",
      "content": "Choose an anchor. The anchor is the piece of metal, wood or plastic that you attach your knotting material to. You'll set it at the top of your project board and use it to build your project on. Your anchors will vary depending on the project. If you’re making jewelry or a keychain, a keyring is probably best. For larger projects, a dowel or a rod will work well."

      "title": "Fold your cord in half.",
      "content": "Fold your cord in half. You’ll want to make sure that your fold is exactly half. You’ll be using the rest of this cord for other knots, and if it’s uneven, it might affect the rest of your project."

      "title": "Place the loop under your anchor.",
      "content": "Place the loop under your anchor. Place the loop formed by folding the cord in half under the dowel or rod with the 2 ends of the cord above. If you’re using a ring, place the loop under one side of the ring, so the loop is in the center."

      "title": "Pull the loop up and the cords down through it.",
      "content": "Pull the loop up and the cords down through it. Pull the loop over the rod, dowel, or edge of the ring. Stick your finger up through the loop and grasp both halves of the cord. Pull them down through the loop. The loop and cords should make a pretzel shape."

      "content": "Pull down on the cord to make the knot tight. Hold the rod, dowel, or ring with 1 hand. With the other, pull down on the 2 halves of the cord. As you do, the loop will move up toward the rod, dowel, or ring, pulling the knot tight."

      "title": "Set up multiple cords for new projects.",
      "content": "Set up multiple cords for new projects. Most macramé projects are going to require at least 2 sets of knotting cords. You’ll therefore need to tie at least 2 reverse lark’s head knots, with 2 pieces of macramé cord, on the same anchor, to start any project."

      "content": "Distinguish between your knotting cords and your knot-bearing cords. Once you’ve tied your reverse lark’s head knot, you’ll have 2 cords hanging down. The knotting cord is the cord you'll move to make the knot. The knot-bearing cord is the one you'll be folding the knotting cord over or under to make the knot."

      "title": "Continue making half knots to create a spiral design.",
      "content": "Continue making half knots to create a spiral design. As you tie more and more half knots with your cord, a spiral will naturally occur in the cord. How many knots it takes to create 1 swirl in the spiral will depend on how thick your cord is. Once you have the number of swirls you like, tie off the cord."

Pull the left knotting cord over the knot-bearing cords in the middle, and tuck it under the right knotting cord.

      "content": "Divide the cords into sets of 4. Each set of 4 strands will make one square knot. If you’ve tied more than 8 cords to your rod or dowel, that’s fine. You just have to have enough workable cords to be divided by 4 evenly."

Stick the pin into your project board near the anchor and just to the left of the cords. Pull the knotting cord out and around the pin, then cross it over the knot-bearing cords at a diagonal angle. Secure the end of the knotting cord with another pin, about 1 in (2.5 cm) down from where your first pin is. If you want a more dramatic diagonal angle, pin the end of the knotting cord further down."

      "content": "Make a zigzag by tying another diagonal half hitch. Once you reach the end of the diagonal, you can make a zigzag pattern by tying a diagonal half hitch in the opposite direction. So if you started on the left to begin, start on the right this time. Your right outside cord is the knot-tying cord and the other cords to the left are all knot-bearing cords. You can also just keep repeating the diagonal half hitch from the same side to get a diagonal design with the knots close together."
