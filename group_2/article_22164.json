If the weather is nice, try going for a 30-minute walk around your neighborhood after school or ask your parents if you can join the local recreation center. Exercising gives you endorphins, which can also help you deal with stress."

You could take guitar lessons or drawing classes, or look online for tutorials on something you’re interested in to teach yourself a new skill! If you already have a hobby you love, you could try to pursue it more passionately. For example, if you taught yourself how to play an instrument, maybe you could take lessons. Or if you like to do crafts, choose a more complicated project to work on. wikiHow has great tutorials, as do sites like Skillshare and YouTube."

There will be more information in each lesson for you to understand and review. To remember this information, you will need to take organized notes. Use bullet points and draw graphs or charts to let you understand the information. Highlight important key words, like \"velocity\" or \"distance\" if you're taking beginner physics notes, or \"variable\", \"slope\", or \"equation\" if you're taking algebra notes. Don't worry- there will still be review of things you learned in 7th grade, as with every year of school. At the beginning of 8th grade, you will review things you have learned in 7th grade, so the first month of school will be easy if you have understood and remembered all of the concepts. After the review, however, you will learn a multitude of unfamiliar concepts."

You may not be the oldest people out of the whole mandatory education system yet (only if you're in 12th grade), but you're around 13-14 years old! This sounds cool to many kids, as they are older, more mature, and know more things than the younger kids. They are also experts in opening lockers, going to office hours, and handling some extracurriculars. Even though you may be the oldest, you do not have more rights than the younger kids. You still need to obey the school rules, or you may get in trouble. Don't bully kids from lower grade levels. They likely want someone to help them, and bullying them is mean. Remember the time when you were new to middle school, in 5th, 6th, or 7th grade. You were probably shy, lost, scared, and not used to middle school. You would not want someone older (the 8th and 9th graders) to bully you, right?"

They may just be a freshman, or they could be a junior, senior, or even in their first year of college already. If your sibling has a large age difference (more than 6 years), they may not remember their 8th grade experience. If you are younger than your sibling by 2-5 years, that's a good age range, since your older sibling/s will likely remember their high school and 8th grade years. Talk to them about your concerns, like homework and peer pressure. Ask your older sibling to share some funny experiences that they had in their last years of middle school.

This math actually prepares you for high school, and it is going to be a direct precursor to it. If you're in an advanced math course, you may already be learning public high school math such as algebra 1 or geometry. For those in regular public school math class, you're going to be starting pre-algebra. [3] X Research source Practice graphing lines onto coordinate planes. You should also practice calculating the slopes and y-intercepts of different lines. Find out how to solve systems of equations by substitution, graphing, or elimination. You should also work on solving proportions. For public school eighth grade geometry, you may learn transformations. These include the rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations of shapes. For those in a slightly more challenging math course, you will learn algebra 1. [4] X Research source Review things you learned in pre-algebra (solving systems of equations and proportions). Next, learn how to graph quadratic equations and absolute value equations. You may learn additional equations, such as equations with square roots and cubes. Then, understand and memorize the quadratic formula. You'll use this to find the answers to more complicated quadratic equations which you can't find the answers to using factoring. For those in an even more challenging math course, you will learn geometry. [5] X Research source Review things you learned in algebra, such as quadratic equations and solving systems of equations. Next, get to know some basic terms (which you may have touched upon in elementary school) such as lines, segments, points, and rays. Then, memorize important theorems and postulates. These will be important when you learn how to write proofs. You will learn how to prove many things. At the beginning, you may prove how lines are parallel using the Converse of the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem. Next, you may learn important triangle congruence theorems, such as SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, and HL (for right triangles). Then, you may get to proving that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, rhombus, rectangle, or square."

You might learn about dash, hyphen, and comma usage too. Parts of speech such as possessive nouns and clauses may be taught. In writing, you will probably polish your persuasive essay skills. You'll write multiple essays over the course of eighth grade containing a thesis, multiple claims, lots of evidence to support the claims, and explanations detailing why the evidence supports the claim.

For reading, read books with multiple main ideas and motifs. These types of books include The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, Twilight by Stephanie Meyer, Deep Blue by Jennifer Donnelly, Absolutely Normal Chaos by Sharon Creech, and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. [7] X Research source Older books for eighth graders include The Outsiders by S.E.

These topics may be different to what you've learned in earlier middle school. The concepts will be more complex. There will also definitely be more terms to memorize! [8] X Research source For biology, you may learn about genetics and heredity. Review terms like \"Punnett squares\", \"acquired\", \"traits\", \"alleles\", \"dominant\", and \"recessive\". In physics, you may learn about energy transfers and energy transformations (e.g. from kinetic energy to mechanical energy). Heat transfer may also be taught. In chemistry, you may learn different types of elements and chemical bonds. Remember how to identify reactants and products and different chemical reactions. Some schools teach beginner astronomy.

[9] X Research source You may learn about the 18th century in American history. This is the time period when the American Revolution happened. You'll get to see who the important founders of the U.S.A. were (such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson). Some schools teach geography. Get to know where certain countries are on a map. Other schools teach modern world history. This starts from after World War I and extends to the Cold War.

Give yourself enough time to wake up, shower if you need to, get dressed, eat breakfast, and gather your things together before you need to head out the door. In school, make sure to get to class before the late bell rings. This will help you be more responsible which will be helpful when you get to high school. If you know you tend to run late, try setting your alarm for 15 minutes earlier than you normally do to give yourself a little extra buffer.

In middle school, especially a private middle school, you'll need to pay attention to every detail. You don't want to miss some instructions on formatting essays or instructions on doing a project! Even small details count- some strict schools may subtract points off assignments and tests if you miss out on writing small details, like writing the \"m\" next to an angle measure, positive and negative signs, typos, or indenting paragraphs. Ignore people who try to distract you. Your best friends or the class clown may try to distract you by making funny faces, passing notes, tapping your shoulder, or whispering to you. Ignore them, and after class, tell them to stop talking during class, since it distracts you. Avoid talking during class. Sure, it may be really challenging in class to not share a cool story to your friends, laugh at a funny joke, or talk about a dank meme with your friends. But those can wait until after class. Whenever you're about to start a conversation during class, think to yourself, \"I need to pay attention to get a good participation grade.\" Try to pay attention even though people around you are talking.

You may have gotten used to tests every 2 weeks, but in 8th grade and high school, you might have tests weekly or have a lot of tests in the same week. To earn an excellent score on a test, study. Don't study for four hours or the whole night though. That's not useful, since studying for long periods of time will be boring, and your brain will lose concentration easier. Don't try to stuff a ton of information into your short-term memory at once, as this can also make you very nervous and stressed.

If you write down only one example of a math problem using the distance formula, you may be unsure of how to use the distance formula for other types of lines. They won't describe nor summarize all of the small details that you will need to understand.

This is true in middle school, since you have a teacher for each subject instead of one teacher that teaches every subject in your class in elementary school. Your science teacher may have other classes of students to teach or other grade levels to teach- so does your math teacher, history teacher, and language arts teacher. If your school posts all assignments (even ones where you turn in a hard copy) online, check the website your school uses for all of the assignments daily. Check each teacher's classroom's whiteboard for any assignments and tests written on there. Write them down in a planner or notebook. Create binders or folders for each class you will be taking. Get new binders and folders from the store once you know what classes you’ll be taking, and set aside an afternoon to organize and decorate them. Create three different sections for each class: assignments, tests, and notes. This will help you stay organized throughout the school year.

This will waste your time in class, and if you have a busy schedule, you may not have enough time to do classwork and homework at home.

Refrain from doing anything that would get you in trouble, like vandalizing, gossiping, bullying, stealing, or disrupting the class. If you're attending a private high school, do extra by participating more in class and asking questions. Your teacher will know you more if you do this, and subsequently write a longer, more detailed recommendation letter. The high school admissions teams will then look at this letter and decide whether or not to recruit you based on your personality, grades, and character.

It's ok if you are short/look like a 9-year-old compared to your classmates, or if you look like a high schooler at the ages 12-14. People grow up and develop at different rates, but you will still go through puberty at one point or the other. Manage your period. You will need to change your period products every 2-4 hours. Try to change them during breaks or longer class transitions. Bring some pain medication approved by the school if you have cramps. Cite \"female issues\" or drinking too much water if the teacher asks why you're going to the bathroom very often. Get a sports bra. If your breasts are large enough, you may want a sports bra for gym class/PE. They may bounce around and move a lot, so you'll need this item of clothing for them to stay still. For times where you aren't exercising, getting a regular cup bra is fine (if your breasts have developed enough). Hide erections. Males may be shy and embarrassed about this, since these appear during random times, like during PE class, in the classroom, or in the hallways where everyone can see.

You might feel as if making new friends in 8th grade is useless, since they will leave again, and you won't have any friends in high school. This is not the case, as you guys can contact each other online. You may even be going to the same high school, so you should still have a social life in 8th grade. [14] X Research source Speak clearly and make eye contact with others when you speak with them. You’ll appear confident even if you don’t feel that way. Say hi to some lonely kids sitting alone. The ends of elementary, middle, and high school are the hardest to make friends, as everyone else has their old friends they've met many years ago. The 5th graders have their old buddies from early elementary school (4th grade-kindergarten), and the 8th graders have companions from early middle school and elementary school. So, it can be challenging to make friends if everyone else is sticking with their old friends. So, go outside of your comfort zone and talk to some new or lonely kids. This makes their day and lets them feel comfortable at the new school. Try to join in conversations and share your ideas with others. Brush up on your small talk to practice for meeting new people in high school, and try to speak up in class when you know the answer or have ideas of your own. This will help you gain confidence, which is important to having a happy social life because others are drawn to people with confidence. Sit next to some new people at lunch. Talk about what went on during your day. Say something like, \"Algebra class was pretty challenging for me. How was math for you?\" or \"Are you in algebra class or geometry class?

Even though there will be a few mature people in 8th grade, some tweens and teens will still be immature. Try to ignore these immature classmates and try to understand them. If they are very disruptive during class, tell a teacher. Understand that younger people in your class who are just turning 13 will be more immature than people who are older (turning 14). Also, boys go through puberty at later ages than girls, so there will be many boys in your class that are immature compared to girls. When puberty starts, you start mentally maturing, and males are usually slower in doing that. Boys that are early bloomers may go through puberty at ages 10-11 when that may be considered the normal age for puberty in girls. Late bloomers that are boys might start at 14 or 15 when that is considered very late or abnormal in girls. If you're one of the mature kids in your class, you may not understand the silly humor that they talk about, like weird memes, potty humor, and being disruptive in class.
