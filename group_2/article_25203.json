Choose a yarn made from cotton, acrylics, or wool blends depending on your preference. When choosing a wool, Webber says, “Acrylic is great because it’s inexpensive and it’ll hold up well in the washing machine… The care for wool can be more complicated. On the other hand, the wool items will last forever if you can keep moths away from them.” [2] X Expert Source Jen Webber Knitting Specialist Expert Interview. 4 August 2020. You'll use 2.63 ounces (75 g) of yarn for the small hat or 3.44 (97 g) for the large size. This beanie is a great project if you'd like to use up some of your yarn stash since you won't be using the entire skein of yarn."

      "content": "Make a slip knot. Take the yarn that you pulled out and twist the end into a loop that crosses over itself with the tail on top. Pinch the tail end with one of your hands, and slide the index finger and thumb of your other hand under the loop. Pinch the working yarn with these fingers and pull it through the loop to form the slip knot . [3] X Research source If you're unsure whether or not you've made a slip knot, keep pulling. The knot will come undone if you've successfully made a slip knot. If the knot tightens and doesn't come loose, you didn't make a slip knot."

      "content": "Slide the knot onto US 10 1/2 (6.5 mm) needles and cast on 72 or 80 stitches. Take your slip knot and place it on one of the size US 10 1/2 circular needles . Then, pull on the yarn tail to tighten the knot around the needle. [4] X Research source If you’re making a small beanie, cast on 72 stitches, or cast on 80 stitches for a large beanie. Keep in mind that circular needles are usually easier for beginning knitters than juggling 4 or 5 double-pointed needles. Choose circular needles that are 47 inches (120 cm) long. While this might seem really big, the length allows you to bend them so you can make a magic loop. This way, you don't have to use double-pointed needles at all!"

      "content": "Bend the cable in half to divide the stitches between your needles. Slide all of the stitches to the cable that stretches between the needles and find the middle point. Bend the cable so half of the stitches are on one side while the other half are on the opposite side. Then, slide the stitches onto the needles. [5] X Research source This is called the magic loop method and it's the simplest way for beginners to work on projects in the round. This is because you don't have to switch to double-pointed needles at any point. For example, if you're making the small size, slide 36 stitches onto each needle. To make the large size, push 40 stitches onto each needle."

To start working your first round, turn the needles so they're horizontal and hold the needle with the working yarn at the back so it's farther away from you. Slowly pull the back needle away from the stitches and bring it towards you. Insert the tip of this needle into the other needle and make one knit stitch . [6] X Research source To make it easier to count rounds, slip a stitch marker onto this first stitch. Then, move the marker whenever you reach the end of a round. Before you knit the stitch to join the round, check that the working yarn is over the cable and not under it."

This completes one round in a ribbed stitch. [7] X Research source If you'd like narrower ribbing, work K1, P1 for all of the stitches instead of K2, P2."

Work six rounds so you can see the ribbed pattern. Keep a tally on a sheet of paper so you can keep track of how many rounds you've made. You can also find stitch or round counters at craft supply stores. Every time you finish a round, adjust the dial to advance the number so you can always see which round you're working on."

This makes the garter stitch , which is what you'll use to make the body of the hat. [8] X Research source Work the garter stitch until the ribbing and body of the beanie measure 6 3 ⁄ 4 inches (17 cm) long for a small or 7 inches (18 cm) long for a large. To measure, place the end of a ruler at your cast-on edge and measure the length of your knitted fabric. If you want the beanie to be slouchy, knit an extra 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm)."

To start decreasing the large hat, knit six stitches. Insert your needle through the next two stitches and knit them as one to make a K2TOG stitch. [9] X Research source Then, slip two stitches onto the right needle, insert the left needle through them, and make one slip slip knit (SSK) stitch. Knit six stitches and repeat the pattern until you reach the end of the round. The decreasing repeating pattern looks like this: K6, K2TOG, SSK, K6 If you're making the smaller hat, you don't need to work as many stitches, so follow this repeating pattern: K4, K2TOG, SSK, K4"

Then, sew back and forth over the top at least two times before you push the needle to the inside of the hat. Make a simple knot in the yarn inside the hat and trim the thread close to the knot. [13] X Research source You don't need to weave in the excess yarn since the knot and tiny tail are completely hidden."

Then, weave the tail into the stitch that's near the base. [14] X Research source Sew back and forth at least two times to secure the tail to the hat and trim off the excess yarn. Although most beanies don't have pom poms on top, feel free to make a soft pom pom with a long yarn tail. Use the tail to attach the pom pom to the crown of the hat and sew it to the inside of the hat. Adding a pom pom can also cover up any mistakes you may have made if you’re a beginner. Nudelman says, “If you don’t decrease as you’re getting to the top of the hat, you can pull all the stitches together when you’re done, but it’s going to leave quite a large hole, which is why a lot of people will then put pom poms on top. If you don’t want a pom pom, you definitely want to decrease so that you have fewer stitches.” [15] X Expert Source Blythe Nudelman Knitting Expert Expert Interview. 2 April 2024."

      "content": "Beginners can knit beanies, though some patterns may be tricky. Beanies are a relatively easy knitting project involving basic techniques like knit, purl, and decrease stitches. Making a beanie is also a great way to practice skills like knitting in the round and ribbing. However, beanies aren’t as easy to knit as flat projects like scarves , so it may be best to start with something else if it’s your very first knitting project. According to Webber, “Knitting a hat is a great second project. I would like to get some knitting under my belt before I take on a hat.” [16] X Expert Source Jen Webber Knitting Specialist Expert Interview. 4 August 2020. Before you start knitting a beanie, check the pattern to make sure you know how to do all the stitches involved. If you don’t, practice them beforehand! “Learning to knit in the round feels huge, but once you have it, it’s not so bad,” assures Webber.

      "content": "You can knit a beanie with straight needles, but it’s more difficult. While it’s possible to knit a beanie with straight needles , you’ll end up with a flat piece that needs to be sewn together and will have a seam on the side. [18] X Research source You’ll also have to use four or five double-pointed needles to work the hat, so using straight needles is better left for someone with intermediate knitting skills. Using circular needles and knitting in the round is generally much easier. Webber explains that a lot of mistakes are made when sewing a project, “Because people try to sew that seam a little bit too tightly. You want to make sure that your stitches for your hand sewing match the tension of the knitting that you have done. That will help everything align a bit more easily.” [19] X Expert Source Jen Webber Knitting Specialist Expert Interview. 4 August 2020."
