      "content": "Wear cozy sweaters and casual basics like dark jeans and button-ups. To channel Rory’s simple yet stylish look, opt for classic silhouettes and basics that you can easily layer together or mix and match with funkier pieces. For example, you might wear a crisp button-up shirt with dark low-rise jeans and a pair of basic sneakers . During the chillier seasons, choose a chunky and comfy cable-knit sweater and a classic trench coat . [1] X Research source In most cases, Rory dresses fairly casually and doesn’t seem to care much about expensive or designer clothing. So, don’t feel like you need to break the bank to look just like Rory!"

Both of these trendy aesthetics fit Rory’s iconic style and clothing choices to a tee (i.e., Yale- and Chilton-era Rory). Type either of these aesthetics into TikTok or Pinterest for endless inspo on the Gilmore style, or start with these basic must-haves from each aesthetic (and focus on the ones that are most Rory-inspired): [2] X Research source Light Academia: Focused on light, muted, and airy looks that are associated with higher education, classic literature, and art. Wear tweed blazers , pleated skirts , Oxford shoes , and cozy knitwear . [3] X Research source Ivy League Preppy: Defined by clean, classic tailoring with casual elegance and refinement. Focus on having a few high-quality basics with clean silhouettes in neutral tones and natural fabrics. For example, try button-down Oxford shirts , chinos , loafers , and knit sweaters . [4] X Research source The true key to Rory’s style is that she incorporates these preppy, old-money looks without being too formal or buttoned-up! Wear these aesthetics, but make sure to focus on the casual end of their style spectrum."

      "title": "Opt for neutral and autumnal colors.",
      "content": "Opt for neutral and autumnal colors. Rory pretty much exclusively wears neutral shades and autumn-inspired hues, sometimes with pops of blue to highlight her same-toned eyes. When shopping for clothes in your style (or in Rory’s), opt for neutral shades like beige, tan, cream, and white. When you want to wear something a little more colorful, choose autumn shades like maroon, eggplant, forest green, or burnt orange. Then, toss in some navy or cerulean blue from time to time to shake things up! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Accessorize minimally with headbands, scarves, and leggings. Rory dresses pretty minimally, and the same is true for her accessories. She rarely wears anything too bold or funky, but she is known to accessorize with simple items like headbands , barrettes , and delicate necklaces . For a cozier or more cold-friendly look, add leggings, tights, or knee-high socks for a Connecticut-winter-approved style. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Get the classic Rory Gilmore hair with a sleek blowout. Rory sports a few different hairstyles throughout the seven seasons of Gilmore Girls , but her most iconic look is just a simple blowout ! The classic Rory hairstyle features her long, brunette locks worn loose (with perhaps a bit of a curl-under at the ends). This polished yet playful look gives off effortless elegance and it’s truly easy to achieve—you just need to follow these steps for the perfect Gilmore blowout: [7] X Research source Apply a heat protectant to your strands before blow drying . If you have some wave or curl to your hair, apply a product that has some memory to it—like a leave-in detangler or volumizing gel made for curly hair. Blow dry your hair with a medium-to-large round brush, directing the hair dryer downwards for a smoother and sleeker look (alternatively, just use a blow dry brush !). Twist the brush slightly as you reach the ends to achieve Rory’s signature flip. If needed, you can also use a hair curler or hair straightener to flip the ends of your hair inward. Once your hair is fully dry, finish with a light smoothing serum or cream and a light-to-medium hold hairspray . This clean hairstyle is also great because you can accessorize it in a variety of ways. For the most Rory-inspired accessory look, wear a thick headband in your blown-out hair. If you want to switch things up a bit but still look like Rory, pull your hair into a preppy slick-back pony , fashion a half-up style with a clear elastic, curl loose waves into your strands, or cut a set of blunt bangs .

      "content": "Stick to the simple “no-makeup makeup” look perfected by Rory Gilmore. Before TikTok even taught us the phrases “no-makeup makeup” and “ clean girl aesthetic ,” Rory had already mastered the minimalist makeup look! To copy Rory’s natural makeup , start with a glowing, healthy base by following this hydrating skincare routine (or something similar to it): use a gentle cleanser at night, then apply a calming anti-redness toner and/or a hydrating serum . Lock in moisture with a multi-ceramide cream , reviving eye cream , and rich lip mask . [9] X Research source Then, follow these Rory-approved makeup steps for her effortless fresh-faced glow: [10] X Research source Foundation: Use a lightweight, sheer, and glowy foundation that enhances your skin (instead of covering it). Concealer: Spot conceal with a color-correcting concealer and tap it in with your fingers for a natural fish. Blush: Apply a cream blush onto the apples of your cheeks to mimic a youthful glow or a flush from being out in the winter air. Set with a lightweight powder . Brows: Lightly fill in your brows with a soft brow pencil in your natural shade. Eyes: Wash the lids with a neutral pink or brown shadow , subtly blending the shade into the crease for added depth. Add a smudge-free mascara that doesn’t look overly dramatic. Lips: Go for a natural tint with Cherry ChapStick or another nude or pink lip tint . Top with a sheer gloss or balm ."

      "content": "Show off your quick wit and silly sense of humor. Rory has a great sense of humor and is constantly firing off witty quips, sarcastic remarks, and funny jokes. To become wittier , try to brush up on your knowledge—both academic and pop-culture-related—so that you can make a bunch of jokey references in the iconic Gilmore way. You can also watch stand-up routines or funny shows (like Gilmore Girls !) to get the hang of the cadence and pattern behind a quality sense of humor . [11] X Research source Even if you’re not a natural jokester, simply appearing warmer and more friendly can make you seem funnier or more similar to Rory’s character. Smile often, laugh at other people’s jokes, and carry yourself with an open body language ."

      "content": "Be curious about acquiring new bits of knowledge. Rory is an inherently curious person with a genuine love of learning—and she’s not shy to show it off! She’s always looking for ways to learn new bits of information and is quick to ask questions if she’s interested in a subject or wants to know more about something. Try to take a vested interest in the world around you—look beyond the seemingly mundane and think critically about the things you’re experiencing. [12] X Research source When you don’t understand something or want to learn more, ask questions about it!"

      "content": "Embrace responsibility and punctuality. Rory is the definition of a Type A perfectionist, so it’s no wonder that she prides herself on her responsible nature and commitment to punctuality . Set timers and plan ahead so that you always arrive at functions (slightly) early or right on time. [13] X Research source Of course, punctuality is also a huge part of being a responsible individual —which Rory definitely is. To do the same, take on extra responsibilities when appropriate and make sure to honor your commitments. Help others out when you can, and follow through on your word when you give it.

Of course, your passions don’t have to be the same as Rory’s—take the time to explore what your passions truly are , then enthusiastically pursue them and work to excel in your field . Rory, for instance, has a passion for journalism. Even in high school, she puts her all into the student paper and ends up becoming the editor of the Yale University newspaper later on.

      "content": "Prioritize your friendships and platonic relationships. While Rory has her fair share of romantic relationships throughout the show, she also maintains some strong friendships with important people from her childhood. If you don’t already have a Paris or Lane in your life, make it a goal to make some close friends (remember: quality over quantity!) and place a priority on maintaining those connections and spending quality time with those individuals. [16] X Research source Similarly, Rory has close relationships with many older people who aren’t technically family but had a hand in raising her—like Patti, Babette, Luke, and Taylor. If you have family, friends, neighbors, or mentors who have always treated you like one of their own, make sure to prioritize these people as well."

She knows who she is, what’s important to her, and what she likes, and she doesn’t allow for the judgment or expectations of others to change those things. Be true to yourself and honor the things that make you unique—regardless of what anyone else has to say about them. At the end of the day, that’s the best way to be just like Rory Gilmore!"

      "title": "Drink a lot of coffee and treat yourself to sweet breakfasts.",
      "content": "Drink a lot of coffee and treat yourself to sweet breakfasts. If there’s one thing that the Gilmore girls are known for, it’s coffee. Rory clearly inherited her mom’s passion for caffeinated beverages, so she can frequently be seen sipping on a cup of joe at home, at Luke’s Diner, or at a Yale University coffee cart. So, to be more like Rory, start off each day with a cup of coffee at your local café or diner (and we won’t tell if your coffee mug is filled with matcha or hot cocoa instead). [17] X Research source You can’t have coffee without breakfast, of course, and sweet treats are a staple in the Gilmore household. Rory often eats Pop-Tarts for breakfast, which makes sense as they pair perfectly with a cup of black coffee! When stopping at Luke’s Diner for breakfast, however, Lorelai and Rory usually opt for sweet pastries like donuts and danishes (Danish Day!), so those food items are also great options. Keep in mind that—while you should definitely indulge in a sweet treat when you want to— Gilmore Girls is a fictional TV show, and Pop-Tarts aren’t the most nutritious of breakfasts, so you may want to vary your breakfasts or pair your treat with something more substantial like yogurt, fruit, or some scrambled eggs."

If you’re a high school or college student, you can use Rory as a model to study diligently for all of your classes and subjects. Challenge yourself with classes that are more difficult for you, and work hard to keep up with the coursework and learn as much as you possibly can. Here are some other study tips straight from the Rory Gilmore handbook: [19] X Research source Create a study schedule where your study time, reading time, and free time are well-planned out. Include breaks for coffee, movie marathons, and phone time with your BFF! Take notes and create flashcards out of the material you’re learning in class. Review these notes daily and use your flashcards to regularly review and test yourself. Make a cozy and organized study space just like Rory’s by keeping your materials tidy and desk clutter-free. Add in some Stars Hollow vibes with a cozy candle , warm cup of coffee, and a comfy sweater. Seize opportunities for further learning outside of class by reading books about interesting topics, visiting museums and cultural landmarks, and applying to educational programs and internships."

If traveling isn’t in the cards for you just yet, immerse yourself in other cultures through books, movies, and new types of cuisine. [21] X Research source"
