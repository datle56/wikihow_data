You might have been labeled as a boy or a girl when you were born, but feel like you should have been assigned the opposite gender. It's also possible that you don't identify with being a boy or a girl at all or feel like your gender changes fluidly. This might mean you identify as non-binary, gender-queer, xenogender, or gender-fluid. [1] X Research source If you're feeling any of these emotions, it may mean you would like to transition. [2] X Trustworthy Source State of Connecticut Official website for the State of Connecticut Go to source You might be uncomfortable dressing in the clothes that are typically associated with the gender you were assigned at birth. You may feel drawn to spend time with people who are the gender you identify with rather than the one you were assigned at birth. You may feel like you don't identify with the gender binary and would prefer to identify as neither a man nor a woman (non-binary, gender-queer, or xenogender). You might feel like the gender you were assigned at birth sometimes, but you also identify with other genders as well (gender-fluid)."

You might want to wear clothes, participate in activities, and be thought of by other people as a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth. These feelings indicate that you might be ready to start transitioning.

You may be interested in hiding or accentuating different body parts depending on your true gender identity. For example, you might be curious about using a binder to hide your breasts. You might want to reject the concept of binary gender and be referred to by they/them pronouns or neopronouns like ze/hir or xe/xem."

You might feel unhappy or uncomfortable about certain body parts that don't align with your gender identity. You may also feel distressed about being referred to and treated like the gender you were assigned at birth. If you're experiencing this, you might find relief by transitioning. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Gender dysphoria can also manifest in the form of anxiety, depression, self-harming behaviors, eating disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. If you're experiencing symptoms like this, consider seeing a gender therapist. They can give you the tools and resources you need to work through these tough feelings. To find a therapist, search online or get a referral from your doctor. If you don't have access to a therapist right now, try resources online like https://translifeline.org/ or https://www.thetrevorproject.org/ . These organizations offer free 24-hour hotlines, anonymous peer support, and information on finding a counselor. Not every trans person experiences gender dysphoria. It's also completely normal to know that you don't identify with the gender you were assigned at birth but feel comfortable and happy with your body the way it is right now. Reader Poll: We asked 1658 wikiHow readers who've experienced gender dysphoria, and only 8% of them agreed that the best way to cope with it is by doing self-care. [Take Poll] Taking care of yourself is always important, but sometimes the best way to do so is by seeking help from a counselor or therapist."

To start that process, you might consider coming out to your friends and family. [5] X Research source To do that, pick a time when your friends or family are free to talk in private and let them know. You might consider writing a letter or printing out some resources to help you explain how you're feeling and encourage them to understand.

I'm still me, but I want to start living as my authentic gender identity. I'd be happy to talk more about this if you have any questions.\" If you don't feel safe coming out to your family and friends right now, it's totally okay to wait. Coming out is a very personal decision, and when you decide to do it is entirely up to you. Wait to come out until you feel safe, secure, and supported. Consider connecting with a trans community, either in-person or online, if you're not able to come out right now. Try organizations like https://translifeline.org/ , https://www.thetrevorproject.org/ , or https://thesafezoneproject.com/ . You can also connect with the trans community online using message boards like https://www.transgenderpulse.com/forums/ and https://tgforum.com/ .

Pronouns you might consider include she/her, he/him, they/them, or even a combination of the three if you are gender fluid, genderqueer, or non-binary. As you get more comfortable, you might consider asking your classmates, teachers, or colleagues to refer to you as your correct pronouns. [7] X Trustworthy Source State of Connecticut Official website for the State of Connecticut Go to source It's okay if you're still experimenting with what pronouns work for you. Part of the social transitioning process is exploring your gender identity in public, so it's totally fine if you still have questions or are not 100% sure about your identity just yet. If you find that you're often being misgendered at work or school, see if you have any allies that can help correct those people so that you don't always have to. A supportive friend or colleague would be happy to help. You might say, \"I've been having a tough time getting people to use my pronouns.

You also may want to change your grooming habits by growing out your hair or refraining from shaving your legs. Many people also consider things like binding , tucking , or packing to live as their authentic gender identity. [10] X Research source Binding refers to using a tight chest wrap to hide your breasts underneath your clothes. Tucking is the process of hiding your testicles in the inguinal canal and keeping them in place with form-fitting underwear or a gaff (underwear designed for tucking).

      "content": "Undergo hormone therapy (HRT). After transitioning socially, you might feel ready to transition medically. If you're a trans woman, talk to a trans-friendly doctor about taking estrogen and anti-androgens. If you're a trans man, ask about taking testosterone. Genderqueer, non-binary, or gender-fluid individuals can ask about taking the hormones that feel right for them. Depending on your healthcare provider and where you live, you may need a letter of recommendation or a mental health assessment from a therapist to be approved. [11] X Research source [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you're not sure that you want to transition medically, know that that's totally normal and okay. You shouldn't have to change anything about your body for your gender identity to be valid, and many trans people opt out of transitioning medically for their own personal reasons. A trans-friendly therapist will likely be happy to provide a letter of recommendation or a mental health assessment; however, If you're also experiencing severe mental health problems, like psychosis or mania, they may decide to treat those first. If you're under 18, you'll also need parental consent. Though it's difficult to be approved for HRT without this, you do have options. If it's serious that you start your medical transition now and your parents won't approve, you might consider emancipation to legally make your own medical decisions. However, you will have to take some time to make this decision, as it could affect your future. Conditions like hormone-sensitive cancer (i.e. prostate cancer) or deep vein thrombosis might make going on HRT more risky for your health. A doctor can work with you to come up with the hormone therapy plan that's right for you.

As tough as this may be, remind yourself that your identity is valid no matter what you decide. Your health history or financial situation might make medically transitioning difficult or impossible at the moment, or you might not feel the need to undergo medical procedures to affirm your gender identity. There's no right or wrong way to transition, so do what feels right for you. Talk to a doctor about your options if you have underlying health conditions that might affect your ability to transition. Understand the risks of medically transitioning without a medical professional. Transitioning without a doctor (i.e. using hormones you received through non-medical sources) might cause serious problems like blood clots, high blood pressure, and liver damage.

A trans man might think about undergoing a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus, cervix, and sometimes the fallopian tubes), de-feminizing breast reconstructive surgery (removal of the breasts), or facial masculinization surgery. Genderqueer, non-binary, or gender-fluid individuals might consider a combination of these surgeries to help their body match their true gender expression."
