For instance, you might wear sleeveless tops to show off toned arms, short hemlines to display great legs, and low cut tops to show off a well-developed chest. Similarly, you might wear an open button-up shirt or crop top to show off your stomach. If you’re a girl, opt for tight clothing, low cut tops, and short hemlines. For instance, you might wear a body-con tube dress or a crop top with booty shorts. For guys, wear muscle shirts, tight t-shirts, or an open button-up shirt. Additionally, you might wear tight jeans, ripped jeans, or cut offs to flash more skin."
