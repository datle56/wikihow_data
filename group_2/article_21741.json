      "content": "Use simple brackets for instruments you play regularly. While you can always give your guitar a fancier mount, it won't be very convenient if you have to undo a bunch of straps and screws each time you want to play your instrument. Instead, choose simple, padded wall bracket suitable for the type of instrument you have. [1] X Research source The brackets will typically be labeled based on their instrument, such as: guitar bracket. You can find brackets online and in stores that sell musical instruments. Consider getting a bracket with padded, flexible arms. Not only will they protect your instrument, but they will be easier to adjust for other types of instruments."

      "content": "Get a decorative wall mount to suit your room's theme. Wall mounts and brackets for instruments come in all shapes, sizes, and materials. Wooden mounts provide a nice contrast against brass instruments and electric guitars. If you have multiple instruments to hang, consider a mount with multiple brackets. [2] X Research source Some places sell mounts that are carved into novelty shapes, such as electric guitars or mustangs."

      "content": "Try a floating guitar mount for a minimalistic display. Floating mounts are a set of wall brackets made for guitars. The bottom mount holds the guitar up by the bottom strap screw. The top mount holds the guitar up by the neck or by the top strap screw. You can position them horizontally or diagonally. How far apart your screw the mounts into your wall depends on the distance between the 2 strap screws on your guitar. You may be able to use these on other types of string instruments, as long as they have screws for the shoulder strap."

      "content": "Display collectors' instruments in shadow boxes . If you have a valuable instrument, chances are, you are more interested in displaying it than playing it. In this case, purchase a shadow box that fits the dimensions of your instrument. Mount the shadow box on your wall with the instrument inside it. The glass or plastic panel in front of the shadow box will protect your instrument from dust. [3] X Research source A shadow box is a type of frame, except that it is much thicker. If you cannot find one that you like, you may be able to commission it from a frame shop. Most shadow boxes are black inside-out. Consider fitting your shadow box with a colored mat on the inside."

      "content": "Build a case into your wall for a more refined display. This will involve cutting into the wall and inserting a frame, so it is not recommended for rental units. It is a great option, however, if you don't have a lot of space in your room, or if you don't want things sticking out of the wall that could get easily knocked off. [4] X Research source Build the case between wall studs. Line the inside of the case with wood. Paint the inside of the case to match your wall, or try a different color for contrast. Install some lighting inside the case for a more elaborate display. Mount a picture frame with the back removed over the case to protect your instrument."

      "content": "Keep your instruments together in a single room. It would be even better if you group them together on 1 wall. This way, if you ever have friends over and musical inspiration strikes, you don't have to go all over your house and hunt down the instruments. Everything will be all in one place!

If you already have a guitar or two signed by your favorite band, consider getting another instrument that they play signed as well, such as a keyboard or a brass instrument. [6] X Research source"

For example, if you have a collection of string instruments, hang them in order from smallest to largest. Here are some other ideas: [7] X Research source Group instruments by type. This includes acoustic versus electric guitars. Group instruments by color or wood type. Keep different bands separate. This is great if you have different types of instruments from multiple bands."

Other factors you should take into consideration include temperature and humidity; both should be stable. [8] X Research source Some instruments require more humidity than others. Ask your instrument's manufacturer about the proper storage conditions."

      "content": "Keep your instruments away from high-traffic areas. Even if your instrument is slender, such as an electric guitar, it may still be easily knocked off its mount if you place it in a busy location, such as near a doorway or in a hall way. Instead, hang your instruments in an area that receives little foot-traffic. Avoid hanging large, bulky instruments in small, tight spaces, even if they are not busy. If you have to suck your breath in to walk past your instrument, it's not a good spot!"

      "content": "Place the mounting block against your wall. A mounting block is a piece of wood, typically sold with guitar wall brackets; it has 3 screw holes. Make sure that the block is high enough on your wall so that the guitar does not touch the floor when you hang it up vertically. Measure your guitar first, if you have to. Try to place the mounting block over a stud in the wall. Consider using a stud finder to locate the stud."

Rotate the mounting block until the level's bubble is between the guidelines on the glass tube. [9] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. Once the bubble is centered, insert the second screw into the bottom screw hole. [10] X Research source You can use a regular or electric screwdriver for this. Use the screws that came with the guitar mount. If you did not get any screws with it, choose screws that are twice the thickness of the mounting block. Pay attention to the screws as you drill them in. If you feel the screws hit a wall stud, you are good; if you don't feel a stud, you'll have to insert drywall toggles."

Push the drywall toggles into the holes already in the wall, then screw them in the rest of the way. [11] X Research source Once you have the toggles in, replace the mounting block and reinsert the screws. Check the label on the drywall toggles' packaging. Some have a limited weight capacity."
