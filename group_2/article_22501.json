      "content": "Make sure you have enough fabric for a double-folded hem. Curtain hems are folded twice at the bottom, so you will need twice as much fabric for the hem. This means that you will need to cut your curtains longer than you want them to be. The longer the curtain is, the wider the hem needs to be; this will help make it look more proportionate. Standard curtains have a 3 to 4 inch (7.62 10.16 centimeters) wide hem. You'll need to cut your curtains 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) longer than you want them to be. Shorter curtains might look better with a 2 inch (5.08 centimeter) wide hem. Cut your curtains 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) longer than you want them to be. Longer curtains, such as floor to ceiling, might look better with a 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) wide hem. Cut your curtains 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) longer than you want them to be."

      "title": "Fold your bottom up and press it flat with an iron.",
      "content": "Fold your bottom up and press it flat with an iron. How far you fold it up depends on how wide you want your hem to be. For example, if you want a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) wide hem, fold the bottom up by 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). Use sewing pins to hold the fabric in place while you iron it. Be sure to remove the pins when you are done ironing."

      "title": "Fold your hem up again and press it flat with an iron.",
      "content": "Fold your hem up again and press it flat with an iron. Be sure that you are folding it up by the same amount as last time. For example, if you just folded your hem up by 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) earlier, fold it up by that same amount again. Pin the hem in place and press it flat with an iron. You have just folded your double hem."

      "content": "Consider using iron-on hem tape to fuse the hem to the curtain. Cut a piece of hem tape slightly shorter than the width of your curtain. [1] X Research source Slip it inside the hem, right between the back of the curtain and the folded hem. Align the top of the hem tape with the top of the folded hem. Iron the hem down. Press down with the iron for 10 seconds at a time before moving on to the next section. [2] X Research source Most hem tapes will require a wool setting. Different brands will require different settings, however. Refer to the packaging from your hem tape for the proper setting. [3] X Research source To prevent the fabric from burning, consider placing a damp cloth between the iron and the curtain. Some hem tapes have adhesive on one side, and a paper back on the other. You will need to iron it twice: first with the paper backing on, and then with the paper backing peeled off. [4] X Research source You may find hem tape also labeled as stitch-witchery, iron-on hem tape, or fusible fabric tape."

      "content": "Make sure you have enough fabric for a double hem. Standard curtain panels have a 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) wide hem on each side. The hem is folded twice, on both sides, so each panel will need to be 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wider than you want them to be. This will allow you to create a double 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) wide hem on each side."

For example, if your curtain has a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) wide hem, the hem on the lining should be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide. You'll need to cut your lining 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) longer than you want it to be. Curtain linings are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the curtain. Plan accordingly."

      "content": "Undo part of the side hem, if necessary. Curtain linings are usually tucked into the side hem. If you are hemming a store-bought curtain, this could be a problem, depending on how short you are cutting and hemming your curtain. Use a seam ripper to undo the bottom portion of each side hem, and trim the lining down to the length you need. You will tuck it back into the side hems later."

For example, if your hem to be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters), fold it up by 3 inches (7.62 centimeters). If necessary, use sewing pins to hold the hem in place. Be sure to remove the pins once you are done ironing. Make sure that you are folding the hem inside the curtain. You do not want the hem to be visible from the outside. The bottom edge of the lining should rest 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the bottom edge of the curtain when you are done. The bottom edges of the curtain and the lining should not be aligned."

Try to match the original thread color and stitch length as best as you can."
