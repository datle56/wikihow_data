      "content": "Draw a coordinate plane. For a sine or cosine graph, simply go from 0 to 2π on the x-axis, and -1 to 1 on the y-axis, intersecting at the origin (0, 0). Both y = sin ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle y=\\sin(x)} and y = cos ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle y=\\cos(x)} repeat the same shape from negative infinity to positive infinity on the x-axis (you'll generally only graph a portion of it). Use the basic equations as given: y = sin ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle y=\\sin(x)} and y = c o s ( x ) {\\displaystyle y=cos(x)}"

Both y = sin ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle y=\\sin(x)} and y = cos ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle y=\\cos(x)} never go past -1 or 1 on the y-axis. Since you are only hand-drawing your graphs , there is no precise scale, but it must be accurate at certain points."
