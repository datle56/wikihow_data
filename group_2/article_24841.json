      "content": "Pop a batch of popcorn and don't season it. You can pop kernels on the stove or in the microwave, but don't drizzle the popcorn with butter, sprinkle it with salt, or add flavorings. These can make your popcorn soggy or chewy. If you want to eat healthier, prepare your popcorn with water instead of oil."

      "title": "Let the popcorn cool completely.",
      "content": "Let the popcorn cool completely. If you put hot or warm popcorn into a storage container, you'll trap moisture in the container that can make the popcorn become soggy. Ensure that the popcorn is completely cooled before you store it. [1] X Research source Popcorn doesn't take very long to cool. If you're in a hurry, you can spread it out on baking sheets to cool faster."

      "title": "Pack the popcorn into an airtight container.",
      "content": "Pack the popcorn into an airtight container. Once the popcorn has cooled, put it into a glass or plastic container. Try not to use a container that's too large or the popcorn will stale faster. If you can, fill the container to the top so there's not as much air in it. If you don't have a jar or rigid storage container, use a sealable plastic bag. Remove all of the air before closing the bag."

      "content": "Store the popcorn at room temperature for up to 1 to 2 weeks. If you haven't added salt, butter, or seasoning to the popcorn, it will keep for at least 1 week. Avoid refrigerating the popcorn because this will introduce moisture that can make the popcorn stale. [2] X Research source If you're storing leftover store bought popcorn that you made, check it every few days to see if it's still fresh. Since store bought popcorn is already covered in flavoring, it may become chewy within a few days."

    {
      "title": "Flavor the popcorn",
      "content": "Flavor the popcorn just before you eat it. For classic popcorn, toss it with melted butter and salt. If you're feeling more adventurous, melt a little honey with the butter before you drizzle it over. To make savory and spicy popcorn, sprinkle a little chili powder and nutritional yeast over it. The nutritional yeast will give the popcorn a slightly cheesy flavor. [3] X Research source If you don't mind messy popcorn, you can mix the popcorn with caramel or chocolate sauce. To make your seasoned popcorn healthier, use herbal condiments, balsamic vinegar, pickles, or peppers instead of butter, sweeteners, and oils."

Put 2 of the popcorn kernels into the pan and put the lid on. [7] X Research source If you use a pan with a glass lid, you'll be able to see when the kernels pop.
