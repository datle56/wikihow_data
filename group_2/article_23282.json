      "content": "Learn about poison oak. Poison oak is similar to its close relatives poison ivy and poison sumac because they are all members of the same botanical family. The most common type of poison oak, known as western poison oak, grows most commonly along the Pacific coast in Oregon, Washington, and California. It can grow as a small shrub in open spaces or as a climbing vine in shaded forest areas. [1] X Research source Other varieties of poison oak include Atlantic poison oak, which grows in the southeast US. This variety is much less common than the western poison oak.

      "content": "Be careful when examining the plant. A good way to avoid a poison oak rash is to never touch a plant that you think may be poison oak. In order to get close enough to the plant to identify it, use a stick or a gloved hand to examine it more closely. If it turns out to be poison oak, make sure anything that has come into contact with the plant is washed with soap and water."

      "title": "Look at the leaves.",
      "content": "Look at the leaves. Poison oak, whether it is growing as a shrub or a climbing vine, has a trifoliate leaf structure. This means that the leaves grow in sets of threes off the stem. The edges of the leaves have a wavy or scalloped appearance. As the name suggests, the leaves look a bit like oak leaves.

On the underside of the leaf, there is less sheen, less green, and more of a velvety appearance.

      "title": "Learn what causes the rash.",
      "content": "Learn what causes the rash. Both the leaves and the stems of poison oak contain urushiol, an oily plant substance that triggers an allergic reaction in the form of the poison oak rash. Urushiol can also be found in the roots and even in the dead plant. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In addition, urushiol can become airborne if the plant is burned and is easily transported from one object to another. The rash from poison oak is not contagious in the standard sense, but if someone has the urushiol on their hands and touches another person, that second person can react as well. All parts of the poison oak plant contain the toxin urushiol. Even when the leaves fall off in winter, the plant is not safe to touch.
