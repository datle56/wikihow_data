According to makeup artist Cordelia Frost, hooded eyes are a common eye shape that means you can’t see a part of or the entirety of your eyelid creases. People with hooded eyes have excess skin under their eyebrows that naturally folds down to the upper lash line and covers the crease.

Your eye shape is largely determined by your genetics, so for the most part, hooded eyes are something you’re born with and simply a part of your DNA. However, other factors can cause people to develop hooded eyes or experience increased hooding: Aging : Your skin loses elasticity as you get older, so the skin under your brow might start to hang over your eyelid crease. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source People born with hooded eyes often notice the hood dropping further and covering more of their crease as they get older, too. [5] X Research source Fat distribution : Some people may carry more fat around their eye area and under their eyebrows. If they gain weight, they might notice more hooding. Rubbing the eyes : Regularly rubbing your eyes can stretch and weaken the skin, causing it to hang over your eyelid crease.

Hooded eyes are characterized by excess skin under the brow bones that lies over the eye creases, causing them to be partially or fully obscured. On non-hooded eyes, like almond-shaped, round, and protruding, there is no excess skin under the brow and the entire crease is visible. People with hooded eyes often have very little eyelid space between the lash line and crease, while people with non-hooded eyes usually have more visible eyelid space. Both hooded and non-hooded eyes are beautiful—one isn’t more “normal” or “better” than the other. All of the eye shapes have unique features that make them stand out and look beautiful."
