Skipping meals or following fad diet plans won't be effective for long-term maintenance of a trim belly. Ultimately, you'll need to find a healthy diet that you can stick to."

      "content": "Choose lean sources of protein. If you eat meat, stick to lean meat options such as skinless chicken or turkey. Most fish is a good source of lean protein, and also includes Omega-3 fatty acids which are good for your heart. If you eat beef or pork, make sure you stick to lean cuts of meat, and keep your portions small. Trim away all visible fat. [2] X Expert Source Laura Flinn NASM Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Beans lentils, barley, seeds and nuts and other legumes are a great source of lean protein. Adding beans and peas to your soups, salads, and casseroles adds protein without adding the saturated fats that contribute to belly fat. Non-meat sources of protein include prepared meat-substitutes such as tofu, seitan, tempeh, veggie burgers, or tofu-dogs."

      "title": "Limit your use of saturated fats.",
      "content": "Limit your use of saturated fats. Saturated fats to avoid are found in meats and high-fat dairy products such as cheese, milk (and cream), and butter. Some plant-based oils, such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil, also contain high levels of saturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats are a better alternative. Polyunsaturated fats are found in many nuts, seeds, avocados, and some fish. [3] X Expert Source Laura Flinn NASM Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. The over-consumption of saturated fats is directly linked to increase in belly fat, as well as difficulties with insulin regulation. Any type of overconsumption leads to weight gain. Aim for a moderate fat intake and try to replace animal fats with plant of fish oils whenever possible."

      "content": "Avoid sugary foods and beverages. A thick midsection is commonly referred to as a \"beer belly\" for good reason! Overconsumption of sugar in the form of alcohol is a primary culprit in developing belly fat. Sugars found in processed foods, sugary sodas, energy drinks, as well as alcoholic beverages, are a common source of belly fat. To lose your belly fat, stay away from these culprits. [4] X Expert Source Laura Flinn NASM Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Drink water instead of sodas. Carbonated water can make a good substitute. Try squeezing a lemon or lime in your drink for flavor. Fruit juices are loaded with sugar, and don't carry the benefit of fiber that comes with eating the fruit itself. If you're trying to lose belly fat, keep your consumption of fruit juice to a minimum. Switch to plain, unsweetened coffee and teas. A single caf√© mocha (medium sized) contains 11 grams of saturated fat, or 55% of the daily allotment recommended by the ADA."

Try measuring your portions to make sure you're being consistent. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be especially careful of empty extra calories such as white breads and bread products, pasta and white rice. Restaurants often serve large portions. Instead of cleaning your plate, get a take-away box to go. Eating from smaller plates and bowls allows your portions to look larger, even if they're smaller."

      "content": "Stay hydrated. Drinking water throughout the day may help you from feeling hungry, which will help with weight control. A glass of water before meals has been shown to help people eat less. The exact amount of water you should consume depends on your own personal chemistry. The color of your urine will show you if you're dehydrated: if it's dark, you should be drinking more water. Water is also found in plenty of foods, particularly melons and other moist fruits. Flavor your water with fruits, such as watermelon, strawberry or lime. Or fill an ice tray with coconut water, freeze it, and then pop a coconut ice cube or two into your fresh water glass for some extra flavor."

      "title": "Eat more slowly.",
      "content": "Eat more slowly. Eating more slowly encourages smaller portion sizes, and allows you to feel fuller faster. Because your brain takes about 20 minutes longer than your stomach to recognize that it's full, eating slowly allows you to recognize when you're full. You'll eat less, and feel more satisfied at the end of your meal. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source When you eat too quickly, you don't allow the complex communication between your brain and your belly to connect, and are more likely to overeat. If you're trying to lose weight, simply taking more time to chew each bite, and allow your mouth to be completely empty between bites, may help."

Because you're making a lifestyle change, make sure you find an exercise program that works for you. Moderate exercise works best. To know if your exercise rate is moderate, see if you can talk while exercising. If you can talk, you're exercising at a moderate rate. If you can loudly sing a favorite song, you should move more quickly."

      "content": "Try weight lifting. Strength training, which includes weight lifting, stomach crunches, etc. builds lean muscle mass. Because muscles burn more calories than fat does, your body will use calories more efficiently. Doing strength training at least three days per week, paired with moderate aerobic exercise, has been connected to losing belly fat. [8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Exercises that firm and tone the stomach muscles will not eliminate belly fat by themselves. In fact, stomach crunches have little effect on the fat that's carried around the belly. You don't have to belong to a gym to do strength training or weight lifting. You can follow a video at home. Simple body weight exercises like the plank, push ups, lunges, the bridge, squats, calf raises, and arm circles all build muscle.

      "content": "Reduce your stress through yoga or meditation. Stress triggers release of the hormone cortisol, and cortisol both reduces muscle mass and increases the accumulation of belly fat. You'll likely decrease your belly fat by engaging in meditation, because you'll lower your stress level. Doing guided meditations, mindfulness meditations, or yoga serve to decrease your stress levels. [9] X Research source You should never feel sharp, stabbing pain when doing yoga. Stretch only as it feels good to you. Consider taking a meditation or yoga class to help you learn the basics of yoga postures."

Having enough sleep has benefits for your overall well-being: your mood will be better, your stress level lower, and your attention will improve.

[12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don't worry so much about the scales when you're trying to lose belly fat. The changes you're making will replace fat with muscle, which weighs more, so you're likely to notice changes in the way your clothes fit before you notice changes on the scale.

Don't attempt to lose weight right away. If you lose weight too soon, it can take longer for your body to recover from childbirth.
