      "content": "The 🤭 emoji represents cheeky or mischievous laughter. You might use the 🤭 emoji to laugh at something—especially if it’s something the other person said. You can also use 🤭 if you’re telling a story about wanting to laugh at something funny but needing to hold in your laughter, instead. [1] X Research source For example: Omg I wanted to laugh during that presentation so bad!! Had to cover my mouth to get through it 🤭” “Just watched the comedy special you recommended. So funny!! 🤭😂” You might also get this emoji from a girl (or guy) who's crushing on you if they're trying to be coy!"

      "content": "The 🤭 emoji conveys coy embarrassment about something. If you did something silly or mildly embarrassing without meaning to, using the 🤭 emoji is a bit like playfully saying, “Oops!” The 🤭 emoji can be a fun way to acknowledge something embarrassing without taking it too seriously either. [2] X Research source “I may or may not have burped loudly on my blind date tonight, lol! 🤭” “Sooo, I think I grabbed your earbuds by mistake. 🤭 Oops! I can return them today.”"

      "content": "The 🤭 emoji depicts seeing something shocking. After seeing something unexpected, the 🤭 emoji can help show someone that you were totally lost for words! Because it has crinkled, smiling eyes, this usually applies to positive things—but you could use it to describe any kind of shocking situation. [3] X Research source “I got a raise out of nowhere today! Still kind of shocked, but so excited! 🤭” “My cat figured out how to climb the bookshelf! I was surprised, but tbh, it’s hilarious to watch! 🤭”"

      "content": "The 🫢 emoji conveys a feeling of shock and surprise. Like 🤭, the 🫢 emoji also represents shock—although it’s generally more serious. It can also be used to express concern, as though you’re saying, “Oh, my!” without words. However, it ultimately applies any kind of shock or astonishment. [4] X Research source “I can’t believe it! 🫢 Someone just told off the boss in this meeting!” “You’re feeling sick? Oh no! 🫢 You seemed fine yesterday…”"

[5] X Research source “Don’t worry, your secret is safe with me! 🫢” “Can we chat about something else? I promised Liv I wouldn’t talk about that without her. 🫢”"
