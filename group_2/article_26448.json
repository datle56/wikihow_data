      "content": "Take in fewer calories than you burn in a day. That's the whole secret to weight loss. And while the theory may be simple, the practice is really hard. One pound is equivalent to 3,500 calories. To lose 10 pounds in seven days you'll need to lose about 1.4 pounds, or burn about 5,000 calories each day.

Go to source Know that you will need to exercise a lot in order to burn 10 pounds in one week. Starving yourself is not an option. In fact, starving yourself makes weight loss harder, especially after you're done with your diet. [2] X Research source Remember that you'll be burning calories while doing daily activities such as walking around, walking up stairs , and even breathing. It won't be many calories, but you don't have to expect to burn all your calories doing hard exercise."

That's not meant to discourage you; it's only as a reminder of how hard losing 10 pounds in a week actually is. Prepare yourself for a tough, tough journey! Just to give you bit of an idea about how much that is, consider this: a 160 pound person burns about 1,000 calories playing competitive soccer for 90 minutes.

      "content": "Understand that the average person burns about 2,000 - 2,500 calories a day. [5] X Research source This means that if you consume exactly 2,000 - 2,500 calories in food every day, your weight will stay the same — you won't gain or lose weight. If you're trying to lose weight, as you probably do, a healthy person should consume at least 1,200 calories per day, regardless of what their diet is. If you eat 1,200 calories, you'll have about 4,000 calories to burn a day to meet your goal."

      "content": "Drink water only. Water is the dieter's best friend. Sweet, sugary, or caffeinated drinks are the enemy of the dieter. A simple sweet \"energy\" or \"sports\" drink can be as much as 400 calories. That's a third of your total calories for the entire day . Stay away from any drink but water, with one exception. Unsweetened green tea is acceptable to drink, on occasion. If you're sick and tired of drinking just water day in and day out, the occasional green tea is fine. Green tea has lots of antioxidants and 0 calories, which makes it fine to drink. If you're really hungry during meals, down a nice big cup of water right before you eat. This will help trick your stomach into thinking that you're more full than you actually are, making you less hungry."

In addition to cooking everything in trans fat, fast food burgers, fries, and shakes (or burritos, mac 'n' cheese, or sandwiches) are whoppers when it comes to salt and sugar. They are essentially empty carbs, with no real nutrients to them. If you're serious about shedding those pounds and getting your weight back on the right path, you'll stay away from fast food."

Eat early on to jump-start your metabolism and give you enough energy to last comfortably until lunch, and then for dinner begin to wind down and eat the smallest meal of the day. Here are some examples of meals you could cook for yourself during the day, with one snack in between: Breakfast: egg-white omelet with spinach and chicken breast, along with a banana and some fresh blueberries. Lunch: leftover salmon steak over quinoa , with a small salad Snack: handful of pistachios Dinner: bok choy, carrot, mushroom, and pepper stir-fry Some foods that help you lose weight or have fewer calories are: peanut butter rice cakes berries green vegetables green tea water Greek yogurt unsalted nuts almond milk"

Creating a calorie journal and writing in it consistently will help you know when you've gone over your limit. It will tell you what foods worked when and whether they tasted good. It will give you a record of your struggles, which are always fun to look back on after the pain has passed! Get very good at calorie counting and serving sizes. It'll be tough to calculate everything in the beginning, but after a while it'll seem like second-nature. Be religious about estimating how many calories are in a certain food or meal. Be accurate! Lying to yourself isn't worth it if the only one you're hurting is you ."

Walk there. Look at each walking opportunity as an opportunity to burn more calories and to get fitter. Get a pedometer . A pedometer will keep track of the number of steps you take during the day, and you can hide it on your hip so that no one can see it. A good pedometer will convert the number of steps taken into calories burned. They're worth it!"

Warming up and stretching will help you get the most out of your exercise. Plus, who can exercise when they're injured? Examples of warm up exercises include: 20 push-ups , 20 sit-ups, and 20 burpees. (Burpees are when you jump in the air then drop down do a push-up and repeat.) Running in place intensely for 1 minute, and then switching to 1 minute of light jogging in place. Touch your toes, stretch your arms in tandem, get those quads and hamstrings loosened, and don't forget your torso and neck."

      "content": "Try interval training. Interval training is where you do really intense activity for only a short period of time, and then moderate or light intensity work for the majority of the time. Scientists have found, in several studies, that people who do interval training actually end up exercising for shorter periods of time and burning more calories than people who go at medium intensity for their whole workout. An example of interval training would be this: while running around the track, go as hard/fast as you can for one whole lap, then jog at light speed for the remaining three laps. Every four laps is a mile. Feel — and love — the burn."

You may be thinking: I'm not good at any sports , or I'm not comfortable doing any sports . Just remember that people respect other who try hard and who respect themselves. If you think doing soccer, basketball , or swimming would be fun and keep you engaged, then go for it. Let your competitive streak burn the calories for you."

Try out the following cardio machines and see which ones work best for you: Treadmill . The treadmill might actually feel worse than free running, but it's definitely better than nothing. Try to find a nice, fast pace that keeps you sweating. Elliptical. You can set a different resistance strength for most ellipticals, making this a good strength training/cardio dual workout. Stationary bike. If you take a spinning class, get ready to have your butt kicked. Spinning class on the stationary bike is a great way to lose weight."

Cross-training regimes like Crossfit may not be the best at burning a lot of calories very quickly (they're better at replacing fat with lean muscle), but it's worth trying out.

What about a dance class at your local Y? You could try something like basic jazz or pop or hip-hop classes if you're familiar already and you find the dance moves or music comforting. You could also try something like zumba, which combines Latin and international music into one fantastic workout. Zumba, like regular dancing classes, is taught by a dance instructor."

Better pick a couple exercises that you really like, because chances are you'll be doing a lot of them in order to burn 10 pounds in a week. You might want to set aside 4 hours a day in order to exercise: 2 2-hour sessions, broken up in the middle with a break. If you need any motivation, just thinking of all the weight you're saying goodbye to and the fabulous body that you'll be welcoming in no time flat. Good luck!"
