      "title": "Chop the mangoes",
      "content": "Chop the mangoes into 1 in (2.5 cm) chunks. To cut a mango, slice the flesh away from the seed in the center of the fruit. Score the 2 pieces with the most mango flesh into a grid and scoop the fruit out with a spoon. Then, carefully use a small knife to trim off the fruit surrounding the seed. You should get around 5 cups (525 g) of mango chunks. [1] X Research source Ensure that there's no peel on any of the chunks. You may need a different number of mangoes depending on the size and variety of mangoes. For example, Alphonso mangoes are smaller, so you might need a few more of them."

      "title": "Put the chunks into a blender with water or milk and the optional sugar.",
      "content": "Put the chunks into a blender with water or milk and the optional sugar. If you'd like the flavor of the mango to really shine, pour 4 cups (950 ml) of water into the blender. If you prefer a creamier drink, you could use milk instead. You can also add 3 tablespoons (36 g) of sugar if you want the mango juice to be even sweeter. [2] X Research source Try substituting coconut milk for the water or milk if you'd like another non-dairy option. You can use your favorite sweetener, such as honey or agave, or leave out sweetener altogether if the mangoes are very sweet."

      "title": "Blend",
      "content": "Blend the juice for 30 seconds or until it's smooth. Put the lid on the blender and combine the ingredients until the mango is completely pureed. Keep blending until the mango incorporates with the water or milk. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the juice through a strainer if you want thin mango juice.",
      "content": "Pour the juice through a strainer if you want thin mango juice. If you used mangoes that had noticeable fiber strands, you may want to strain the juice. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a pitcher or measuring jug and pour the mango juice into it. The juice will drip into the pitcher, leaving the pulpy fibers in the strainer. [4] X Research source Discard the pulp once you've finished straining the juice. If your mangoes were smooth or you don't mind thicker juice, you can skip straining it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the mango juice into serving glasses.",
      "content": "Pour the mango juice into serving glasses. If you'd like your juice to be cold, place a few ice cubes in each glass before you pour the mango juice into them. Consider sticking an extra sliver of mango on the side of the glass before serving the drinks and enjoy! [5] X Research source You can cover the pitcher of mango juice and refrigerate it for up to 2 days. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can add to the juice to extend its storage time. For longer-term storage, consider freezing the juice for up to 4 months."

      "title": "Add other juices to make a mango juice cocktail.",
      "content": "Add other juices to make a mango juice cocktail. Mango pairs well with other fruit, so you can mix the prepared mango juice with equal parts of your favorite juice. Try using any of these juices: [6] X Research source Pineapple Peach Orange Apple Cranberry"

      "title": "Include ginger or mint to add a bright flavor.",
      "content": "Include ginger or mint to add a bright flavor. If you like slightly spicy mango juice, peel and thinly slice about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fresh ginger and add it to the blender before you mix the mango juice. To add an herbal flavor, you could put a small handful of fresh mint instead. [7] X Research source Play around with adding other fresh herbs. You could use different varieties of basil, such as lemon basil or spicy basil."

      "content": "Stir in plain yogurt to make a mango lassi . Blend 1/2 cup (120 g) of yogurt with 1 cup (240 ml) of the prepared mango juice and 2 ice cubes. To sweeten the lassi, you could blend in around 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar or honey. [8] X Research source Substitute soy yogurt for a non-dairy mango lassi. Use flavored yogurt if you like an even sweeter lassi. Try mango, strawberry, peach, or vanilla yogurt, for instance."

      "content": "Mix the mango juice with lemonade to make tangy mango lemonade. If you like tangy mango juice, stir equal parts of lemonade with the prepared mango juice. Taste the mango lemonade to see if you'd like to stir in sweetener, such as honey or simple syrup. [9] X Research source To play around with flavors, try mixing the mango juice with limeade."

Create a healthy mango smoothie by adding around 1 cup (175 g) of fresh fruit, such as strawberries, bananas, peaches, or blueberries to the blender with the mango juice ingredients. If your blender is strong enough, you could even add sliced carrot, kale, or spinach! [10] X Research source To make the mango smoothie even creamier, add 1/2 of an avocado."
