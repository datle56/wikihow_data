      "title": "Adjust the machine so your knees are just behind the pad.",
      "content": "Adjust the machine so your knees are just behind the pad. Glute ham developer (GHD) machines can typically be adjusted to accommodate people’s different leg lengths. Slide the foot plate backward or forward until you can kneel on the machine with the balls of your feet pressed firmly into the foot plate and your knees slightly behind the rounded pad in the middle of the machine. [1] X Research source If the foot plate is too close to the machine, your knees will be toward the top of the pad, and the exercise will put too much tension on your knees. [2] X Research source If the foot plate is too far away, you won’t be able to kneel on the machine."

      "title": "Kneel on the machine with your torso straight up.",
      "content": "Kneel on the machine with your torso straight up. Press your toes into the foot pad and your knees into the back of the rounded knee pad. Lift your torso so you create a straight line from your shoulders all the way down through your knees, with your spine neutral and your core engaged. [3] X Research source Keep your feet straight up and down—don’t turn your toes out. Rotating your feet outward will take pressure off of your hamstrings, so the move won’t be as effective. Cross your arms over your chest, place your hands on your hips, or leave your arms straight down by your side."

      "title": "Lower yourself by extending your knees until your torso is horizontal.",
      "content": "Lower yourself by extending your knees until your torso is horizontal. Use a smooth, controlled motion and hold yourself steady with your glutes and hamstrings—don’t just fall forward. As you straighten your knees, they’ll move up and over the rounded knee pad. [4] X Research source Keep your core tight, inhaling as you go down. If you’d like, you can hinge at the hips and continue past parallel at the bottom of the move—you’ll get a more complete hamstring extension, but it may be harder to lift yourself back up. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings to pull yourself up.",
      "content": "Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings to pull yourself up. Exhale and press your feet back into the foot plate and tighten your hams and glutes to lift your torso until you’re upright again. Don’t arch your back, and keep your core tight. When you finish, you should be back in the starting position. [6] X Research source The biggest mistakes people make with a GHR is to lift with momentum or lead with their back on the way up. This puts too much strain on your lower back and raises your risk of injury. It also makes the workout less effective."

      "title": "Do 3–4 sets of 5–8 reps.",
      "content": "Do 3–4 sets of 5–8 reps. This is a challenging exercise, so it’s okay if you can’t do a complete set to start with—just do as many reps as you can while maintaining good form. As you build up strength, progress to being able to do 5–8 reps at a time. Rest for a few seconds, then repeat for a total of 3–4 sets. [7] X Research source For most people, just working up to more reps should be challenging enough."

      "content": "Hook 2 resistance bands high up on something sturdy. Choose bands that are long enough to come down to about your armpits with minimal tension. Just be sure that they’re looped to something that will stay stable during the exercise, like a squat rack. [8] X Research source If you choose something that isn’t secure enough, it could flip over and injure you."

      "content": "Kneel with your torso upright and your feet under a bar. Hold a resistance band in each hand and face away from whatever the resistance bands are hooked to, and slide your feet under something that will hold them securely. For instance, if the resistance bands are looped around a squat rack, place your feet under the bar of the rack. [9] X Research source It’s a good idea to place a mat or folded towel under your knees for cushion. Hold the bands around your armpits so they go up and over your shoulders."

As you lower yourself, make sure your hips stay locked—don’t hinge them. [10] X Research source Go all the way down to the floor, or as low as you can while still controlling your form. Brace your core for stability."

Then, put your hands on the bars of the GHD machine and push yourself back up until your torso is vertical. [12] X Research source Focus on going slowly on the eccentric part of the move (the part where you lower yourself). This will help you build strength in your glutes and hamstrings so you can eventually complete the move without your hands."

Lower yourself until your chest touches their arm, then lift yourself back up. As you get stronger, your partner can lower their arm, until you can eventually do the move on your own. [13] X Research source Alternately, you can ask a spotter to push you up from the bottom of the move. [14] X Research source"

Hold the band in front of your chest with both hands and try the GHR again. [15] X Research source The resistance band will help take some of the weight off of your hamstrings at the bottom of the move, which may make it easier. As you progress, move to a lighter band, and eventually no band at all."

      "title": "Change the angle.",
      "content": "Change the angle. You can make glute ham raises more difficult by moving the foot plate closer to the knee pad. If your GHD machine has a foot pad with an adjustable height, raising the foot pad can also make the move harder. [19] X Research source If you can’t raise the foot pad on your GHD machine, you can prop the back of the machine up on something sturdy like a wooden board."

[20] X Research source They’re especially good at putting your hamstrings through a full range of motion, which can be difficult to accomplish with other moves. [21] X Research source GHRs also work your core, since you have to stay braced through the entire move."

It can be hard to work your entire posterior chain at once—exercises that work your hamstrings may not work your quads, for instance. This can lead to muscular imbalances that can make you more prone to knee, hip, and back injuries. Glute ham raises can help correct these imbalances. [22] X Research source"

Grab the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing you) and lift it so it rests at the top of your thighs. Then, brace your core and push your hips backward to lower the bar as far as you can without bending your knees. [27] X Research source Personal trainer Laila Ajani says, “Romanian deadlifts are isolation exercises that target your hips.”"

Kneel on a folded towel or a mat and have a partner hold down your feet. Lower yourself slowly to the ground, then squeeze your hamstrings and glutes to lift yourself back up. [28] X Research source This gives you a similar result as GHRs, but you may not get quite as much hamstring extension. Personal trainer Danny Gordon recommends, \"If you’re a beginner, start with 12–15 reps of hamstring curls. Don’t go completely to fatigue—just to where you’re capable of doing it with good form.”"

Hold a barbell on your upper back, across the back of your shoulders, then push your hips back and lean forward until your chest is parallel to the floor. Keep your back flat and your core engaged, then push yourself back up to standing. [29] X Research source Good mornings are another great way to work your posterior chain."

      "title": "Back extension",
      "content": "Back extension Set up the way you would for a glute ham raise, but move the foot plate back so the pads are under your hips. Then, instead of sitting up with your torso vertical, fold down at the hips so your head is hanging down toward the floor. Then, tighten your glutes and hamstrings to lift yourself up to parallel. [32] X Research source This move puts less strain on your hamstrings, so it’s less challenging for beginners."
