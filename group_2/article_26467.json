At meals, fill 1/4 of your plate with lean protein. Additionally, snack on protein sources like low-fat dairy and nuts. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To make sure you’re getting enough protein, figure out how much you need. Aim to consume about 1.2-1.6 grams of protein per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of body weight per day. Spread your protein throughout the day by eating about 25-30 grams of protein per meal. For example, if you weigh 120 kg (260 lb) you would need somewhere between 144-192 grams of protein per day if you want to try a high protein diet. Make sure this diet will fit well with your daily caloric goal, as well. Stick to lean protein choices as these foods also contain fewer calories. This includes skinless poultry, lean beef or pork, seafood, legumes, tofu , low-fat dairy, eggs, beans, lentils , seeds (like hemp and chia ), and nuts. You can even count some grains as a serving of lean protein, such as buckwheat, amaranth, and quinoa."
