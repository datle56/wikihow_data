      "title": "Purchase a piercing needle in sterile packaging.",
      "content": "Purchase a piercing needle in sterile packaging. Look for a hollow piercing needle or catheter needle. A piercing needle is just a hollow metal needle (more common in the U.S.), while a catheter needle has a bit of hollow plastic tubing attached (usually used by pro piercers outside the U.S.). You can buy these needles online or from a body jewelry or tattoo supply store. Common sizes for cartilage piercings are between 16- and 18-gauge. Keep in mind that the lower the gauge number, the larger the needle will be. So, a 16-gauge needle is thicker and will create a larger hole than a 17-gauge one. Don’t try to pierce your cartilage with a push pin, sewing needle or a piercing gun! Doing so could lead to an infection or do more damage to your ear. Piercing needles are sharper, and are specially designed to create a clean hole through your skin and cartilage that’s just the right size for your ear jewelry. [7] X Research source Buy piercing needles that are made for single use. Using a needle more than once can increase your risk of infection. [8] X Research source Some piercing needles are designed so you can slide or screw the post of your jewelry into the end of the needle. This allows you to guide the post directly into the new piercing hole as you pierce your ear, which is a little less traumatic than pushing the jewelry through the fresh piercing after the fact."

      "content": "Get an earring that’s 1 gauge size smaller than your needle. That means the gauge number should be slightly higher , since a higher number means a smaller gauge. For example, if you’re using a 17-gauge needle, you’ll want to get an 18-gauge earring. [9] X Research source This will help ensure that the earring fits easily into the hole. Go for an earring that’s designed to work in an initial cartilage piercing. These earrings should be internally threaded (meaning that the backing should screw into the post of the earring instead of the other way around) or threadless (meaning that the backing clicks into place instead of having to be screwed in). [10] X Research source Make sure the earring is made of a material that’s hypoallergenic and won’t cause irritation. Some good options include titanium, surgical steel, niobium, platinum, and gold that’s 14k or higher. Check that your jewelry is nickel and cadmium-free. Purchase jewelry that’s already sterilized. You can get pre-sterilized, pre-packaged jewelry online or at a body jewelry store. Unfortunately, there’s no good way to properly sterilize jewelry at home unless you own an autoclave."
