      "content": "This fire-earth pairing can learn a lot from one another. As a fire sign, Aries likes to live life with their foot on the gas pedal, while earth-bound Taurus prefers to stay at a steady speed. This doesn’t have to be a bad thing, though—bold, fiery Aries can encourage the Taurus to explore new horizons, while grounded Taurus can help Aries stay focused and driven on the path ahead.

      "content": "Communication is key in this headstrong relationship. Taurus is a “fixed,” stubborn sign—it’s hard to get them to move unless they really want to. Meanwhile, Aries is a direct, straightforward sign that isn’t afraid to face challenges head-on. Without proper communication, it’s hard for these signs to stay on the same page. Compatibility Tip: Compromise is essential! Let’s say Taurus and Aries are deciding what to do on a Friday night. Instead of fighting, they could reach a compromise: Taurus might join Aries for a couple of hours downtown, while the pair can wind down their evening with a movie night and plenty of snacks. Reader Poll: We asked 826 wikiHow readers what the most negative traits in Taureans are, and 56% of them said stubbornness and resistance to change. [Take Poll] So, if you're a stubborn Taurus, be aware that others don't always appreciated that trait."

      "title": "Both Aries and Taurus love to get physical.",
      "content": "Both Aries and Taurus love to get physical. Tauruses aren’t known for being “sexual,” but they are known for being sensual in a touchy-feely sort of way. Taurus loves to get intimate, as does Aries—needless to say, you won’t have any trouble coaxing this ram and bull into the same paddock. Aries tends to have a more direct, straightforward view on intimacy, while Taurus views it as a multi-faceted, pleasurable affair. Sensual Taurus tends to treats sex as a journey toward pleasure, while Aries views it as a singular moment. Aries approaches life in a direct and straightforward way. It makes sense that they’d have the same philosophy toward sex! Compatibility Tip: Make intentional time for sex, rather than doing it in the spur of the moment. Aries might benefit from a slower, more passionate love-making session, while Taurus might benefit from clearly vocalizing their needs and wants in the bedroom."

      "content": "Aries expresses love more directly, while Taurus is more subtle. For better or for worse, Aries has a natural courageousness to tell someone how they feel. They cannot hold things back or keep things secret for very long. An Aries is more likely to verbally share their love, while Taurus might show their affection by preparing a tasty home-cooked meal or by doing their partner’s laundry for them. Few signs are as straightforward as Aries. So, it isn’t difficult at all to know what Aries is feeling at any given time. Taurus is way more subtle about their feelings, and may not understand or vibe with Aries’s intensity. Compatibility Tip: Take time to sit and talk about how you’re feeling. Aries tends to have a direct, me-first kind of attitude. With this in mind, give Aries plenty of time to air out exactly how they’re feeling and why. Sensual Taurus prefers are a more hands-on approach in these situations, and may be more comforted by a hug than an emotional discussion."
