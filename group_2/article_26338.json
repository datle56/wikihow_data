      "content": "Highlight the eyes by using eye shadow heavily. Her blue-green-gray eyes are one of Adriana's most memorable features, and she usually uses pretty heavy makeup to bring them out. The key is to use shades of peach, black, and browns on the eyelid and under the lower lash line as well in the corner of the eye. Take a pretty gray eye shadow. Sweep that under your brow area and on the inner corner of your eyes. It's her eyes that she's remembered for most. Sweep a darker brown eye shadow on your lids. Add some bronze eye shadow in between the brown and white eye shadow on the lower eye. Add blue contacts to look more like Adriana if you don't have eyes her color. The final eye shadow is black. Put that on top of the brown, but let the brown peak up from the corners. [1] X Research source"

She does not have dramatic lips, almost always favoring nude or pink shades of lipstick or lip gloss. Her trick is to emphasize the eyes, while downplaying the lips. Her top lip is smaller than her fuller lower lip. Sometimes she takes a little red or pink lipstick and dabs it on her lips and cheek to give it a slightly tinted but natural look. Use browner blush and brush it on the hollows of your cheek bone. Brush it on your temples too. It will make your face slimmer."
