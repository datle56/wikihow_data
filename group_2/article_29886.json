      "content": "Measure 60 grams potassium nitrate and 40 grams (1.4 oz) of sugar. If you don't have any weighing scales, don't worry, the ratio is 3 parts of potassium nitrate to 2 parts sugar, so you can just use a tablespoon or use the small spoons found in baby formula milk (e.g. Cow and Gate, Optamil)."

      "content": "Stir continuously, but not vigorously, to prevent the material from burning. After about 10 minutes, you will notice that the powder starts to flow a bit like water. This happens because the sugar is caramelizing."

      "content": "Wait for the sugar to caramelize. After few minutes, brown lumps will start to appear. After another few minutes, the whole mixture will turn brown and will go all soggy,a bit like peanut butter. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the mixture off the stove and pour it onto foil or into a cardboard tube. It is really important that you take it off when it looks like peanut butter, otherwise it will turn chocolate-y, and eventually start to burn. [3] X Research source To make a tube for your smoke bomb, just get a toilet paper tube and tape the bottom using electrical tape or duct tape. Clean your pan. A good thing to do would be to get a lighter and set any remaining bits on fire to make sure that the batch will work."
