Plus, you can even add some other flirty incentives to keep him resting. “I know you have a lot on your plate, but make sure you get some sleep today. Sweet dreams!” “Work can wait until tomorrow (or the next day).

      "content": "Let your boyfriend know you’re there for him in any and all ways. Being sick takes a lot out of you and makes doing daily tasks seem impossible, and sometimes, asking for help can be hard. So, reach out and let him know you’re available to pick up any slack, whether that’s cleaning his apartment, walking the dog, or running a quick errand. [3] X Research source “I can come over and pick up the dogs! I’ll gladly take them on a walk while you rest.” “Placing an order for Walmart. What’ll make you smile?

      "content": "Give your boyfriend plenty to watch to keep him occupied. Days can stretch on and on without something to watch when you’re sick. The only thing worse than not having anything to watch is not enjoying anything you turn on. Send over a short list of series or films he might like.
