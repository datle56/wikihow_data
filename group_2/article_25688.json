The following are ways that people learn to drive traffic. Practice creating and promoting fan pages and groups on Facebook. If you know how to get \"likes,\" then you are on your way to driving traffic to a lead landing page. This usually takes a passion for staying in touch with followers and trying new creative social media strategies. Practice creating videos and YouTube channels.

You will need to subtract the cost of the ad in order to figure out your return on investment. Become adept at using PPC advertising to get traffic to your landing page. Similar to buying ad space, you will need to bid on keywords in order to place the link to your landing page where you will get noticed.
