      "content": "Use your iPhone's hotspot to get Wi-Fi easily on the go. To activate your hotspot in your car, click Settings, followed by Cellular and Personal Hotspot. Then, press Allow Others to Join. After, you can connect other devices to your phone's Wi-Fi hotspot in your car. If you're using a phone/tablet, visit Settings, followed by Wi-Fi. Then, click the hotspot option listed as one of the available networks to join. If you're using a laptop, click the Wi-Fi icon, locate the hotspot option on the list of networks, and join. [1] X Research source Pros: This method requires no extra installation and can allow multiple people to tether to your connection. If your phone is fully charged, your connection can even last a few hours. [2] X Research source Cons: Not all plans come with a hotspot. The option uses up your phone's battery life and data (and the latter can cost you money). The connection may weaken if you're making calls or tethering many phones at once."

      "title": "Android hotspots give you Wi-Fi access when you're on the move.",
      "content": "Android hotspots give you Wi-Fi access when you're on the move. First, visit Settings and click Network and Internet (Samsung users, click Settings followed by Connections). Then, press Hotspot and Tethering. At the top of the screen, click Wi-Fi Hotspot (on some phones, it will be called Mobile Hotspot). Then, click the toggle to pick a name and password for your hotspot. Then, connect other tablets/phones by visiting your Wi-Fi settings and joining the hotspot that's listed. If you're on a laptop, click the Wi-Fi icon and join the hotspot. [3] X Research source Pros: Like the iPhone hotspot, this method requires no additional installation and lets multiple people tether to the connection. If you're running the hotspot on a fully charged phone, the connection will last a few hours. Cons: Not all phone plans allow a hotspot. This method decreases your phone's battery and can raise your phone bill by using up your data. Making calls or tethering lots of phones at one time can create a weaker connection."

      "title": "Opt for a hotspot device to get internet with more flexibility.",
      "content": "Opt for a hotspot device to get internet with more flexibility. If you'd like to make phone calls or connect many people to your Wi-Fi at once, place a hotspot device in your car. These devices are also portable, so you can take the hotspot out of your car and use it anywhere you'd like to go. Charge the device by connecting it to a USB cord and plugging it into your car's USB port. These devices usually range between $10 to $50 per month. Purchase a portable hotspot device and data plan from your cellphone carrier. You might try AT&T's portable hotspots , Verizon's portable hotspots , or T-Mobile's portable hotspots . [4] X Research source Pros: The device offers you the ability to make calls and add lots of people to the connection without reducing the Wi-Fi connection. You can also leave it in your car or take it anywhere you'd like to go. Cons: You'll have to purchase another data plan for the device, and it will add to your monthly phone bill."

      "content": "An OBD-II offers in-car Wi-Fi access as well as additional services. These devices plug into the OBD-II port in your car and often offer helpful services like roadside assistance, emergency crash response, and vehicle diagnostics. They can accommodate many devices at once without a weakened connection and usually cost between $10 to $50 per month. Purchase an OBD-II device from Verizon through their online store. If you have AT&T or T-Mobile, contact your phone carrier to learn more about the OBD-II devices and monthly plans that they offer. [5] X Research source Pros: The device often offers helpful services like roadside assistance, emergency crash response, and vehicle diagnostics. It can accommodate many devices at once without a weakened connection. Cons: The device isn't portable (and you'll need to start your car to access the Wi-Fi). It will also increase the price of your monthly phone bill. If you have a car that was made before 1996, an OBD-II device won't be compatible with your car's OBD-I port. [6] X Research source In that case, you may be able to use a converter."

      "title": "Install a router for a permanent, dependable connection.",
      "content": "Install a router for a permanent, dependable connection. To get the best possible internet connection, consider setting up a wireless router in your car. A wireless router can cost anywhere between $30 and $600 to purchase depending on the Wi-Fi speed and how many devices it can support at a time. [7] X Research source For an economical option, consider the Mango Mini Travel Router or the Wireless Portable Nano Travel Router . If you'd like to support up to 20 devices and are open to a higher price, go for the NETGEAR Nighthawk Mobile Hotspot Router . [8] X Research source Pros: This option will provide the strongest possible internet connection. Though a few models have a device limit, some can support up to 20 devices without a weakened connection. Cons: Some wireless routers need a compatible modem (be sure to read the product description before purchasing a router). Wireless routers are also the most expensive option and require a more involved setup process (it may be best to hire a professional to help you install the router properly)."

      "title": "Park close to a public hotspot to get free Wi-Fi in your car.",
      "content": "Park close to a public hotspot to get free Wi-Fi in your car. If you're wondering how to get wifi in your car for free, this is the only option. Try parking near a public library, coffee shop, restaurant, or mall. Your connection may be weak depending on how close you are, but it's a great choice if you need to send a quick email. To get access on your phone or tablet, visit Settings, followed by Wi-Fi. Then, search the list for a free network to join. If you're using a laptop, click the Wi-Fi icon on your screen and join an available free network. [9] X Research source Pros: You can access Wi-Fi at no cost to you, which makes it the only truly free option on the list. Cons: Your connection may be weak or inconsistent. You can only use the Wi-Fi while you're parked in the parking lot, so it's not the best option if you're on the move or have somewhere to be."

      "title": "If your car is new, check if the model came with built-in Wi-Fi.",
      "content": "If your car is new, check if the model came with built-in Wi-Fi. Many car manufacturers offer cars and SUVS with built-in Wi-Fi hotspots. These require no extra installation and usually cost between $20 and $40 per month. If your car is a newer model, check with your manufacturer to see if your car has a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, and consider purchasing a monthly plan to enable it. Depending on your manufacturer, you may also be eligible for a free trial first. [10] X Research source Pros: You won't be required to install anything extra, and it can link to multiple devices at a time. Many dealers offer extra services that come along with it, like navigation systems, live traffic updates, and satellite radio. Cons: Dealers require you to buy a separate data plan, so it may not be cost-effective."
