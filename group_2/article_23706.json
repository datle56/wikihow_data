      "content": "Communicate with your partner about how you are feeling. Your libido will have an impact on your partner, so keep them informed to work on your sex life together. Open communication allows you to explore how to enjoy sex and one another’s desires. It’s important to define your sexual expectations together. [5] X Research source A lack of communication is a sure libido-killer. Think about it this way: How is your partner to know what you like or dislike if you can’t address it to them? By opening the lines of communication and being honest with yourself, you can tell your partner your desires and dislikes. Perhaps you enjoy a particular touch from your partner and when it doesn’t happen, you have a hard time finding your libido. Being able to pinpoint this and communicate you need to feel sexual will help keep your libido roaring. Keeping communication alive isn’t just about communicating on sex. It’s also important to be able to communicate about other life problems such as work and finances. If your partner is doing everything they should in the bedroom, perhaps your lack of libido is coming from elsewhere, such as resentment over a financial issue. Reader Poll: We asked 311 wikiHow readers how they like to communicate their needs to their partner, and 62% of them agreed that they prefer open and honest communication without judgment. [Take Poll] Remember, your partner cares about you and wants you to enjoy yourself, so don’t be afraid to tell them what you need."
