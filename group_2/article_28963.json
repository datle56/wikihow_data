      "content": "Wrap craft wire twice around the base of a permanent marker. Grab a pen or marker that’s about 1 cm (0.39 in) thick. Loop the wire around twice, which gives you a lot of room to make adjustments later on. Once you have 2 solid loops around the base of the marker, slide the wire off. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Trim away the excess wire with wire cutters to form a single ring.",
      "content": "Trim away the excess wire with wire cutters to form a single ring. Snip the wire away from the rest of the coil, which leaves you with 2 full circles of wire. Trim along both ends of the wire until you’re left with a single ring that can fit comfortably over your bottom lip. [2] X Research source It’s better to have more wire for your ring than not enough. Try to cut the wire in a straight, consistent line. If you cut at an angle, your wire will be too sharp."

      "content": "Pinch both ends of the ring together until they're almost touching. Push both ends of the wire towards one another, leaving a few millimeters of space in between. Don’t leave too much of a gap or your lip ring may slip and not look very believable. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Arrange the ring around the side of your bottom lip.",
      "content": "Arrange the ring around the side of your bottom lip. Take your lip ring out for a spin and see how it looks and feels. You may need to tighten or loosen your ring, depending on how it fits. Enjoy going out and about with your cool new accessory! [4] X Research source Place the ring along the center or side of your lip for a sleek look. You can also create “snakebites” and other cool looks by wearing more than 1 fake lip ring at once.

      "content": "Remove the pointy end of a hoop earring with some pliers. Pick up a pack of hoop earrings that are small enough to fit around your lip. Grab a pair of pliers and pry off the pointy earring rod that goes through an actual piercing. The earring should just be a plain hoop without anything extra attached. [6] X Research source You can find inexpensive hoop earrings online, or at any store that sells jewelry."

      "content": "Sand down the rough ends of the hoop with an emery board. Grab a clean emery board or nail file and start buffing the edges of the earring. Focus on making both ends of the ring as smooth as possible, so you don’t cut yourself when you actually wear the ring. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pinch both ends of the hoop close together. Use the pliers or your fingers to push both ends of the ring together, leaving only a few millimeters of space between both ends of the metal. Don’t leave too much space on your ring, or else it won’t stay put on your lip. [8] X Research source It’s okay if the ring isn’t perfectly adjusted at first—you can always tighten or loosen it later on."
