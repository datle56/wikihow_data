      "content": "Measure the dimensions of the painting. To hang Masonite without a frame, you’ll need to make a wooden border around the back of the board. The extra wood supports the screws, rings, and wire that hangs the painting. Start by measuring the length and height of the painting. Record those measurements so you don’t forget them.

      "content": "Cut 2 strips of wood to fit across the painting’s top and bottom edges. Get strips of wood that are 1 in (2.5 cm) x 2 in (5.1 cm) in thickness and width. Mark the strips to match the length of the board. Then use a saw and cut the strips to fit that length. [2] X Research source Always wear gloves and goggles when using a saw. Keep your fingers at least 6 in (15 cm) away from the blade while it’s spinning. You could use thicker wood if that’s the only thing available, but the board won’t hang as close to the wall if you use thick strips."

      "content": "Cut 2 more strips of wood to fit between the top and bottom pieces. Arrange the first 2 strips of wood along the top and bottom edges of the painting. Then measure the distance between the wood. Mark 2 more wood strips with this measurement and cut them with the saw. [3] X Research source For example, if there is 8 in (20 cm) between the wood, then cut the next 2 pieces so they're 8 in (20 cm) long."

      "content": "Glue the wood onto the back border. Squeeze a line of wood glue onto each strip of wood and use a brush to spread the glue around. Press each strip down onto the back of the board and hold it for 30 seconds. [4] X Research source Let the glue dry for at least 24 hours before trying to hang the painting. Otherwise the strips could come loose."

      "title": "Mark each side 1/3 of the distance down from the top of the painting.",
      "content": "Mark each side 1/3 of the distance down from the top of the painting. Take your ruler and measure the painting from top to bottom. Divide that measurement by 3 to break it into thirds. Make a mark on each side of the wood border 1/3 of the way down from the top. [5] X Research source For example, if the painting is 18 in (46 cm) in height, then make a mark 6 in (15 cm) from the top."

      "title": "Screw a D-ring into the mark on each side.",
      "content": "Screw a D-ring into the mark on each side. D-rings are small rings that screw onto frames and boards to hang them up. Line up the D-ring holes with the marks you made and point the ring towards the inside of the board. Then screw it into place with a power drill. Repeat this on the other side as well. [6] X Research source D-rings come in different sizes and usually range from 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) to 2 in (5.1 cm). Get something on the larger side to support the weight of the board best. D-ring kits should come with their own screws. If you don’t have the screws that came with the D-ring, don’t use screws longer than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) or you might punch through the board."

Loop it up and wrap the string around itself, then insert it back into the ring. Loop it back out of the ring and wrap the remaining wire around itself to tighten the knot. [7] X Research source Keep the wire tight the whole time you’re tying it. Give it a pull if it gets slack. You can find picture frame wire at hardware or craft stores, or order it online. It comes in a roll like string."

This allows you extra room to tie and loop the wire. Clip it off with wire cutters at this point. [8] X Research source You could also leave more than 4 in (10 cm) at the end of the wire to give yourself more room for error. You can wrap this excess wire around at the end or just clip it off."

Then grab the string in the middle of the board and pull it up towards the top. Adjust the tightness as needed and make sure the wire rests just below the top of the board. [9] X Research source This height is important because if the wire is too tight, the board won’t be stable. But if it’s too loose, the wire and nail will show above the top of the painting."

Repeat the same knot that you tied on the other side to secure the wire properly. [10] X Research source Test the wire before trying to hang the painting. Hold the frame by the wire to make sure it stays attached."

Take your measurements to a hardware store or framing store and see what’s available. Get a frame that matches your board dimensions and complements the painting design. Employees at the hardware store can offer you design suggestions for the best type of frame. [11] X Research source The length and height of the frame are most important. If the frame is too thick and there is too much space inside it, you can fill it out with foam. You have many options for painting frames, ranging from plain to ornate. Try to get a frame that complements the painting itself rather than focusing on matching the furniture and decor in the room it will hang in. [12] X Expert Source Peter Salerno Installation Expert Expert Interview. 10 June 2019. There are multiple sizes for Masonite board. They range from 5 in (13 cm) x 7 in (18 cm) all the way up to 24 in (61 cm) x 36 in (91 cm). A common painting size is 18 in (46 cm) x 24 in (61 cm). [13] X Research source"

[14] X Research source Most frames have latches along the edge that slide over and free the backing. In some cases, frames have screws that hold the backing down. Follow the procedure that your frame uses. You don’t need any glass or covering for a Masonite painting."

If the frame is too thick and the painting doesn’t take up all the space inside, it could rattle around and get damaged. Get some foam board from a hardware or craft store. Cut it to fit inside the frame and fill up any remaining space to protect the painting. [15] X Research source You could also use a similar cushioning material like Styrofoam to fill out the frame."

Press it into the back of the frame and either replace the screws or slide the latches back into place to secure it. [16] X Research source Pick the frame up slowly to make sure the backing is attached. Keep it close to the floor and give it a very light shake to make sure the backing and painting stay in place."

Run a stud finder along the wall and locate the closest stud where you want to hang the painting. Mark this location with a pencil. [17] X Research source If you don’t have a stud finder, you can tap along the wall with a hard object like the back of a screwdriver. If you hear a hollow sound, then there is no stud there. If you hear a quick thud, you’ve found the stud. In average homes, studs are placed 16 in (41 cm) apart, and sometimes 24 in (61 cm)."

Then hammer a nail into that point, leaving enough sticking out for the board to rest on. [18] X Research source The standard painting height is 57 in (140 cm), because that’s where the average person’s eye level is. You can follow this guideline if you’d like. [19] X Research source In general, make sure the painting is far enough away from couches and high-traffic areas so no one will bump into it."

      "title": "Hang the frame or board onto the nail.",
      "content": "Hang the frame or board onto the nail. Once the nail is in place, lift the board up to it. If the painting is in a frame, let the teeth on the back-clasp hook over the nail. If you’re using picture wire, let the wire rest on the nail and slide the board until the nail is right in the middle. Step back to make the board is level, then enjoy your new artwork. [20] X Research source Feel free to move the painting if you decide you want it in a different spot. Nails only leave small holes, so moving the painting around is no big deal."
