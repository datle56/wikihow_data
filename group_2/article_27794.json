[1] X Research source To make a Crafting Table, you’ll first need some Wood. Go and punch some trees to get some Wood (1 Wood creates 4 Wood Planks in your basic Crafting Grid, which is all you need). To punch a tree, simply press and hold the left mouse button (PC), press the Left Bumper button (Xbox) while facing the trunk, or simply tap the trunk with your finger (PE). If you already have a Crafting Table, you can go ahead to the section on making paper."

You’ll see, aside from several boxes where your items are stored in, a set of four empty boxes arranged into a box formation with an arrow pointing towards a single empty box. That is your initial Crafting Grid, where you can make various things. However, seeing as it only has 4 slots in the grid, you can’t make anything complicated with it, which is why you need a Crafting Table."

You’ll see that you got 4 Wood Planks for your single Wood. If you’ve got more wood, feel free to convert it all to planks, but for now, all you’ll be needing are 4 Wood Planks"
