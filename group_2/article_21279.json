    {
      "title": "Till the soil before planting the seeds.",
      "content": "Till the soil before planting the seeds. Use a rake, tiller, or pitchfork to dig 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) under the soil. Turn the soil over until you’ve loosened all the soil in your flower bed. [1] X Research source You may also want to incorporate compost into the soil to promote flower growth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sprinkle or bury the seeds, per the instructions.",
      "content": "Sprinkle or bury the seeds, per the instructions. The information on the seed packet will explain if the seeds have any special germination needs. Soft-shelled seeds should be pressed lightly into the soil, while hard-shelled seeds should be completely covered with soil. Read the instructions to see which method you should use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mark the planting area so you know where you planted the seeds.",
      "content": "Mark the planting area so you know where you planted the seeds. This is useful when planting a wide variety of seeds or plants. The visual reminder will also let you know whether the flowers are growing or if your seeds failed to germinate. [2] X Research source Not all seeds will become flowers. Labeling will also prevent you from mistaking your seedlings for weeds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mist the seedbed to keep the soil moist.",
      "content": "Mist the seedbed to keep the soil moist. Lightly mist your flowerbed with water so that the soil is moist. The soil should always be moist while the seeds are germinating. To see whether the soil is actually moist, press your finger down into your flowerbed. If the soil feels dry under the surface, you know you need to water your seeds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for your flower(s) to germinate.",
      "content": "Wait for your flower(s) to germinate. The flowers should germinate within 3 weeks to a month. If you don’t notice that they are starting to grow, you may have to lay down more seeds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Water your flowers.",
      "content": "Water your flowers. If it rains, you shouldn't have to water your flowers. However, it's important the soil under the flowers stays moist. If you have a period of time with no rain, water them so that the top 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) remains moist. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Prune dying flowers and leaves.",
      "content": "Prune dying flowers and leaves. Pruning the flowers after they have bloomed will encourage new growth. Use a set of hand pruners and clip away old or damaged flower petals or leaves. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use fertilizer if desired.",
      "content": "Use fertilizer if desired. An organic fertilizer will promote the health of your flowers and brighten their color. Look for a fertilizer designed for your specific type of flower, and sprinkle it on the surrounding soil. Read the instructions before to avoid over-fertilizing, which can lead to the flowers dying. [5] X Research source A balanced 5-10-10 fertilizer can be used on the widest variety of flowers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a container that has drainage holes in it.",
      "content": "Get a container that has drainage holes in it. If you want to grow multiple flowers, you can purchase an indoor planter that has spaces for more than one flower. It’s important that the container has drainage holes because overly saturated soil will inhibit the seed’s growth. [6] X Research source If you don’t want to buy a planter, you can punch holes in the bottom of an egg carton and use that instead. Put a rag or cloth under the container to prevent leaks."

    {
      "title": "Fill each section with a mixture of peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite.",
      "content": "Fill each section with a mixture of peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite. Combine the three different types of soils together in equal parts to create a well-drained soil high in organic material. Pour your flower container ¾ of the way up with this mixture. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bury or sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil, depending on their species.",
      "content": "Bury or sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil, depending on their species. Harder seeds should be covered with organic material like vermiculite or sphagnum moss, while softer seeds should lay on the top of the soil. Read the seed packet that came with your seeds to determine if you should bury them under the soil or leave them on top of it. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Water the seeds.",
      "content": "Water the seeds. Lightly sprinkle water on top of the soil, but don’t add too much or you could wash away smaller seeds. You can do this by sprinkling the water with your hand, or slowly pouring the water into the container from a small saucer. Either way, the soil should be moist but the seeds should still be intact. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the container with plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Cover the container with plastic wrap. Plastic wrap or a sealed lid will trap moisture and help the seeds germinate. Poke a couple of holes in the top of the plastic wrap so that the plant can breathe. [10] X Research source You can also wrap the planter in a plastic bag for a similar effect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move the planters to a warm area of the house.",
      "content": "Move the planters to a warm area of the house. Germinating seeds do best in temperatures of 65–75 °F (18–24 °C). Move the planter to a warm area that gets plenty of sunlight. Alternatively, you can place the planter on an artificial heat source, like the top of a refrigerator or near the oven. [11] X Research source Move the planter before you use the oven or heat could damage the seeds."

      "title": "Harden off the seedlings if transplanting them outside.",
      "content": "Harden off the seedlings if transplanting them outside. If you plan on transplanting your seedlings outdoors, harden them off by leaving them outside under a shaded area for 7-10 days. This will acclimate them to the change in temperature. Some flowers have an intolerance for the cold and should be kept indoors. [12] X Research source The seed package should give you a range of temperatures in that the flower will thrive. If a flower is cold-resistant, it should be labeled as hardy. Tender flowers are less resistant to cold and should always be in an area that’s over 40 °F (4 °C)."

    {
      "title": "Transplant the seedlings",
      "content": "Transplant the seedlings outside, if desired. Position a small spade 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) away from the seedling. Gently dig around the seedling, making sure not to sever any of its roots. Then, pull the seedling out of the planter, with the soil around its roots, and place it in well-drained soil in your garden. [13] X Research source Monitor the seedlings to make sure that they don't die after the transplant."
