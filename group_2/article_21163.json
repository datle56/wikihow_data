      "title": "Clean your Pomeranian's ears.",
      "content": "Clean your Pomeranian's ears. To begin the process of grooming your Pomeranian, swab out his/her ears with a cotton swab dipped in a non-alcohol-based cleaner. Simply lift up the dog's ear to expose the skin and gently clean the area with the cotton dipped in the cleaner. Never put any cotton tips or cotton buds down into the ear canal. If the dog moves suddenly it could force the cotton bud deep into the ear and cause damage. The non-alcohol-based cleaner will not sting the dog's ear like alcohol may."

      "title": "Trim the dog's nails.",
      "content": "Trim the dog's nails. Carefully trim the dogs nails by lifting their paws from behind and allowing the leg to bend at the joint. This is easier than trying to pull the paw toward you from the front. Try to identify the quick and leave a 4 to 5 millimeters length of nail to protect the quick. If you can't see the quick, nibble tiny amounts of nail away with the clippers just in case the dog has long quicks, which could bleed. Cut the nails using clippers specifically made for trimming dog nails. Keep styptic powder nearby to stop bleeding if you do accidentally cut the nails too short."

      "title": "File the dog's nails.",
      "content": "File the dog's nails. After you have trimmed your Pomeranian's nails, use a file made for dog nails to file until smooth. Be sure to praise your pet when you are finished in order to help them be more cooperative when you trim their nails in the future."

      "title": "Prepare to bathe your dog.",
      "content": "Prepare to bathe your dog. Bathe your Pomeranian prior to clipping so that your clipper blades do not get dull from oily fur. Some oils, however, are good for the dog's coat, so you should only bathe him or her about every three months unless otherwise necessary.

      "title": "Bathe your Pomeranian in a tub.",
      "content": "Bathe your Pomeranian in a tub. Place a non-slip mat or towel in your bathtub or in a large kitchen sink and fill with warm water. Lower the dog into the water, but be prepared for the animal to react—some dogs like baths, while others do not. For this reason, it is a good idea to have an assistant to help. Use a cup or pitcher to pour water gently over the dog, wetting the entire coat thoroughly, but be careful not to get water in the ear canal. You can use cotton swabs in the ears to help, but do not push them too far in. Avoid getting water in the dog's eyes."

      "title": "Lather the dog with shampoo.",
      "content": "Lather the dog with shampoo. Be sure to get the soap on his or her whole body, massaging it in gently as you do. Work from head to tail using a shampoo made specifically for use on dogs. Be sure scrub all areas of the animal evenly, including the tail, belly, legs, paws, etc. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the Pomeranian thoroughly.",
      "content": "Rinse the Pomeranian thoroughly. Rinsing your Pomeranian thoroughly is very important, as leftover shampoo that is not rinsed off properly can cause irritation. Use a sprayer, if possible, to rinse the dog, as it will more easily reach the skin and help remove all soap."

      "title": "Dry the Pomeranian.",
      "content": "Dry the Pomeranian. Drying your dog well will facilitate the rest of the grooming process. You can use a blow dryer or allow the dog to air dry. Be careful to thoroughly dry the dog's ears with a dry towel or paper towel. Parasites, bacteria, and yeast can build up there if not dried effectively."

      "title": "Brush your Pomeranian's teeth.",
      "content": "Brush your Pomeranian's teeth. Using a toothbrush and toothpaste made for dogs, brush your Pomeranian's teeth thoroughly. Some dogs may not like having teeth brushed and may resist, but keep trying for about five minutes per day, and over time your dog will be used to having his or her teeth cleaned, making teeth-brushing easier. Do not brush too hard, as dogs have sensitive gums. Brushing your dog's teeth can prevent potentially fatal bacterial infections.

      "title": "Brush your Pomeranian.",
      "content": "Brush your Pomeranian. Brush your dog's coat using a wire-pin or firm bristle bristle brush. Daily brushing is best, but a minimum of two brushings per week is recommended. Brush out from the skin instead of along the body. Regular brushings will help keep your dog's coat free of tangles."

      "title": "Avoid brushing dry hair.",
      "content": "Avoid brushing dry hair. It is widely recommended that you do not brush a Pomeranian's coat when it is dry. Doing so can cause static and strip the protective layer of the hair shaft, causing split ends. Mist the coat with a leave-in conditioner or a homemade leave-in conditioner that is 10% good quality bathing conditioner mixed with 90% filtered water. [4] X Research source You can also simply brush the dog's coat after bathing."

      "content": "Comb out any tangles and/or cut them out. After brushing, comb through your Pomeranian's coat with a fine-tooth steel comb to find any tangles. [5] X Research source You can try to use your spray-on conditioner to get the tangle out, but if that doesn't work, use scissors to cut it out. Use safety scissors available for dogs to ensure you don't injure your pet should he make a sudden movement while you are cutting."

      "title": "Exercise the dog prior to trimming.",
      "content": "Exercise the dog prior to trimming. Exercising your dog prior to trimming can minimize the dog's activity during grooming, which is safer. He or she may also be willing to sit still longer, giving you more time in which to complete grooming."

      "content": "Shape your Pomeranian's fur with scissors in targeted areas. You will want to trim and shape the dog's coat to give him the trademark fluffy look this breed is known for. Trim feet, shape the rear, and scissor the back, sides, underline, and chest to achieve this effect. You will also need to trim the tail, ears, and head. Give your Pomeranian a lion cut to accentuate their fluffy mane by leaving the hair around their neck long and thick. Try a puppy or teddy bear cut and trim their hair until it's 2 to 3 inches in length for an adorable look. Go for a show cut with minimal styling that lets your Pomeranian's hair grow out."
