This information can be obtained from your birth certificate or a valid passport. Holding dual-citizenship doesn’t disqualify you from being hired, though you may be subjected to additional screening. Because the NSA's underlying mission is the protection of the nation and its citizens, it’s possible that an applicant might be rejected on the basis of their cultural background. Agency officials reserve the right to pass over candidates that come from countries that aren't considered allies of the United States."

[2] X Research source As part of your background check, NSA investigators may get in touch with the people close to you, including your family, friends, neighbors, and current and former employers.

Keep your responses truthful and be prepared to explain any unusual readings that the machine happens to pick up. Do your best to stay calm. The subject’s heart rate and other involuntary factors are often used to interpret the results of the test, which means a nervous answer could be mistaken for a lie.

[10] X Research source The level of clearance you receive will be based on the responsibilities of your position. Technicians and public affairs officers may be issued standard badges, while elite crypto-analysts and counter-terrorism experts will be given top-secret clearance due to the highly sensitive nature of their work. Common grounds for denial of clearance include questionable foreign allegiances, drug abuse, debt, and emotional or psychological issues. [11] X Research source"
