      "content": "Drink 9-13 cups of fluids daily. Salt and water stay in and leave your body together, so keeping a balanced fluid level is important. In general, men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters). [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Water, juice, and tea count towards your fluids. Stay hydrated every day – it’ll help keep your electrolytes in balance during and after a workout. [4] X Research source Try to drink about 500ml (17 ounces) of fluid about two hours before you exercise. Recovery after intense exercise and sweating can be aided by drinking electrolyte water ."

      "content": "Stay hydrated when you’re sick. Vomiting , diarrhea , and high fevers can cause dehydration and lower your electrolytes. The best way to prevent this is to stay hydrated with water, broth, tea, and sports drinks. Including soup and beverages that contain salt will help keep your electrolytes and fluid levels balanced while you’re sick. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't rely on sports drinks alone to boost electrolytes. Sports drinks like Gatorade are marketed towards athletes, but they’re not necessarily the best choice to replenish the electrolytes you lose from sweating. Many sports drinks contain a lot of sugar in addition to the salt your body needs. Some sugar is good after exercise, but possibly not as much as these drinks contain. Try to replenish your electrolytes naturally with healthy food options. Coconut water is a good way to rehydrate more naturally than with sports drinks, and coconut water contains many needed electrolytes. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Go to the hospital for an IV if you get really dehydrated. Signs of dangerous dehydration in adults include extreme thirst, urinating little or not at all (or very dark urine), fatigue, dizziness, and confusion. [7] X Research source If you have these symptoms, you may need an IV of water and salt to replenish your fluids and electrolytes. Call your doctor right away or go to the hospital. Children may demonstrate dehydration differently. Look for crying without tears, a dry mouth or tongue, no wet diapers over 3 hours, sunken eyes, cheeks, or soft spot on top of their skull, irritability, or listlessness."

      "title": "Avoid over-hydrating.",
      "content": "Avoid over-hydrating. It is possible to drink too much water. When you drink more than your kidneys can filter, you retain water and can throw off your electrolyte balance. [8] X Research source It’s important to stay hydrated while exercising, but if you’re drinking a lot of water and start to feel nauseated, confused, disoriented, or get a headache, you may be over-hydrating. Don’t drink more than a liter of fluid every hour. When sweating a lot, drink half water and half sports drinks that contain electrolytes."

      "content": "Eat something salty after you sweat. You lose a lot of sodium from your body when you sweat heavily – that’s why sweat is salty! After your workout, sit down and have a salty snack like a bagel with peanut butter or a handful of peanuts. Nuts are a healthy high-sodium food, unlike other salty items from the snack-food aisle."

      "content": "Eat foods rich in potassium. After a heavy workout, it’s good to include some potassium-rich foods in your meal to increase your body’s potassium supply. You should also eat lots of foods high in potassium if you take a diuretic medication. Some good examples include avocadoes, bananas, baked potatoes, bran, carrots, lean beef, milk, oranges, peanut butter, legumes (beans and peas), salmon, spinach, tomatoes, and wheat germ.

Milk, yogurt, cheese, and cereals can be included in every meal. Other good foods for calcium include green leafy vegetables, oranges, canned salmon, shrimp, and peanuts. [10] X Research source Most athletes need at least three servings of dairy every day to get enough calcium, and teenagers should get at least four servings. A serving may be a 250ml glass of milk, a 200g tub of yogurt, or two slices (about 40g) of cheese."

Medical conditions should be managed with medications under your doctor’s supervision to prevent lowering your electrolytes to dangerous levels. Your OB/GYN can help you regulate your fluid levels while you’re pregnant.
