A pastor’s heart is Attentive and seeks to know his people’s cares. A pastor’s heart is Sacrificial and for his sheep will give its all. A pastor’s heart is Tender and listens to the Spirit’s call. A pastor’s heart is Obedient and heeds the Master’s commands. A pastor’s heart is Reflective and considers he is but a man.” —Deanna Malawy, “A Pastor’s Heart” “For all the times you walked with me And gently held my hand, The times you stopped to answer why, To help me learn and understand. Each time I fall or stumble, you Reach out to me and lift me up to stand. You are there in good times, Even though I forget to thank you. You are there in bad times, To pick me up and see me through. Thank you Pastor for being there To make each day brand new.” —Judy Crowe, “Thank You” “To you my pastor I give a gift It is a treat so sweet that you can not eat it It is a rock so solid that the ocean water can not wither it For this gift is like no other It can heal the sick from hurting again It can make the blind man see again It can make the handicap walk again For this gift is like no other It is stronger then the oceans currents It is more fragile then bubbles It is brighter then the stars It is deeper then the solar systems To you my pastor I give you this: “Thank you, and God bless you!” —Gus Brown, “A Gift”"
