The more tempting food you have lying the house, the more likely it is that you will give in and eat those unhealthy items. Creating a healthy environment at home can help support your weight loss. Toss out any sweets (like cookies, cupcakes or ice cream), chips, crackers and sugary beverages (like soda or fruit juice cocktail). You can also donate unopened items to a local food bank instead of throwing items in the garbage.

After a few weeks, you may be able to be less detailed with your meal plan — especially if you get into the groove of healthy, easy meals that you enjoy. If you notice yourself getting bored with your meals, revisit your meal plan and change it up. Don't fall off track out of boredom. Find new, healthy recipes to keep you on track."
