      "title": "Purchase a yard of stretchy, breathable fabric.",
      "content": "Purchase a yard of stretchy, breathable fabric. A stretchy knit or jersey fabric works well for making a baby car seat cover. This type of fabric will mold itself around the outside of the car seat for a snug fit while still allowing air to flow through the fabric. [1] X Research source Jersey fabric and other types of stretch knit fabric will not fray around the edges and do not require hemming. Make sure to pre-wash the fabric to ensure that it wonâ€™t shrink after you make the car seat cover."

      "content": "Fold the fabric in half width-wise. Take the 2 shortest ends of the fabric and line them up so that the fabric is folded in half. Smooth out the fabric to ensure that there are no bumps. [2] X Research source Fold the fabric the same way that it was folded when it came off of the bolt."

      "content": "Insert a pin 6.5 in (17 cm) from the edge of the fold. Line up your ruler with the folded edge so that it is flush with the top of the fabric. Then, insert a pin at the 6.5 in (17 cm) mark. [3] X Research source Push the pin through both layers of fabric. Use a clear ruler with angle lines across it to identify where to cut your fabric. You can find this type of ruler at a craft supply store."

      "content": "Measure 13 in (33 cm) down at a 45 degree angle from the first pin. Follow the 45 degree angle line from the first pin down to the bottom of the ruler. Then, insert a pin at the bottom of the 45 degree angle line. Make sure the pin goes through both layers of fabric. Then, measure from the pin with the measuring tape. Angle the measuring tape so that it is going across the second pin. Continue measuring at a 45 degree angle and place a third pin at the point 13 in (33 cm) from the top edge. [4] X Research source You may also use a ruler to locate this point if you have a ruler that is long enough."

      "content": "Use the ruler to identify and mark another 45 degree angle. Align the bottom corner of the clear ruler with the last pin you placed. Then, flip the ruler over going towards the bottom edge of the fabric to reverse the direction of the angle lines. Measure 13 in (33 cm) down from the last pin you placed. Use the measuring tape and clear ruler to position the measuring tape at a 45 degree angle from the pin going towards the bottom of the fabric. Place a pin at the 13 in (33 cm) mark. [5] X Research source Remember to measure in the opposite direction. This angle should mirror the first one."

Cut from pin to pin to get the required shape. The finished piece will be a hexagon, which is a 6-sided polygon. [6] X Research source Repeat to make a second hexagon in the same dimensions as the first."

Then, place the other piece on top of this piece with the right side facing down. Make sure that the edges of the pieces are even. Locate the top edges of the hexagons and place 3 evenly spaced pins along each of the angled edges. Insert the pins so that they go all the way through both pieces of fabric. [7] X Research source Smooth out the fabric pieces to ensure that there are no bumps before you pin them. Position the pins so that they are perpendicular to the edges. This will make it easier to remove them as you sew."

Set your sewing machine to the zigzag stitch setting and then place the end of the first angled edge under the presser foot. Lower the presser foot and apply gentle pressure to begin sewing along the edge. Sew from 1 end of the angled edge to the other. Then, stop the machine and cut the thread. [8] X Research source Repeat for the other angled edge. If possible, install a ballpoint or stretch needle before sewing your car seat cover. Otherwise, a universal needle will be fine. [9] X Research source Make sure to remove the pins as you sew. Do not sew over them or you may damage your sewing machine!"

Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the angle you have identified and discard the pieces that you cut off. [12] X Research source Repeat this on the opposite end so that the angles will match up when you fold the strip lengthwise. The pieces you cut off the ends of the strips will look like triangles."

Line up 1 seam of the strip with 1 seam of the cover. Position the strip along the outside of the bottom of the cover so that their edges are aligned. Place pins through the strip and cover, starting at the seam. [14] X Research source Insert the pins perpendicular to the edge of the fabric to make it easier to remove them as you sew. Keep in mind that some types of stretch fabric can be slippery! It might take a few tries to line up the edges just right."
