      "content": "See how he acts around other women. If he's just acting flirtatious towards you, it probably means there's something he likes about you in particular. However, if he's flirty with all of the ladies, then he may just be a flirtatious person who is naturally charming and charismatic. The next time you're hanging out with him and there are other women around, observe the way he talks to them and treats them. If this is exactly the same way that he talks to you, then he may not be truly flirting with you. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "See if being flirty is just part of his job. If he's on the job and is a waiter or bartender, for example, then part of his job may just have to do with being flirtatious with the ladies. Don't put too much stock into how he treats you on the job and see how he feels about you when he's off the clock. This will give you a better indication of how he really feels about you. On the other hand, if he's in a more professional setting with you, he may not flirt with you on the job even if he likes you because he doesn't want to get in trouble or doesn't feel comfortable flirting during work hours.

If he likes you, then he'll laugh at anything you say, even if you're not trying to be funny. If you find him laughing way too loud when you make jokes, or even nervously laughing when you're talking about what you ate for lunch, then this may be his way of flirting with you. He's probably just laughing because he's excited to be around you.

      "content": "See if he uses you as his lending library. If the guy is flirting with you, then he's really just looking for more opportunities to spend time with you. If he's always asking to borrow your books, your movies, or your notes for class, then chances are that he's really just looking for more excuses to talk to you and to have some of your stuff around so he can think about you even more. This may also have to do with him acting like he shares all of your interests so he can get you to like him!"

      "content": "See if he acts like a gentleman around you. Though some guys are just born gentlemen, if the guy likes you, then he'll want to open doors for you, pull out chairs for you, and offer you his coat if you're cold. If you're walking down the street, he may walk on the side of the street to \"protect\" you from traffic. Watch him around other girls; if he's only particularly gentlemanly to you, then he may definitely be flirting."

It's great if you and the guy have the exact same taste in music, books, movies, or food, but chances are that your tastes do have to diverge somewhat. If he gets a little bit too excited and nods eagerly when you mention your favorite new movie or band, then it may be because he's just trying to flirt and form a common bond with you so you like him more.

While this isn't the same as giving you a giant bouquet of flowers, this is the guy's way of flirting with you and of showing you that he pays attention to who you are and what you need. He's being thoughtful and doesn't want to scare you off with a grander gift if he's not sure that you really like him."

If he likes you, then he'll be worried about how he looks and how you perceive him, and one thing guys obsess over the most is their own hair. Check to see how many times he puts his hand in his hair or how many times he runs his hands around the back of his head the next time you're together. He may also just be playing with his hair because he's nervous around you, which is another sign that he likes you and is flirting."

It's biological. If he likes you, then his face will be on the alert, and you'll be able to see if he's flirting with you just by reading his face.
