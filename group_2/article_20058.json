      "content": "Spritz the silk with water. Before starting to iron the item, fill a spray bottle with water and spray the silk until it's completely damp. If you don’t have a spray bottle, soak the item in a tub of lukewarm water, then gently squeeze out the excess water. [1] X Research source If you want to wash your silk item before removing the wrinkles, place it into your washing machine on the delicate cycle, and follow any other care instructions on the item’s label. After the item is clean but still damp, proceed with ironing to remove the wrinkles."

      "content": "Switch on your iron and turn the silk item inside out. Turn on your iron and set it to the lowest setting. To protect the outside of the item from potential damage, turn it inside out before you iron it. [2] X Research source Make sure to unbutton the item if it’s a button-down shirt, so you’ll be able to lay it completely flat. Some irons have a delicate or silk setting. If your iron has one of these special settings, go ahead and use it!"

      "title": "Place the silk item on the ironing board and lay a towel over it.",
      "content": "Place the silk item on the ironing board and lay a towel over it. Smooth it out as best you can to ensure that the item is in one flat layer on the board. Put a thin towel, cloth, or T-shirt over the silk item to protect it from the iron. [3] X Research source If you are ironing a shirt that you cannot unbutton, slip the bottom of the shirt over the end of the ironing board, so that the fabric will be in one layer. When you’re done ironing that side, you’ll rotate the item to iron the other one."

      "title": "Iron the silk using the lowest setting.",
      "content": "Iron the silk using the lowest setting. Slowly run the iron over the towel that you’ve placed on top of the silk item. This will smooth out the wrinkles in the silk underneath. Go over the towel with the iron until you have covered the entire surface area, and be careful not to rest the iron on any single area for more than 5 seconds—this could damage the delicate silk."

After you have fully covered one side of the item, set down the iron, lift up the towel, and move a new section of the silk fabric onto the ironing board. Then, place the towel on top of the fabric again and continue to iron it. Repeat this until you have ironed the entire garment."

You can also hang it up on a clothesline outside if you want to speed up the drying process. The item is ready to wear when it is completely dry. If you still notice some wrinkles in the silk after the item is dry, you can repeat the process or try another option to remove them."

If you don't want to shower, turn on the water as hot as it will go, and let it run for about 3 to 5 minutes to fill up the bathroom with steam. [4] X Research source Don’t turn on the fan either! This will suck the steam out of the bathroom. If your item has a lot of stubborn wrinkles, you may need to run the hot water for a bit longer (up to 20 minutes). [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Transfer the silk item to a closet and let it dry overnight. After you finish your shower, take the item to your closet or any hook located outside of the bathroom. Hang it up until it is no longer damp. The moisture from the steam will help to add weight to the item, which will gently smooth out the wrinkles as it dries. [6] X Research source If the item still appears wrinkled after steaming it, you may need to use a handheld steamer or try a different option to remove the wrinkles. If you live in a hot, humid climate, you can even try hanging the silk item up outside for a few hours or all day. The moisture in the air and the heat should be enough to work out the wrinkles in your item."

If your silk item still has a few wrinkles or creases after it’s washed and dried, you can use a handheld steamer to get them out. Switch on the handheld steamer and move it back and forth over the wrinkles to remove them. [7] X Research source Then, let the item dry on a hanger again. If you don’t have a handheld steamer, you can achieve the same effect with the spout of a tea kettle. Fill your kettle about halfway, bring it to a boil, and remove it from the heat. Then, aim the spout at the wrinkled areas of your item to steam them. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Don’t worry about wetting areas that aren’t wrinkled. If the item is only slightly wrinkled, you don't need to use much water. For heavy or deep wrinkles, however, you’ll need to spray the areas until they are completely saturated and wet. If you don’t have a spray bottle, you can also dip the wrinkled areas into lukewarm water or hold them under running lukewarm water to moisten them."

This method may cost a bit more, but it’s a good option if you've been unable to successfully de-wrinkle the item on your own, or if you’re worried about damaging the delicate fabric. Be sure to check the care label on your silk clothing. Some items will be “Dry Clean Only,” which means that you'll have to go with this option. [11] X Research source"
