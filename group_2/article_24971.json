    {
      "title": "Stay calm.",
      "content": "Stay calm. Dogs that lunge at cars and people are reactive, meaning they are reacting to a fear or aggression it associates with the object or person. If you tense up or freak out, the dog is more likely to tense up or freak out as well. Stay calm and speak to your dog in a regular voice, don't shriek or yell. You can even act happy or excited, which shows your dog there is nothing to fear. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep your dog on a sturdy leash.",
      "content": "Keep your dog on a sturdy leash. If your dog has the tendency to lunge at people or cars, you shouldn't use a retractable leash or a long line that allows your pooch to stray far from you. Choose a leash made from a sturdy material like leather or nylon, and make sure the leash is no more than 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) long. You may want to consider either a head halter or a front-clip harness to easily redirect your dog's attention from things they wish to lunge at. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don't discipline your dog when they lunge.",
      "content": "Don't discipline your dog when they lunge. Disciplining your dog for being reactive reinforces their behavior because it teaches the dog to associate the object (car, bicyclist, etc.) with negative consequences (your yelling or actions). The dog then thinks the car or bicyclist causes bad things to happen, so the chances of the dog lunging again the next time are incredibly high. Simply ignore naughty behavior and don't reward your pet with treats. You could also say “no” in a stern voice, but avoid physically punishing your dog."

    {
      "title": "Avoid the things your dog lunges at.",
      "content": "Avoid the things your dog lunges at. When you see a jogger approaching or a car heading your way while you are out walking your pet, avoid these temptations for your dog to lunge. Simply cross the street or turn a corner so you don't come in contact with them. Until your dog has been trained to react calmly to these things, avoiding them is often the easiest solution. [3] X Research source You may choose to walk your dog at night or another time when there isn't as much commotion and traffic."

    {
      "title": "Block your dog's view.",
      "content": "Block your dog's view. One way to keep your dog from lunging is to avoid letting it see the person or thing it usually lunges at. When possible, block the pooch's view so that it cannot see the car or jogger. The dog will likely still be able to smell and sense the person or object, so it is learning to act calmly around it even when it isn't in the dog's direct line of sight. [4] X Research source It may be enough to simply put a fence around your property or duck behind a hedge when you see the mail carrier coming."

    {
      "title": "Redirect your dog's attention.",
      "content": "Redirect your dog's attention. Divert your dog's attention from an oncoming pedestrian or car to yourself. When your dog notices something or someone they would normally lunge at, call the dog's name. Then, offer the dog's favorite toy or a small treat when it looks at you. This teaches your dog to associate the person or car with attention or treats from you, which can prevent the dog from lunging. The goal is to make yourself, the treat, or the toy more interesting than whatever has gotten your dog's attention."

      "title": "Distract your dog with treats.",
      "content": "Distract your dog with treats. Lead your dog away from trouble by creating a treat path for them to follow. Prepare several fingernail-sized pieces of a treat that your dog enjoys -- the smellier the better! When you see something about to pass by that your dog would normally lunge at, drop a treat right in front of your dog. Once the dog finds it, drop another one, then another one once that one is eaten. [5] X Research source Continue doing this, dropping the treats along the path you wish for them to follow. Bringing along a high-value toy could also work to distract your dog."

      "content": "Teach your dog to turn to you at the sound of its name. To get your dog to turn and sit when distractions are present, start by calling your dog's name and rewarding it with a small treat when it turn to you. Do this throughout the day, in several different locations. To begin, you should practice this technique when no distractions, like joggers or cars, are present. [6] X Research source If you're having a hard time getting the dog to turn to you when you say its name, use a squeaker toy or clicker in conjunction with the dog's name. Keep working on this until your dog immediately turns to you whenever you say its name."

To get your dog to sit, hold a treat just above nose level, say “sit,” and move the treat toward the back of its head. Reward the dog with the treat when it sits. Again, this is something you should practice at multiple times in various locations. [7] X Research source"

Your dog will begin to associate their name with the command to sit, and before long, your dog should turn and sit when you call their name. [8] X Research source"

Have them start a fair distance away from you, like 30 feet (9.1 m). Cue your dog to turn and sit when it notices your friend or their car. If your dog has trouble obeying in their presence, ask them to move farther away until your dog learns to ignore them and focus on your commands. [9] X Research source Keep your dog on a leash while practicing this technique to ensure everyone remains safe. Provide small treats the entire time the dog remains sitting."

Provide your dog with a tiny treat when the doorbell is rung, and another one when the door is opened. Keep giving treats while the guests are in your dog's sight. [13] X Research source You can lead the dog to another room, or have the guests move to a different space, but stop giving the treats when the guests are no longer visible to your pet. You can also use treats and toys to train your dog to sit when people enter your home and stay in the same place until released by your command."

You can get a diffuser to distribute these pheromones throughout your home to help calm your pet. Alternatively, you may want to put your dog in a tight t-shirt, ThunderShirt, or Anxiety Wrap. These help your dog feel safe and secure when things that make it anxious are present. [14] X Research source"
