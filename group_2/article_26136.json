So you need to know what exactly you have available. You only want to add up the income that you know, without any doubt, that you will be receiving each month. While you get overtime, tips, or bonuses, don't account for them here -- if they all turned up empty, you need to know that you can live on your guaranteed income alone. Write this number down as \"monthly income.\""

Luckily, modern technology has made this easier than ever, as you can log-in online to see your bank and credit card activity. Most banks even break this up by type of spending as well, such as \"Food/Groceries,\" \"Gas,\" or \"Rent.\" Apps like Mint, Mvelopes, and HomeBudget, sync with your financial accounts and provide graphs of your spending each week. If you spend cash, keep the receipt and make a note of what you bought. Write this number down as \"monthly expenses\""

      "content": "Break your expenses down into fixed, essential, and non-essential to make sense of what you absolutely must buy. Some things, like rent, are due every month no matter what. There are some expenses, like food, that change a bit but cannot be cut much shorter. But there are other expenses that, with hindsight, you realize you didn't need to spend. Putting your expenses into these categories helps you analyze places to save money. If you can, average the expenses from a few months to get a more accurate number. Fixed Expenses: Do not change month to month, but are due every single month. Including rent, car/loan payments, etc. Essential Expenses: These can't be avoided -- food, transportation, utilities -- but can potentially be cut down through careful budgeting and saving. Non-Essential Expenses: This is your entertainment, fun, and everything else fund. More often than not this is where you will be able to save the most money. If possible, take a look at your last 12 months of bank statements and credit card statements so that you can take into account your fixed income expenses and variable expenses such as eating out or your credit card bill."

Once you know your expenses and your income, you know how much money you should have left for entertainment, debts, and savings. Figure out what you plan to spend on each category now to see how feasible each month will be. Entertainment: Everyone deserves to have fun, no matter how much money they make. Having low income doesn't mean you don't get to enjoy yourself. However, you need to be careful about spending your limited income. Having an \"entertainment budget\" will help. Debt and Loan Payments: Debt adds up quickly, and the faster you pay it off the more money you ultimately save. You should always have an eye on paying off debt with spare money. Whenever possible, pay more than the \"minimum payment\" to avoid growing interest. Savings Accounts: Even low-income workers need to save -- as it is an essential safeguard in case of an emergency like a layoff or injury. You want at least three months of expenses covered, if not six. [1] X Research source"

You cannot do this once and get a perfect budget, and you may find that you can spend or save more than you thought with practice. When you are living on a limited income, you need to keep an eye on your money regularly. At the end of the month, compare how you did in reality to how you planned in your budget. Find the places where there are differences and think about how you can fix it."

It also helps you match up ingredients between meals, meaning you can buy some things in bulk to save money. Start small by planning only your dinners, making use of leftovers and carrying over ingredients whenever possible. As you get used to it, expand to plan lunches and breakfasts, ensuring you have the perfect amount of food at the right price. Buy fruits and vegetables \"in-season\" to save money and get fresher food. Always buy generic or store-brand products. They are just as good and much cheaper. Generic medication must be exactly the same as name brand, too. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source"

At the end of the day, saving money and budgeting requires sacrifices -- you should find a way to cut out these needless expenses. Even cutting these habits in half can make a big difference and is a great starting point. Find alternative, cheaper habits whenever possible. Whenever you get an urge (smoking), fill in your new habit (taking a walk around the block) as a replacement."

Credit cards aren't free-- they come with interest rates that will gouge your paycheck if you let them run rampant. Managing your money wisely means using your credit cards wisely-- as extensions of your well-planned budget. Some things to remember: Know your rates and how they can change. If confused, call your bank and make sure you understand your terms and interest. Pay more than the monthly minimum whenever possible, as this decreases later interest payments. Stay within 30-40% of your credit card limit. You never want to be reaching your limit, as the interest will become exponentially worse. Staying at our below 20% is a good benchmark for cautious spenders. [8] X Research source"
