Clicking on an element will bring up a popup sidebar that allows you to edit it. These sidebars have multiple tabs. Each element has different tabs, so click through those tabs to see what you can do with the site editor. Most elements have a tab to edit the content of the element (text, image, etc.), a tab to edit the parameters or properties of the content (font size, image size, etc.), and a tab to edit the animation of the content (how it appears when the page loads)."

[2] X Research source Links can be added by clicking on the button or icon, then clicking on the name of the particular button or icon you want to edit in the sidebar. Buttons and icons can be changed to fit your needs. If the template gives you a space to link your Instagram and Facebook, but you only have a Twitter/X and DeviantArt, you can change the icon on the icon or button to match what link you're inserting.

You can rearrange the order of a list of buttons or icons by dragging the name of the button or icon in the popup sidebar. Delete items you don't need by clicking on them and clicking the delete button at the bottom of the sidebar. If you want to delete just one button or icon, click the trashcan button next to that particular button or icon. Add items by clicking the plus button on the toolbar at the top of the page. You can add a variety of elements to a page. Your template probably already has text, images, buttons, and icons, but you can also add lists, videos, audio, galleries, and more. Pro users can add slideshows, forms, widgets, and embeds. More advanced users can use containers and controls to further design their websites. You can also add new elements by duplicating existing ones by clicking on the existing element and clicking the duplicate button at the bottom of the sidebar."

Pro Lite is $9 per year and allows you three sites with no element limit and no Carrd branding. You can't use a custom domain, forms, or commerce widgets, but you can add multiple editors to your site, transfer your site, and use custom code. Pro Standard is $19 per year and allows you 10 sites. Along with the perks of the Pro Lite tier, you can add a custom domain as well as use forms and commerce widgets. Pro Plus is $49 per year and allows you 25 sites. Along with the perks of the previous two tiers, Pro Plus allows you to customize your site's meta tags as well as download the HTML so you can host your site somewhere else."

A paid plan is beneficial if you know you'll need to place more than 50 elements on your site, or you want to host multiple sites. Otherwise, if you're just testing out Carrd or only need a simple site, the free plan should be more than enough for your needs."
