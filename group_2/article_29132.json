      "content": "Butter a single side on 2 slices of bread. Pick your favorite type of bread for your sandwich and take 2 slices from the loaf. Use room temperature butter so it’s easier to spread and doesn’t tear your bread. Coat a side of each piece of bread with the butter so it crisps up and doesn’t burn when you put it in the pan.

      "title": "Preheat a non-stick pan on your stove over medium heat.",
      "content": "Preheat a non-stick pan on your stove over medium heat. Set your non-stick pan on your stove and turn it on to high heat. Let the pan heat up completely before you put your sandwich on it so you get an even cook. Flick a few drops of water on the pan, and if they sizzle and evaporate right away, your pan’s hot enough for the sandwich. [2] X Research source Don’t keep the heat too high on your stove or else it will burn the bread without melting the cheese."

    {
      "title": "Assemble your sandwich in the pan.",
      "content": "Assemble your sandwich in the pan. Once the pan is hot, place the first slice of bread into the pan buttered-side down. Top the piece of bread with 1-2 slices of your favorite cheese, then put the second slice of bread on top with the buttered side face-up. [3] X Research source American cheese melts the easiest, but you can use any type of cheese you want for your sandwich. Try using or mixing different cheeses to change the flavor of your sandwich. Try using Cheddar, Provolone, Swiss, Gouda, or pepper jack for slightly different flavors. You may also use shredded cheese if you want it to melt faster."

      "title": "Cook the bottom slice of bread for 3-4 minutes or until it’s golden brown.",
      "content": "Cook the bottom slice of bread for 3-4 minutes or until it’s golden brown. Let the bottom of the sandwich cook for 3-4 minutes so the bread gets crispy. Lift the sandwich with a spatula occasionally so you can check the color of the bottom slice. Be careful not to let the bread burn while it’s cooking. [4] X Research source Don’t leave your sandwich unattended as it can burn or be a fire risk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the sandwich and cook the other side for 2-3 minutes.",
      "content": "Flip the sandwich and cook the other side for 2-3 minutes. Slide a spatula underneath the bottom slice of bread and quickly flip the sandwich over so the buttered side of the second slice is face down. Press down on the sandwich with your spatula to ensure the bread contacts the pan evenly. Let the sandwich cook for another few minutes or until the bread has turned golden brown and the cheese has melted. [5] X Research source Be careful when you flip the sandwich since it can easily disassemble. Use your other hand to hold the bread in place as you flip it. Flip the sandwich over again if the first slice is undercooked so it can brown properly and crisp up."

      "title": "Cut the sandwich before serving it.",
      "content": "Cut the sandwich before serving it. Transfer the sandwich to a cutting board once it’s finished cooking. Use a bread knife or paring knife to cut the sandwich diagonally to help it cool off as you eat it. Serve the sandwich while it’s still hot. [6] X Research source The cheese can be very hot, so take a small bite at first so you don’t burn yourself. If you have leftovers, wrap them in foil or store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week."

Turn the oven on to 450 °F (232 °C) and let it heat completely while you prepare your sandwiches. Once the oven is up to temperature, you can cook your sandwiches. [7] X Research source You can also use a toaster oven if you don’t want to heat up your regular oven."

      "content": "Butter your slices of bread on 1 side. Choose your favorite type of bread to use for your sandwich. Use 2 slices of the bread and spread room temperature butter on 1 side of each slice. Spread the butter to the edges of the slice to help get even browning and prevent them from burning. [8] X Research source Soften the butter if you don’t have any at room temperature so you don’t rip pieces off of your bread. Alternatively, you can spread mayonnaise on your bread instead of butter."

      "content": "Lay your slices of bread on a baking sheet butter-side down. Use a rimmed baking sheet large enough so you can place the slices of bread about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Lay the slices of bread so the buttered sides are face down on the tray so they can get crispy. [9] X Research source You can also use a flat baking sheet if you don’t have one with a rim, but the butter could drip into your oven as it melts."

Place 1-2 slices of cheese on top of each piece of bread so they don’t overhang the edges, or else they could drip off of your sandwich. [10] X Research source Try other cheeses, such as mozzarella, Swiss, or Gouda for different flavors. You can put cheese on only 1 slice of bread if you don’t want your sandwich to be as greasy."

Check on the bread and cheese occasionally to make sure they aren’t burning. After 4-5 minutes, the cheese will start melting and bubbling on your sandwich. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull the tray out to assemble the sandwich. Take the tray out of your oven so you can put the sandwich together. Use a spatula to pick up one of the bread slices and flip it upside down on top of the other slice. Make sure the edges of the bread line up with one another so none of your cheese drips off. [12] X Research source Don’t turn your oven off yet since you still need to keep cooking the sandwich. The baking tray will be extremely hot so wear an oven mitt while you’re handling it."

[13] X Research source The bread and cheese will be hot when you take it out of the oven, so be careful so you don’t accidentally burn yourself. You don’t need to put the sandwich back in your oven if the bread’s already golden brown and crispy when you assemble it. Store leftovers in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 1 week."

      "content": "Turn your toaster on its side so you can slide bread in horizontally. The cheese won’t melt on your bread if the toaster’s still upright while you cook it. Carefully tilt your toaster on its side so the slots face horizontally rather than vertically. That way, the cheese will melt on top of the bread without falling off. [14] X Research source If you can’t turn your toaster sideways, you can purchase toaster bags online to make your sandwich while the toaster’s still upright."

Carefully slide the bread and cheese sideways into the slots of the toaster. Make sure the cheese doesn’t fall off the bread when you insert it. [15] X Research source Don’t use bread that’s too thick since it may not fit in your toaster. American cheese will melt the best in your toaster, but you can use any type of cheese."

Use a plastic spatula or fork to pull the bread out from the slots. Put the pieces of bread together to make your sandwich and serve it while it’s hot. [17] X Research source Never insert a metal object inside your toaster, even when it’s unplugged. If your bread isn’t crispy or the cheese hasn’t melted, toast it for another 1-2 minutes.

Cook your sandwich normally so the cheese melts around the tomato. Season your sandwich with fresh basil to make the sandwich taste fresh.

Lay the apples on top of the cheese in the middle of your sandwich and cook the sandwich as you normally would. The cheese and apples will cook together to make sweet and salty flavors.
