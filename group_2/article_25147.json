      "title": "Killer Network Service prioritizes network usage for latency-sensitive apps.",
      "content": "Killer Network Service prioritizes network usage for latency-sensitive apps. This includes gamers, so your game doesn't stutter as your computer automatically downloads an OS update. Other latency-sensitive apps and activities include streaming apps, video or audio communication software, or tasks that require real-time response, such as online stock trading. Essentially, KNS manages network bandwidth based on task priority. In this case, the game has a higher priority than the background download. KNS is beneficial to gamers, streamers, and multitaskers since they are more likely to be negatively impacted by lag spikes or interrupted network data."

Extensive network traffic monitoring : If you have multiple apps open that need internet access, KNS will work too hard to manage your network usage. Outdated software : Using an old version of KNS will hurt your computer more than help it. Additionally, older versions may not be optimized for newer network protocols. Software conflicts : Some security apps, like Norton or McAfee, might block KNS. High network demand : High-bandwidth activities, like streaming or gaming, make KNS work harder to maintain the network quality."
