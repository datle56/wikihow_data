This recipe makes 11 ounces of sunscreen with an estimated SPF of 10 to 15: 1 cup Olive oil or other natural oil (grocery store) 1 oz (28 g) Pure beeswax (health food store or online) 1 to 2 tbsp USP grade zinc oxide or titanium dioxide powder (health food store, pharmacy or online) Essential oil (optional)"

These tools should only be used for making sunscreen, as residual oxide powder could leech into your food and make you ill. Saucepan Heat-resistant glass jar (optional, if using double-boiler method) Spoon for stirring Gloves and face mask Stove Storage container with lid (glass jar, ceramic pot, or plastic bottle will do)"

      "title": "Pour the base oil into a saucepan and heat it.",
      "content": "Pour the base oil into a saucepan and heat it. If you’re using a gas stove, use a low flame. If you’re using an electric stove, set your element to a medium heat. To ensure the integrity of the ingredients, you might try using a double-boiler method to melt them instead of placing them directly in the saucepan. This will also save you from having to only use your saucepan for making sunscreen. To use the double-boiler method, heat an inch or two of water in a saucepan until it’s simmering, then mix the ingredients (NOT including the oxide powder) in a heat-resistant glass jar and place the jar upright into the water, allowing it to sit there until all of the ingredients are melted together."

    {
      "title": "Add 1 ounce of beeswax to the saucepan.",
      "content": "Add 1 ounce of beeswax to the saucepan. If it’s not already in pearls or broken into pieces, you’ll need to grate or chop the beeswax into small pieces before adding it to the oil. This will help it melt faster. The beeswax makes the resulting product viscous, like a skin cream. It’s what holds the oxide in suspension so that it doesn’t all sink down to the bottom of the container. For a thicker, heavier sunscreen, add more beeswax. For one that is lighter and smooths on more easily, add a little less beeswax. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Stir constantly until the beeswax is completely melted in the hot oil.",
      "content": "Stir constantly until the beeswax is completely melted in the hot oil. You want the ingredients to be completely melted together before you add the oxide powder."

      "content": "Add your essential oil (optional). If you want to add a fragrance to your sunscreen via an essential oil, now is the time to do it. Lavender oil is a popular choice, and has a natural SPF of up to 6.

      "title": "Put on your protective gear.",
      "content": "Put on your protective gear. Wear gloves and a face mask to protect you from coming in direct contact with the oxide powder. In particular, you want to protect yourself from inhaling it, which can be dangerous to your health. As an extra precaution you can also wear safety goggles, which will protect your eyes in case anything splashes up when you add the powder to the hot oil solution. As you’ll be dealing with hot oil, make sure that the gloves you wear are heat-resistant and won’t melt if any oil splashes up on to them. Heat-resistant rubber gloves will work well. Just make sure they fit you well so that you can still use your hands without feeling clumsy."

      "content": "Add 1 to 2 tbsp of oxide powder to the melted mixture. Add just a little bit at a time while constantly stirring to ensure that the mixture is well blended. The oxide powder must be evenly distributed throughout the mixture to make an effective sunscreen. You can use either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, although zinc oxide seems to be more common amongst DIY sunscreen makers. Make sure the powder is USP grade, which means that it is suitable for food, drug, or medicinal use."

      "content": "Remove from heat and pour into storage container. Once everything is mixed together, remove the mixture from the stove and pour it into its storage container. Small mason jars with lids are highly recommended. Depending on the thickness of your mixture, you might be able to get away with a squeeze bottle. A wide-mouthed jar will make it easier for you to stir the solution while it cools though, and less of the solution will be likely to go to waste. If you’re pouring the mixture into a container with a narrow neck, use a pastry bag to squeeze the sunscreen through. It will likely be too thick for a funnel. Just make sure that the sunscreen isn’t still very hot while you do this lest you burn yourself."

      "content": "Allow to cool to room temperature before use. Once the sunscreen is room temperature, you can put it on your skin. Note that the sunscreen should be opaque. If it looks translucent, the oxide has likely sunk to the bottom of the container. The oxide can settle when the sunscreen is cooling. It can also sink to the bottom of the container if it is out in the heat for too long. It’s important to stir it or shake it up before use in these situations, so that you get the full protective benefits of the oxide."

[4] X Research source Make sure you keep it in a cool, dry place. If the sunscreen gets too hot or too cold, the ingredients might shift. If the oxide powder isn’t evenly distributed throughout the sunscreen, it will not be effective. If the sunscreen melts or hardens, you will need to stir the sunscreen to evenly distribute the oxide powder once it’s back at room temperature and a regular thickness."

      "content": "Always add an oxide to your sunscreen. The most important ingredient in homemade sunscreen is oxide, which comes in the form of either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Both of these offer protection against UVA and UVB rays, and are an absolute must. The more oxide you use in your sunscreen mixture, the more protection you’ll get. Sunscreens commonly come in concentrations of between 5% and 25% oxide. [11] X Research source Both types of oxide are effective, but zinc oxide is believed to offer broader, more effective sun protection. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Know the risks involved in making your own sunscreen. The efficacy of your homemade sunscreen is not only based on your ingredients, but on the way in which you’ve made the sunscreen. This is the primary concern expressed by doctors when discussing DIY sunscreen. Doctors worry that even if the ingredients are effective, the way in which they are mixed might undermine them. For instance, if your oxide powder isn’t properly blended with the rest of the ingredients, it might only protect your skin in patches, or worse, not at all. [13] X Research source Doctors also warn that since DIY sunscreen makers don’t usually have labs or testing environments for their sunscreen, there is no scientific way to properly measure the level of UV protection their mixtures provide.

It does not protect against UVA rays, which are what age you. Both types of rays can cause skin cancer. [15] X Research source To be properly protected, you must have a sunscreen that protects against booth UVA and UVB rays. This is why it’s so important to have a good amount of oxide powder in your sunscreen. Zinc oxide in particular is good at blocking UVA and UVB rays. [16] X Research source"

Note that consuming these things is not enough to protect you from the sun. You must wear sunscreen. Cocoa, green and black tea, micro-algae (chlorella and spirulina), and carotenoids and antioxidants found in fruits and veggies are all great for boosting your skin’s natural ability to fight the sun’s harmful rays."
