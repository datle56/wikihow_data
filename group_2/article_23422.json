      "title": "Expect an air of reserve with strangers.",
      "content": "Expect an air of reserve with strangers. Although Egyptian maus are fiercely loyal to their family members, they tend to be shy with strangers. This is not a breed that will rub up on just any person walking by. Instead, their loyalty and friendliness needs to be earned over time. [2] X Research source In some cats, this reserve can be seen when the cat hears an unexpected noise or sees something unexpected. They are likely to run away and hide from the unknown. This behavior is best prevented by giving Egyptian mau kittens lots of socialization."

      "title": "Identify athleticism and inquisitiveness.",
      "content": "Identify athleticism and inquisitiveness. An Egyptian mau loves to climb and leap and will do this in order to explore its surroundings. They will likely climb anywhere in the house that they can, including onto your shoulders or on top of your refrigerator. Don't be surprised if they jump out at you from an unexpected high spot. Their intelligence combined with their athleticism means that they may quickly learn how to get to what they want, whether it be food, toys, or treats. The Egyptian mau is particularly agile and athletic. This is partly due to their physical build, which includes loose skin between the legs that allows for agility when jumping and twisting."

      "content": "Discuss your cat's breed with its veterinarian. If you have a question about your cat's breed, the easiest person to ask that has some expertise is your veterinarian.

If your veterinarian doesn't know your cat's breed off hand, they may be willing to do a little research and then get back to you with what they find out."

      "title": "Have a cat ancestry DNA test done.",
      "content": "Have a cat ancestry DNA test done. The best verification you can get of your cat's breed is through a DNA test, specifically one that tests the cat's ancestry. In order to get DNA testing done you will need to contact a company or organization that does cat ancestry testing and have them send you a sampling kit. Once you have collected a sample of your cat's saliva using the kit and the directions included, you will send it back to the company to be analyzed. Once the sample has been analyzed, the company will send you the results. There are a variety of companies and organizations that scientifically analyze cat saliva in order to give you information about its breed. Some are private labs that do a variety of DNA testing and some are labs connected to organizations, such as veterinary schools or animal appreciation organizations. This is done for a fee, so you may want to look for reviews of various companies and compare prices before committing to a specific company."
