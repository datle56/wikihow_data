      "content": "Stick or MIG welding are beginner-friendly options. Gas Metal Arc welding (MIG) and Stick welding, also called Arc welding, are the two most common and affordable welding methods. MIG consists of two types of welding; the first type uses bare wire, while the second uses flux core to join thin pieces of metal together. Meanwhile, Stick welding is considered the “old fashioned” way of doing things, as it uses a stick electrode welding rod to join pieces together. [3] X Research source If you’ve already taken a course or class, stick with the welding technique and machine you’ve already used."

If no community centers or schools offer welding classes, or you can’t afford them, local welders may be willing to show you the ropes. Search for welding or metal fabrication companies near you, and then call them and tell them that you’re interested in touring their workshop. Arrange a time and date to visit them, then express your interest while taking the tour. Welding and metal fabrication companies often offer free tours. If you want to learn how to weld, ask metal fabricators if you can apprentice or work as a fellow under them. Seeing welding in person will give you a better idea of whether it’s the hobby for you."

Attach an ArCO2 gas tank by securing it to the side of the machine with a metal chain. Remove the tank’s protective cover, and attach the gas regulator flow meter by hand, tightening with a wrench. Then, screw the gas hose to the regulator and the MIG machine. Open the gas valve half-way. Set the flow rate to 20 Cubic Feet per Hour (CFH) while pulling the MIG’s trigger. [15] X Research source You do not need gas to MIG weld. However, you’ll need to use a specific flux-cored filler wire instead of a gas tank. [16] X Research source A shielding gas tank protects the weld pool (the dime-sized portion of a weld where the base has reached its melting point) from the atmosphere and similar outside contaminants.

      "title": "Select the appropriate amperage output and wire size.",
      "content": "Select the appropriate amperage output and wire size. When setting up your MIG welder, the material thickness you’re working with determines the amperage you need. Generally, each .0001 inch of material thickness requires 1 amp of output. From there, you can select the appropriate wire size. Typically, when working between 30 and 130 amps, you’ll use a .023-inch wire. Always consult your machine’s owner’s manual as it contains important information about operation and safety. When in doubt, you can consult online wire size charts to determine the amperage you need to work with."

      "title": "Adjust the wire speed and voltage to make a consistent weld.",
      "content": "Adjust the wire speed and voltage to make a consistent weld. Your machine determines your speed, the type of wire, and the metal thickness you’re welding. Generally, your machine will come with a chart, manual, or specification guide that you can refer to. However, it may be a game of trial and error. As you weld, listen for a consistent sizzle similar to the sound of bacon on a frying pan. That’s how you’ll know you’re welding a proper bead. If you weld cracks and spurts, adjust your settings. [18] X Research source Typically, slower wire speeds work better on thinner pieces of metal. You can also consult online charts to determine the wire speed, which may require some math. For example, if you’re working with 130 amps, multiply 3.5 x 130 = 455 ipm (inches per minute) for the wire speed."

If you’re working with a 90-degree joint angle, position your rod at a 45-degree work angle, coming in with a flat or overhead fillet joint. [29] X Research source For a 180-degree joint angle, use a 90-degree work angle to create a butt joint (where two pieces are joined together side by side). For a 90-degree lap joint angle (where two metals are overlapping), use a 60 to 70-degree work angle, using the road at a flat or horizontal angle."
