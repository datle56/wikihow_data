      "content": "Draw an 8 in (20 cm) equilateral triangle on a piece of paper. This will be the template you use to create each triangle for the bunting. Use a thicker piece of paper for the template, like cardstock or even cardboard, if you want the template to be sturdier. [1] X Research source If you have a different size triangle in mind, make the template to fit that vision. You can make the template triangles as large or as small as you like. Maybe you want narrow triangles so the long points move freely in the wind, or maybe you want to alternate between small and large equilateral triangles to create depth."

Since this triangle will be your template, any wobbles or divots within the straight lines of the pattern will show up in each triangle you trace. If you have a paper cutter, use that to cut clean, straight lines. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Select a flag design that will complement the occasion or setting. Liven up your bunting by choosing a handful of colors or a distinct pattern. Break up flags with busy patterns, like stripes or floral designs, with complementary solid-colored flags. Make the bunting the focal point of the setting by having each flag be a different color covered in glitter. [3] X Research source If this is a permanent bunting for your room, play off some of the colors or textures that already exist within the room. Maybe purple and silver are prominent colors in your room. Incorporate different shades of those colors into the bunting, and add some silver glitter to make it pop. Bunting for a baby shower could be calming tones like a mix pastel blue, green, pink, and yellow. Alternate the color of the flags, and maybe even make some of the flags with white polka dots to add contrasting texture."

      "content": "Select a material that fits the setting and your timeframe. Think about whether or not the setting for the bunting is inside or outside, and determine how much time you want or have to spend creating it. Fabric bunting can be used both inside and outside but may take a while to put together if you have never sewn before. Paper bunting is easy to assemble, but won't withstand rainy weather if hung outside. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pin each corner of the template to a straight edge on your fabric.",
      "content": "Pin each corner of the template to a straight edge on your fabric. Working across your fabric from one side to the other will reduce fabric waste, and will allow you to make more triangles. This is less important if you are using small pieces of fabric, like tea towels. Make sure that the edges of the fabric are straight when using them as a guide for the template; otherwise, you will end up with wobbly looking flags. For uneven edges, pin the template away from the edge or trim the edges to straighten them. If you have a large piece of fabric, fold the fabric in half before pinning the template to it. This will allow you to save time by cutting 2 flags at once. The amount of the fabric you use can vary greatly depending on how large your template is and how many flags you want to make. Ideally, make your template first and decide approximately how many triangles you want to make before purchasing the fabric. Those measurements will help you determine how much fabric you will need. Choose a simple fabric like a cotton-polyester blend for making the bunting. Silks or other fancy blends may be difficult to sew. Using fabrics that have a print or color on both sides instead of just one side will also save you a lot of time while sewing."

      "content": "Cut around the template using pinking shears. The saw-toothed edges of the pinking shears will keep the cut edges of your fabric from fraying. Purchase these online or at a local craft or fabric store. [5] X Research source Instead of pinking shears, use fabric scissors that have a straight edge or a rotary cutter. Keep the fabric taut, and cut it slowly to keep the edges from tearing or fraying. If you decide to use a rotary cutter, place a board underneath the fabric so you do not damage the surface you are working on."

      "content": "Repeat the process until you have a desired number of flags. The flags can be close together or spread out, so the number of flags you need to make greatly depends on the look you want to achieve. Start by making 6 to 10 flags. After you arrange them, you can always cut out more. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut double the amount of triangles for fabrics with single-sided designs.",
      "content": "Cut double the amount of triangles for fabrics with single-sided designs. Not all fabrics have a given pattern or color on both sides. To keep the bunting uniform, you will need to stitch together 2 triangles to create a single flag. This way, the pattern or color will visible on both sides. So if you wanted 6 flags, you will need to cut 12 triangles, and stitch them together in pairs. [7] X Research source To do this, layer and pin 2 triangles together so that the pattern is facing inwards. Use a straight stitch to sew 2 of the triangle sides together. If you are not using an equilateral triangle, this would be the 2 longer sides. Accomplish this by using a sewing machine or a needle and a thread. Leave approximately a 1 ⁄ 5 in (0.51 cm) seam around the flag. Remove the pins and then push the point of the flag through the unstitched side so that the pattern is right-side out. Press the flag down until it is smooth. Don't worry about stitching the final side to the triangle, as it will be covered with bias binding tape. Repeat this process until all of your flags are completed."

Place the first flag at least 16 in (41 cm) in from the end of the tape—this will be one of the ends used to hang the bunting. Then have fun playing with the spacing of the flags. The flags can be close together so the points are touching, or drastically spread apart. Once you place the last flag, leave another 16 in (41 cm) of excess tape on the end before you cut it. [8] X Research source If you can't decide on a measurement, aim to have at least 5 in (13 cm) of space between each flag. [9] X Research source It is easier to arrange and adjust the spacing of the flags on the tape before you cut it. This way, you have the option to increase or decrease the spacing without worrying about the length of the tape. [10] X Research source If you had to stitch your flags, place the unsewn end of the flag along the tape. This will later hide and seal the open end of the flag. [11] X Research source"

Press in the crease with your fingernail or the edge of a ruler. When folded, the piece of paper should still be able to support the size of the template you made. To do this, choose a piece of paper that's at least double the size of your flag template. [14] X Research source To save yourself some time, make the size of your flag fit an existing paper size. For example, a standard piece of scrapbook paper that is 12 by 12 in (30 by 30 cm) will make 2 equilateral triangles that are 6 in (15 cm) around. Making your template for a 6 in (15 cm) triangle will eliminate a lot of tedious measuring later on. If you want to reuse your paper bunting for different events, use a thick paper like cardstock or scrapbook paper. Thicker paper won't crease or tear as easily as printer or construction paper."
