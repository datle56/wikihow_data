      "content": "Make sure your first sentence is the most powerful. According to social media expert Kasey Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. After a few lines of text, Instagram hides the rest of your caption, so include the most important and eye-catching details in the beginning. Most users are less likely to read a lengthy caption, so when in doubt, keep it short and sweet. Don’t be afraid to sprinkle in some emojis to add more personality and character! Social media and digital marketing consultant Candace Gasper also recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption."
