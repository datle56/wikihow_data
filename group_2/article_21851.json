      "content": "Make it personal. The best and most sincere birthday messages are personalized to the birthday boy or girl. Whether you’re writing something sweet or silly, make sure it’s something they’ll love. For instance, focus the message on their talents, attributes, or interests. Let the message speak to them!

      "title": "Keep it short and simple.",
      "content": "Keep it short and simple. While longer messages can be touching, they might not hold the focus of a new-found teen. Try to keep your birthday message to a 16-year-old short and to the point. Aim for a paragraph of 5 sentences at most. The shorter the message, the easier it’ll be for the birthday boy or girl to engage. You know the birthday person better than us! So, if you know they’d like something lengthier that speaks from the heart, go for it. Follow your heart and do what you think is right."
