Use a chair that's ergonomically designed for proper support, meaning it supports all of your back, even the curve at the bottom. Also, make sure it's designed for your height and weight.

      "title": "Adjust your computer monitor to help with your posture.",
      "content": "Adjust your computer monitor to help with your posture. If you work on computers at an office, angle the monitor slightly upward so that it forces you to sit up. However, don't set it so high that you push your chin out to see it. You may need to move your chair up or down if you can't angle the monitor properly. Adjust your chair and your position so that your arms are flexed, not straight out. Aim for roughly a 75- to 90-degree angle at the elbows. If they are too straight, you're too far back, and if they are more than 90 degrees, you're either sitting too close or you're slouching."

      "content": "Make adjustments to your seat to maintain good posture while driving. Adjust your seat to maintain a proper distance from the pedals and steering wheel. If you're leaning forward, pointing your toes, or reaching for the wheel, you're too far away. If you are bunched up with your chin on top of the steering wheel, you're too close. Use lumbar support for the curve of your back when possible. Adjust the head rest so the middle of your head rests against it. Your head shouldn't be more than 4 inches (10 cm) away from the headrest while driving. Keep your back against the seat and your head against the head rest. Your knees should be at the same level as your hips or slightly above. Good posture is also important for safety in the car. Your car's protective systems protect you best when you are sitting properly in the seat."

      "title": "Use a wall to teach yourself correct posture.",
      "content": "Use a wall to teach yourself correct posture. Stand with your back against a door or wall. Just touch the wall with the back of your head, your shoulders, and your butt. Your heels should be 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) away from the wall. Slide your hand behind your back to check for space. You should be able to slide your hand behind your back but only by a little bit. If you have more space than that, pull your belly button back towards your spine to help flatten your back a little. If you can't slide your hand behind your back, arch your back so that you can. Try to hold this position as you move away from the wall, rechecking as needed. Away from the wall, if you simply put your head back, tuck your chin in, and pull your abdominals in, then you will find that your spine, shoulders, and chest automatically go into the positions that they're supposed to be in for good posture. Think about it: If you put your head back and tuck your chin in, then your chest will automatically be out front. And the good change in spine position will automatically push your shoulders back, to the correct position, and encourage the proper curve to the middle of your back (near the bottom of the rib cage). Then, it becomes quick and easy to think: \"Head back, chin tucked, abs in.\" Go back to the wall again and notice that the wall actually guides you to achieve this very posture of \"Head back, chin tucked, abs in\""

If you sleep on your side, place a pillow between your knees and pull them up towards your chest. Pick a pillow for your head that keeps your spine straight, or use a full body pillow."

      "content": "Use stretching for a sore neck or back. Tilt or stretch your head in all 4 directions over your shoulders (forward, back, left, right), and gently massage your neck. Avoid rolling your head in a circle, as it may cause further strain. For another exercise, get on your hands and knees. Curl your back upwards, like a cat, and then do the opposite, dropping your stomach down and curling your back downwards. Repeat the exercises a few times each day. Doing them in the morning helps your body stretch out the muscle lethargy from sleep. Doing periodically throughout the day will help to raise your energy level."
