      "title": "Fold in both sides of a dollar bill, leaving a small gap.",
      "content": "Fold in both sides of a dollar bill, leaving a small gap. Place a dollar bill face-up on a flat surface. Grab the left side of the bill and fold into the center, creasing it along the leftmost edge of the center portrait. Repeat the same process with the right side of your dollar bill. Try to keep both folds equal, so your money flower will look consistent and smooth. [1] X Research source If possible, use fresh dollar bills for this project—old money will be wrinkly and more tricky to crease and fold. There should be about 1 to 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (2.5 to 3.8 cm) of space between the edges of both folds. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold all 4 corners into a triangle.",
      "content": "Fold all 4 corners into a triangle. Grab each corner and fold it forward into a smaller triangle. Note that each side of the dollar bill will now resemble a larger triangle and have a pointed edge. [3] X Research source At this point, the portrait in the center of your dollar bill will still be visible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Crease the folded dollar in half lengthwise to make a trapezoid.",
      "content": "Crease the folded dollar in half lengthwise to make a trapezoid. Pinch both sides of the folded dollar bill together to make a long, horizontal fold. At this point, your dollar bill will look like a long trapezoid. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Create 2 more folded dollar bills to serve as the flower petals.",
      "content": "Create 2 more folded dollar bills to serve as the flower petals. Repeat the folding process again until you have 3 folded trapezoids. Note that each dollar bill will create 2 petals, which will allow you to make a flower with 6 petals total. [5] X Research source It’s okay if the folds aren’t perfect on your first go around! The more you fold, the better you’ll get!"

    {
      "title": "Stack your folded bills and tie them together.",
      "content": "Stack your folded bills and tie them together. Loop a thin, 8 in (20 cm) section of wire in half around the center of your folded money. Twist the wire around itself to hold the dollar bills together securely. [6] X Research source The extra wire will help attach the flower to the tree. If you’re planning on making multiple money flowers, cut several 8 in (20 cm) sections of wire with a pair of wire cutters."

      "title": "Expand the folds so they resemble open flower petals.",
      "content": "Expand the folds so they resemble open flower petals. Pinch and open all 6 folded ends of the dollar bill. Try to expand the petals as much as you can until the edges are touching. [7] X Research source At this point, your dollar bill will look like a flower blossom with 6 petals."

      "title": "Create a fake “tree” with a branch, some plaster, and a tin can.",
      "content": "Create a fake “tree” with a branch, some plaster, and a tin can. Mix 2 cups (400 g) of plaster powder with 1 c (240 mL) of water until it forms a thick mixture, then pour the plaster into the empty can. Place the thickest end of a real or fake tree branch in the middle of the plaster and hold it in place. Wait a few minutes for the plaster to harden—at this point, feel free to let go of the stick and wait for the plaster to dry completely. [8] X Research source For more specific guidance, double-check the label on your plaster container. Try to leave 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of empty space between the plaster and the rim of the can. Ideally, look for a branch that’s at least 18 in (46 cm) and has a lot of offshoots, which you can use to hang up the money flowers."

      "title": "Cover the base of the fake tree with paper and chocolate coins.",
      "content": "Cover the base of the fake tree with paper and chocolate coins. Pick up the plaster-filled can and transfer it to a colorful vase, bucket, planter, or other type of container. Crumple up some old packing paper and arrange it on top of the dried plaster, so it looks like your money tree is planted in real soil. As a finishing touch, layer chocolate coins in a thick layer on top of the crumpled paper. [9] X Research source You can find chocolate coins at most candy or grocery stores."

      "content": "Glue your money flowers onto the branch offshoots. Flip your flower over so the bottom side faces up. Place a dot of hot glue on the point where all 3 dollar bills intersect, then press the blossom in place onto 1 of the branch’s offshoots. Wait several seconds for the glue to dry, then let go of the flower. For extra security, twist the flower wire around the offshoot, which will provide extra support. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Dig up a shiny spot of land on your island. Walk around your entire island and look for a small, glowing spot on the ground. Press the arrow buttons on your console to equip your shovel, then use this tool to dig at the site of the glowing spot. [11] X Research source It may take you a few minutes to find the glowing spot. The game will spawn 1 glowing spot per day, which gives you a daily opportunity to grow a money tree."

      "content": "Bury up to 99,000 Bells in the glowing hole. Open up your inventory and select a bag of Bells. Select the “bury” option, and watch as your villager buries the Bells with shovel. At this point, a tiny sapling will appear in the ground! [12] X Research source If you don’t have any Bells in your bag, select the button in your inventory that displays how much in-game money you have. Once you do this, a menu will pop up that will let you transfer large amounts of Bells to your inventory. You can use your shovel to dig up the sapling and plant it elsewhere, if you’d like. The item will register in your inventory as a “nursery money tree.”"

      "title": "Wait multiple in-game days for your money tree to grow.",
      "content": "Wait multiple in-game days for your money tree to grow. Keep in mind that Animal Crossing games are played in real time, so you’ll have to wait at least 3 whole days before your money tree starts to grow. If you’d like to speed up the process, go to your console’s “time and date” settings and change the time, which will trick your game into thinking several days have passed. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake the tree once you see Bell bags appear in the branches.",
      "content": "Shake the tree once you see Bell bags appear in the branches. Check on your growing money tree each day and see how much it’s grown. Within a week, you’ll see 3 bags of Bells growing from the branches. The total Bell yield will depend on how many Bells you planted originally, so don’t be disappointed if you don’t get as much currency as you expected. [14] X Research source You can plant a new money tree each day, so there are plenty of opportunities to try again! Use caution when inviting strangers over to your islands. Some players may be inconsiderate and try to steal the Bells off your money tree."
