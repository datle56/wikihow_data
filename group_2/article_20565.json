      "title": "Find a popular video.",
      "content": "Find a popular video. The video must be popular enough that it has at least a few hundred thousand views, but not so many that the video itself is no longer rising. You need to leave space for the video itself to grow."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch the whole video.",
      "content": "Watch the whole video. Take note of anything like which you would be willing to comment on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the comments.",
      "content": "Check the comments. If you see a comment that is gaining a lot of popularity, reply to that comment with something witty. Your comment could get lots of likes, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add to the discussion with a useful comment.",
      "content": "Add to the discussion with a useful comment. Useless comments rarely hit the top. Remember that whatever you are saying is something people will want others to see."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remember that getting a popular comment doesn't happen every time.",
      "content": "Remember that getting a popular comment doesn't happen every time. Getting likes is mostly luck. Bad timing can render even the most useful comment a bottom comment. Always remember that for something to trend, you have to be lucky enough for it to strike a chord amongst the viewers, and you must be persistent."

      "title": "Talk about a background scene in the video that few (if any) people noticed.",
      "content": "Talk about a background scene in the video that few (if any) people noticed. If you can point out something funny or interesting, people will be more likely to thumbs up and reply to your comment. Make sure to include a timestamp so people can jump right to that point in the video."
    },
    {
      "title": "Point out an easter egg in a game or movie trailer.",
      "content": "Point out an easter egg in a game or movie trailer. If the game or movie is a sequel, you could make a viral comment by pointing out any fun easter eggs that you notice. Make sure to include a timestamp so other watchers can view this timestamp as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Praise the video and/or its creator.",
      "content": "Praise the video and/or its creator. If you especially liked or resonated with a video, write a sincere and thoughtful comment about why you like it or how it helped you. Other users may like the comment if they agree, and the creator may even reply or pin the comment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a (nice) joke about the video content.",
      "content": "Make a (nice) joke about the video content. Avoid being rude or offensive. If you've been watching this YouTube channel for a while, bring up an inside joke from a past video if it applies to the current video. Other long-time fans may find it funny and will interact with your comment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a punny comment.",
      "content": "Make a punny comment. A pun can become a massively popular comment, especially if it's clever or funny. Make a pun based on the video's title or something the YouTuber says in the video for the best results."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reference a meme.",
      "content": "Reference a meme. If something that happens in the YouTube video reminds you of a meme, make a comment about it! For the best chance at writing a top comment, reference a recent and/or topical meme, if possible. Avoid super old memes, because some users might not get the joke."
    },
    {
      "title": "Supply additional information.",
      "content": "Supply additional information. If the YouTube video is more informational than entertaining, you may be able to provide some additional information or anecdotes. For example, if a video is about visiting Japan and you live in Japan, you might comment some travel tips, places to go, or correct some myths that some people have about visiting your country."

    {
      "title": "Ask for a thumbs up.",
      "content": "Ask for a thumbs up. While this isn't very subtle, you can ask for a thumbs up to get a top comment. The key is to add a reason for a reader to click the thumbs up button. Some examples include \"Thumbs up if you're going to buy this game on day one!\" or \"Like this comment to show your appreciation for [the YouTuber's name].\""

      "content": "YouTube's top comments work based off of a ranking algorithm. The algorithm takes into account how many likes and dislikes a comment has, how many replies it's gotten, and what date it was posted. YouTube has not gone into detail about how this algorithm works, but users have done individual research to figure out some of the details. [1] X Research source Your own comments will always be at the top of the comment section, even if they are not top comments. To see where your comment actually ranks, you'll need to have someone else check for you, or log out of your account and check."
