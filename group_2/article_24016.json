Ceramic tiles can be smashed with a hammer and then removed. Try to hammer the ceramic in a localized area, starting from the middle and moving out.

      "title": "Use a long level to make sure the floor area is level.",
      "content": "Use a long level to make sure the floor area is level. Marble is a very soft tile and can be particularly susceptible to cracking if it is not installed on a level surface. Use the longest level possible to make sure your floor is level. You can try sanding down any bumps that raise the floor or filling in any depressions in the floor surface with thin-set cement. Wait for the cement to completely dry before continuing. You may also need to lay a plywood subfloor to make the floor level. Marble should not be installed on a floor that has a change in height that is more than ¼ inch (6 mm) in a distance of 10 feet (3 m)."

      "title": "Inspect the tiles.",
      "content": "Inspect the tiles. Run your finger nails over the tiles to make sure there are not cracks or gaps in the polished surface of the tile. You should not use any tiles that have these cracks or gaps because they might break in the process of installation or use. Most hardware stores will accept exchanges of tiles that have cracks or gaps in them."

      "content": "Measure the length and width of the floor and create a layout on paper. Plan your installation on paper using the floor dimensions and sizes of the tiles. Decide on your pattern for laying the tiles. You can lay them in rows or in a pyramid-like structure or in other patterns. Draw the pattern to scale on paper. You want to keep most tiles full-sized so that you do not have to cut them. You also do not want strips of tile that are less than 2 inches (5 cm) wide."

      "title": "Mark the center of your floor.",
      "content": "Mark the center of your floor. Measure the center of each wall and make a light mark with a pencil. Then take a chalk snap line and hold it to either end of the centers of two opposing walls. Lower the line and snap it to the floor to make a chalk line. Do this for the other two walls as well. Where the two chalk lines meet is the center of your floor. You usually want tiles to radiate from the center of your floor."

This dry-run allows you to identify areas where you will need to cut tiles to fit and will help you determine the best place to start laying the tile based on your pattern and the shape of the area you plan to tile. If the gap between the last complete tile and the wall is less than 2 inches (5 cm) then you should move the center tile over. This makes the strip of tile in this area wider, which will look nicer when you lay your tiles."

      "content": "Apply a layer of thin-set adhesive on the floor surface using a notched trowel. Be sure to wear heavy-duty work gloves and work one section of the floor at a time. The adhesive should be thick enough that you can use the notched edge of the trowel to make grooves in the adhesive without showing the floor below, but thin enough that it does not push up between the tiles. The grooves ensure that the adhesive spreads evenly on the back of the tiles. Choose the adhesive recommended for your type of marble. Ask at the location where you purchase your tiles about the proper adhesive to use."

      "content": "Lay marble tiles firmly in the thin-set adhesive. Lay the tiles on top of the adhesive within 10 minutes of applying the adhesive. Be careful not to slide the tiles into place or get adhesive on the top of the tiles. Sliding the tiles into place will push up the adhesive and make the tiles uneven, causing them to crack. Adhesive will be difficult to remove from the tops of the tiles."

      "content": "Position the tiles in place using spacers. Use spacers to create the correct spacing between the tiles and keep them even with straight lines along the rows and columns. You should use 1/8 inch (3 mm) marble tile spacers. Spacers help ensure proper placement of the tiles."

Take a length of wood and lay it across the tops of the marble tiles, using a hammer to lightly tap the wood down. This ensures that all the tiles are at the same level. Use the piece of wood in both directions along the grid to make all the tiles exactly the same level."

      "content": "Use a wet saw to cut the tiles to fit in the edges along the walls or special spaces. In order to minimize the risk of tiles breaking when they are being cut, saw three-fourths of the length of the tile, turn the tile around and then cut the remaining length. Repeat the process until you have cut all the specially sized tiles and placed them into the adhesive. You can usually rent a wet saw for a day from a local hardware store or tool rental company."

This seal is also important because marble is very porous and grout can cause stains in the tiles. Apply the sealing agent over the tops of the marble. Even if you prefer the color and look of unsealed marble you can use a “grout release”-type sealer to prevent grout from sticking to the marble tiles."

Be sure to wear a dust mask, safety goggles, and heavy-duty work gloves. Wear a long-sleeve shirt to avoid any possible damage to your skin from contact with the grout. Mix only enough as will be used in 15-20 minutes of work or else the extra can dry out and harden."
