      "content": "Bathe your Golden Retriever with warm water and a quality dog shampoo. There is some debate whether you should do this before or after you trim its coat. If your Golden Retriever is really dirty and smelly, go ahead and bathe it before you groom it. If your pup has been bathed recently, you can probably skip the bath or wait until after you groom the dog in order to get any excess fur off at the end. Lather the shampoo all over your dog's body, rinse thoroughly and rub dry with a large towel.

A Golden Retriever doesn't have a short, tight coat, but instead has some length to it.

As you trim, move the thinning shears with the direction of the growth. Using the thinning shears to trim the neck and chest will give the dog a more natural look."
