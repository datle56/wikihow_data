      "content": "Choose a species for your fursona to be. Do your research and figure out what animals you like most or what animal you identify with. There are tons of animals out there to choose from, including reptiles of all kinds, avians (birds and anything with feathers), amphibians, horses, goats, skunks, and thousands of other species. Don't be afraid to venture out from the idea of just sticking to a \"generic\" species. You can even mix animals, use a fantasy creature, or even make up your own. If you can't decide on just one, you're also free to make a hybrid or have multiple fursonas. Want to learn more about other people's fursonas? Check out wikiHow's \"My fursona is a cat\" forum !"

      "content": "Think of a design for your fursona, like the coat color and/or markings on it. This can be as natural-looking or as crazy as you want it to be. Your fursona can also have tattoos, piercings, patches of different colored fur/feathers/scales/skinâ€”even extra tails if you'd like! It's completely up to you."

      "title": "Think of specific details that you would like this fursona to have.",
      "content": "Think of specific details that you would like this fursona to have. Do they wear clothing? Do they have anything interesting or noteworthy? Does your fursona have feral (quadrupedal) proportions, or is it more anthropomorphic, with human-like proportions? Come up with details like these when making your fursona. Sketch out what your animal looks like. This can help you decide on certain character traits you want your fursona to have. If you can't draw too well, search for bases on FurAffinity, Medibang Paint, or DeviantArt and color on them. (Just make sure to credit the base artist.)"

      "content": "Decide the aspects of your fursona's personality. If you're only making this fursona to have a representation of yourself as an animal within the subculture, you're already done. If not, think about new traits for them, such as what they like and dislike, their good character traits, and their downfalls. It may be tempting to create a perfect and cool character, but a fursona with both positive traits as well as shortcomings is usually more interesting and relatable."

      "title": "Think of a name for your fursona.",
      "content": "Think of a name for your fursona. This could be your name, or you can pick a name that you find interesting. Nobody can claim a fursona name, so don't feel pressured to make a \"unique\" name if you don't want to. If you're having trouble coming up with a name, feel free to use a random name generator, think of words (or even words in other languages) that reflect something about your character, or ask the community for help."
