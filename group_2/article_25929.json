As a Venus-driven sign, Libra is extremely romantic and very motivated by aesthetics, so he will go all out to make the moment special for him and his Aquarius lover: candles, soft lighting, rose petals, the whole shebang."

      "content": "Aquarius will be turned on by Libra’s passion and intellect. First and foremost, both Libra and Aquarius are aroused by each other’s extreme intelligence, but physicality and passion come in a close second. While Libra may have caught Aquarius’s attention by proving he was intellectual enough to stimulate her, his sensuality is what takes them from friends to passionate lovers. Being so focused on ideas and abstractions, Aquarius often struggles to get out of her head during sex, but romantic Libra knows how to draw out her sexual side ."

      "content": "Aquarius needs independence, and Libra is happy to accommodate. Though these signs love spending time together and chatting into the early dawn, Aquarius may require a hefty dose of solitude. Both Aquarius and Libra are particularly good at communicating and aren't prone to jealousy, meaning that when Aquarius needs some alone time, Libra doesn't take it to heart. Both signs are likely to get as much breathing room as they need in their relationship. However, Libra can occasionally take too much space if he begins to feel unhappy or restless. Aquarius, keep an eye out to distinguish whether your Libra needs breathing room to maintain his independence, or whether he is pulling away from you. When they aren't socializing or talking, these smarties love to read and learn new things. Reading together is a great way for them to maintain their solitude while still spending quality time together."

      "content": "Aquarius will help her Libra be more confident. While Libra men can be charming and diplomatic, their diplomacy can sometimes cause them to sacrifice too much of themselves to satisfy others.

      "content": "Libra will help to bring out Aquarius’s warmth. Aquarius women are very unique, and proud of it. They know how to stand up for themselves and not default to the status quo. But while an Aqua woman’s uniqueness and confidence are great traits, they can also make her seem standoffish or even cold at times. Libra will use his natural warmth and diplomacy to balance her out, drawing out her softer, less intense side. While both Libra and Aquarius love to socialize, Aquarius can sometimes default to watching other people rather than actually engaging with them! With Libra's encouragement, she can show off her soft side and connect more easily with others."

      "title": "Libra may struggle with restlessness.",
      "content": "Libra may struggle with restlessness. The dark side of being the sign of “balance” is that sometimes Libra will jump back and forth between 2 ideas or desires: when he’s in a relationship, he will fondly recall the days he was single—but when he’s single, he’ll crave the intimacy of a relationship. Aquarius is one of the few signs in the zodiac who really understands how to date a Libra guy , but his tendency to flip-flop is something both parties need to be aware of and something he will have to work on overcoming. Despite his restlessness, Libra can be very committed. His desire to “escape” the bonds of a relationship tends to be periodic and short-lived, and it will fade over time. That said, he and his Aquarius should talk about his conflicting feelings when they do arise. As they are both naturally great communicators, this is unlikely to be a severe issue in the relationship. Aquarius, take notice if your Libra man starts to pull away. Libras need a lot of space in a relationship, but if he has stopped communicating with you, this is a sign he is feeling restless or dissatisfied. Libra, if you do end your relationship with Aquarius, be sure it’s what you really want, as it’s hard to win an Aquarius back!"

Libra and Aquarius's shared love of ideas and ability to parse through complex thoughts is what draws them together. Unfortunately, Aquarius may struggle to stop thinking, which may leave romantic and flirtatious Libra feeling a little frustrated at times. [8] X Research source Libra's undivided attention for his Aquarius lover will make it easier for her to feel romantic around him compared to other signs, but she'll still have to work on her seduction techniques. It may be helpful for both signs to sit down together and discuss their love languages to establish concrete ways of showing and receiving affection for and from each another."

      "content": "Libra’s attraction to refinement can make him judgmental at times. While Aquarius seems to be a perfect fit, the more intimate the two become, the more likely her “unrefined” qualities are to show. Libra will have to work on being less judgmental and demanding in order for both parties to be comfortable expressing their full, authentic selves, whether they’re gabbing away at a party like Dorothy Parker at the Algonquin or, well, lounging in their sweats watching reality TV. Libra men tend to be handsome, well-kept, and refined, and they demand this of their partners as well. But this expectation for constant refinement is unrealistic, which may contribute to Libra’s occasional flightiness."
