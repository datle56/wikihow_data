      "title": "Choose your sugar.",
      "content": "Choose your sugar. White, granulated sugar is the default for simple syrup, but you do have other options. Superfine sugar reduces the risk of crystallization. A raw brown sugar such as turbinado or demerara creates a brown, molasses-flavored syrup good for rum or bourbon cocktails. Do not use confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar). This usually contains cornstarch, which does not dissolve in water. The syrup will be cloudy or grainy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure water and sugar.",
      "content": "Measure water and sugar. Measure the sugar and water and combine in a saucepan. Use an equal amount of both ingredients for a basic syrup. This is a great option if you don't want to risk anything, since it will give you a low margin of error for the recipe. For a more concentrated syrup, use up to twice as much sugar as water. A more concentrated syrup has a higher risk of crystallizing back into solids, but will last longer in the fridge. Some bartenders prefer a concentrated syrup because it can sweeten a cocktail without adding too much water. For greater accuracy, measure ingredients by weight on a kitchen scale. Using volume measurements (cups or milliliters) won't cause major issue, but you'll end up with about ⅞ the amount of sugar. Try melting a thin layer of sugar at a time rather than adding a huge amount of sugar all at once."

      "title": "Heat and stir.",
      "content": "Heat and stir. Turn on the heat under your sugar-water mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until all the sugar crystals have dissolved. The sugar usually dissolves within a few minutes, but a large batch may take longer. Do not let the mixture boil. If you lose too much water, the sugar may not be able to dissolve. For very concentrated syrups (at least a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water), stir the last bits of water gently. Too much stirring when the maximum amount of sugar has dissolved can cause crystals to reform. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wash sugar off the side.",
      "content": "Wash sugar off the side. A single grain of sugar left in the syrup can create a large mass of solid crystals. If you see any sugar left on the side of the pot, brush it down to the syrup using a wet pastry brush. Alternatively, just put the lid on the pot for a few minutes, and the condensed water should run down the sides and clean them. Because the lid traps most of the water vapor, it's all right if the syrup boils for a short time while the lid is on. To be safe, stick with a brief simmer."

    {
      "title": "Set aside the syrup to cool.",
      "content": "Set aside the syrup to cool. it will be ready to store once it reaches room temperature. If the sugar crystallizes when it cools, either too much water boiled away, or not all the sugar dissolved. Add a little water and heat it up again."

    {
      "title": "Sterilize a container.",
      "content": "Sterilize a container. Bring a small, separate pot of water to a boil. Once boiled, pour directly into a clean jar or bottle. Pour boiling water over the lid of the container as well. Sterilizing the container will reduce the chance that your syrup re-crystallizes, and prolong shelf life. Unless using immediately, store in a clear container so you can watch for signs of mold."

    {
      "title": "Store the syrup.",
      "content": "Store the syrup. Dump the hot water out of the container, and immediately pour in the room temperature syrup. Fasten the lid and store in the refrigerator. A 1:1 syrup stays good for about one month. A 2:1 syrup stays good for about six months. To keep your syrup useful for much longer, stir in a spoonful of high-proof vodka. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Make syrup without heat.",
      "content": "Make syrup without heat. Sugar will dissolve in room temperature water, if you shake it hard enough. Because there's no heat to sterilize the syrup, this version will only last about two weeks. As far as taste goes, bartenders have lined up on both sides of the hot-cold debate. Give it a whirl and decide for yourself: [3] X Research source Combine equal parts sugar and water in a sealed container. (Using superfine sugar may shorten the shaking time.) [4] X Research source Shake for three minutes, then let rest for one minute. Shake for another 30 seconds, or until all sugar is dissolved."

    {
      "title": "Infuse with flavor.",
      "content": "Infuse with flavor. Simmer the syrup with herbs or spices for about 30–45 minutes to extract flavors. Try cinnamon and nutmeg syrup for winter holiday desserts, or basil syrup for sophisticated cocktails. If using herbs, remove them as soon as they turn brown. Strain out leaves once the syrup is done. The addition of other ingredients may shorten the shelf life. Stir a spoonful of vodka into the cooled syrup to prevent mold."

      "title": "Create syrup du gomme.",
      "content": "Create syrup du gomme. Adding gum arabic to the syrup creates a silky texture, and lowers the chance of crystallization. This old-fashioned recipe is making a small comeback due to the appealing texture it lends to cocktails: [5] X Research source Bring water nearly to a boil. Slowly mix in an equal amount gum arabic, by weight. Stir until gluey and mostly combined. Let sit for two to three hours, off the heat. Stir again to work in lumps. Start making sugar syrup, as above. Use twice as much water as you did for the gum arabic. Once sugar is dissolved, reduce to a simmer. Stir in gum arabic mixture slowly, while stirring. Let cool, then skim off and discard scum from the top of the syrup."

    {
      "title": "Caramelize the syrup.",
      "content": "Caramelize the syrup. Add this dark caramel flavor to whiskey cocktails or a bittersweet chocolate cake. Wear gloves and stand back from the pan, as molten sugar can cause severe burns. Try it out as follows: Heat the sugar (alone) in a stainless steel saucepan, stirring once every 30 seconds. For caramel syrup: Add water as soon as the sugar melts. This will cause spattering and steaming, so stand back as you pour. Stir rapidly and constantly until syrup forms. For burnt caramel syrup: Turn on stove ventilation or open windows — there will likely be smoke. Wait until sugar forms thick bubbles, than (in another 15 seconds or so) turns dark. Add water and stir carefully. It may take a while for the solid sugar to dissolve."
