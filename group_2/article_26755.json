      "title": "Determine the size of the image.",
      "content": "Determine the size of the image. Decide the location of the airbrush stenciled image and measure the space for the image. Create or scale the image to size. For example, on a t-shirt, decide if a large stenciled image covers the entire back of the shirt or a small stenciled image is on the front corner of the shirt."

      "title": "Draw or print the image.",
      "content": "Draw or print the image. Draw the image or print the image on a piece of paper from the computer. With a computer, scan an existing image or download an image to print . Print the image in black and white. [1] X Research source If you're new to airbrushing, begin with a simple design. Draw or print an image that doesn't have too much detail to cut out. Glossy paper may be thick enough to use as a stencil. Just print and cut the image out and use it as your stencil."

    {
      "title": "Shrink the design",
      "content": "Shrink the design . With a computer or photocopier, reduce the size of the image to fit the item being airbrushed. Crop or shrink the image until it's the size you want. Use computer editing software to adjust detailed images instead of photocopying them. Photocopiers can blur intricate details."

      "title": "Use a printing service to enlarge the image.",
      "content": "Use a printing service to enlarge the image. If an image needs to be made bigger or an image is larger than your printer paper, use image-editing software to enlarge it or pay a printing service to print it. [2] X Research source Professional printing services are a good choice if you are printing an image in a large file format. Ask a local printing service about costs before you agree to print the image since prices may vary."

      "title": "Cut your stencil material to size.",
      "content": "Cut your stencil material to size. Get a heavy, smooth illustrator paper (such as Bristol), a sturdy piece of acetate, or non-fusible heavyweight interfacing (such as Pellon Peltex). Cut the material so that the sized image will fit on it. Leave 2\"-3\" (5-7.5 cm) beyond the image as a border. This prevents overspray from getting onto the item being airbrushed. [3] X Research source Acetate or interfacing is sturdier than paper or cardboard. If the stencil is to be reused, choose the longer-lasting material. With paper or cardboard, you can draw the image directly on the stencil material. The downside of using paper, cardboard, or even wood is that they are usually one time use stencils, because they will suck up the paint and can be a real mess to transport."

      "content": "Tape image to the stencil material. Lay the image on the chosen stencil material. With masking tape secure the image. There is no need to tape along the entire edge. Just ensure that the image won't slide around on the stencil material. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a utility knife to cut out images on stencil material. Place taped image on stencil material onto a cutting mat. With a utility knife carefully cut the image outline. Cut out any detail highlights wanted on the stencil. [5] X Research source The utility knife is useful for making stencil details. For example, to cut out circles, swirls, or defining lines within the image, use different blades to get the desired effect."

      "title": "Remove tape and image from the stencil.",
      "content": "Remove tape and image from the stencil. Peel away and discard tape from the edges of the taped-down image. Liftoff image to reveal the stencil. Pick up a paper, acetate, or thick fabric stencil and gently push on it to pop out the cut image. You now have positive and negative stencils. [6] X Research source The negative stencil is the material surrounding the image cut out while the positive stencil is the solid image cut out. You can easily use either of these popular types of stencils."

If the airbrushing fabric, smooth fabric completely and lay it flat on the ground. Do tape the stencil down so it doesn't move while airbrushing. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray back of the stencil with adhesive, if necessary. If using acetate, thin paper, or non-fusible heavyweight interfacing (Pellon Peltex), turn the stencil over and spray it lightly with stencil adhesive spray. Let adhesive rest for a few minutes. [8] X Research source Stencil adhesive spray is available at craft supply or hardware stores. If you don't let the adhesive rest, a residue will remain on the airbrushed item."

Slowly lift away the stencil and let the image dry. [9] X Research source Protect fabric from airbrush overspray by blocking off the rest of the fabric with taped-down plastic sheeting on the item. Remember to wear a respirator when using the airbrush."

Frisket film is a transparent sheet with a slightly sticky backing that can be placed directly onto hard surfaces and removed without damaging existing paint jobs. Buy frisket at craft supply stores.

With a sharp utility knife apply a little pressure to cut the outline of the image through the frisket. If you press too hard, you will cut the material that is being airbrushed. [13] X Research source Lay frisket directly onto printed photo paper, heavyweight paper, or cardboard. Frisket is a great choice to make a detailed stencil. For simpler stencils, use paper, acetate, or cardboard instead."

Use fingertips to slowly pull away the frisket to reveal the image. Load airbrush with paint and airbrush over the stenciled image. [14] X Research source Remember to wear a respirator when using the airbrush. Keep the pieces of frisket film that were removed from the stencil. Put them back in place while airbrushing to keep overspray from affecting the design."
