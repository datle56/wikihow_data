      "content": "Decide how many curtains you need. For a small window, you may only need one curtain to cover the whole thing. However, if you're covering a larger window, you may want two curtains that part in the middle. For an extra-large window, you may want to consider multiple curtain panels. When you're taking your widthwise measurements, be sure to divide the final number by the number of panels you want before cutting your fabric. For instance, if you need 30 feet (9.1 m) to cover a window and you want three separate panels, each panel must be 10 feet (3 m) wide (30 ÷ 3 = 10)."

      "content": "Choose a fabric. You have a lot of choices when it comes to choosing fabrics for curtains, but you should take into account what kind of effect you want to achieve. For instance: [1] X Research source To add a bit of privacy without blocking out too much light, choose a lighter weight material that has some transparency, such as voile or linen. To block out light or drafts, choose a heavier material, such as velvet, corduroy, tapestry, or damask. For an ultra-lightweight curtain in areas where you don’t need privacy, try lace, chiffon, or organza."

      "content": "Measure and calculate the width of the fabric. Measure the width of the window you're covering from the outer edge of the frame on one side to the outer edge of the frame on the other side. Multiply that by two or 2.5, depending on how full you want the closed curtains to look. Then add another four inches (101 mm) for the side hem. [2] X Research source If you are making multiple panels, add four inches (101 mm) to each panel for the side hem."

      "content": "Measure the gap between the curtain rod and the window frame. Measure from the top of the curtain rod to the very top of the window frame. This is important because you want to ensure your curtains completely cover the top of the window. Therefore, when hung over the curtain rod, the finished tabs must be shorter than this gap."

      "title": "Measure and calculate the length of the fabric.",
      "content": "Measure and calculate the length of the fabric. First, measure the distance from the top of the curtain rod to the spot where you want the finished curtain to end. [3] X Research source Add nine inches (228 mm) to that measurement to account for the hems, [4] X Research source and then subtract four inches (101 mm) to account for the tabs. In general, curtains will hang to one of four locations: [5] X Research source Right to the floor, which is for formal or classy rooms. To the floor plus an extra one to six inches (depending on taste), for a stylish and romantic effect. To the top of the bottom window sill, which is ideal for kitchens and bathrooms. To the bottom of the window trim, which is also great for practical areas like kitchens."

      "title": "Determine how many tabs you'll need.",
      "content": "Determine how many tabs you'll need. You need one tab at each end of the curtain, and then in between you should have a tab every five to eight inches. To figure out how many tabs you need, divide the finished width of your curtain by the spacing measurement of your tabs, then add one. For instance, if you have a finished curtain of 30 inches, and you want tabs spaced at every five inches, you need seven tabs for that curtain (30 ÷ 5 + 1 = 7)."

To make this, cut out a piece of fabric that’s four inches (101 mm) wide and the length of your curtains plus two inches (51 mm). [6] X Research source"

Don’t forget to cut out the curtains, the tabs, and the tab facing. For a basic tab, cut out rectangles of fabric that are five inches by nine inches (127 mm by 228 mm). This will leave you with tabs that are two inches by eight inches (203 mm), and folded tabs that are four inches (101 mm) long. [7] X Research source"

Pin the sides in place, and use the sewing machine to sew a straight stitch along the lengthwise edges of the fabric. Use a half-inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance, and don’t forget to backstitch at the beginning and end of every new seam.
