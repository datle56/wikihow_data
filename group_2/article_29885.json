      "content": "Gather your supplies and put on your safety gear. Smoke bombs can be made with a simple concoction of potassium nitrate and sugar. By mixing these ingredients and melting them together, you create a flammable product that produces whirls of smoke when you light it on fire. You’ll also need a cast iron skillet and some baking soda. Adding 1 tbsp (17 g) of baking soda will make the smoke burn a little bit longer. [1] X Research source For safety gear, get a pair of latex gloves, goggles , and a filter mask to protect yourself from the smoke. [2] X Research source What you’ll need: 3 tbsp (51 g) of potassium nitrate, 2 tbsp (25 g) of sugar, 1 tbsp (17 g) of baking soda, a cast iron skillet, a cardboard toilet paper roll, a Visco fuse or stormproof match, protective equipment (latex gloves, goggles, mask). Use an old cast iron skillet that you don’t plan on cooking with in the future. The potassium nitrate mixture may ruin it. You can get potassium nitrate , also called saltpeter or stump remover, at your local garden store or online. It’s important to wear your safety gear. Contact with potassium nitrate can cause eye and skin irritation. Breathing it in can irritate your nose and cause sneezing and coughing. [3] X Research source Potassium nitrate causes a unique purple flame. To color the smoke, you can add dye to your smoke bomb (more on that in a few steps). Is the smoke toxic? The ingredients in this DIY smoke bomb aren’t necessarily toxic, but can cause burns to your skin or lung damage if inhaled."

      "content": "Cover one end of the toilet paper tube with duct tape. Before you make your potassium nitrate mixture, you’ll need to prepare your cardboard tube. Put 2 pieces of tape on top of the hole so it’s completely covered. Then, secure those two pieces with a longer tape strip around the base. This will ensure that the smoke bomb mixture won’t leak out when you pour it into the tube. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix the potassium nitrate and sugar in your skillet, then heat for 15 minutes. Measure out the potassium nitrate and of sugar, then pour it into your cast iron skillet and mix it together with a spoon until they are completely combined. Heat the pan on the stove over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes. While the mixture is heating up, stir it constantly until it’s completely melted. [5] X Research source As the sugar caramelizes, it should take on a brown or black color and form a thick, gooey texture like melted caramel. Do not overcook the mixture and take care not to set it on fire. If it starts to smoke in the pan, turn the heat down immediately. The ratio of potassium nitrate to sugar doesn’t have to be exact. A 1:1 ratio burns slowly but is harder to light, while a ratio with more potassium nitrate than sugar lights more easily but burns faster."

      "content": "Add one spoonful of baking soda if you want the bomb to burn slowly. This step is technically optional, but you can add a spoonful of baking soda before you take it off the heat. The baking soda will moderate the reaction, making the smoke bomb burn a little bit slower. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Add 3 tbsp (60 g) of organic, powdered dye if you’d like colored smoke. This step is also optional, but if you’d like a specific color of smoke, add about 3 tbsp of your preferred color. These dyes are available online and in some craft and hobby stores. [7] X Research source Do not use common water-based dye, as this won’t color the smoke and may dampen the smoking reaction. Any color will work, but some say that blue and orange dye are the most vibrant and effective. Alternatively, some DIY smoke bomb makers prefer to melt colored wax crayons in the pan before adding the potassium nitrate and sugar. When combined, this creates a colored smoke bomb mix."

      "content": "Take the mixture off the heat and pour it into the cardboard tube. Turn off the heat on the stove and use a spoon to get as much of the mixture as you can into the tube. [8] X Research source Work quickly because the mixture is going to harden. To make it easier to pour, you can use a funnel. Or, you can place the mixture in a small plastic bag, cut off one corner, and squeeze it into the tube. When you’re pouring the mixture in the cardboard tube, make sure to pack it tightly. If it’s not, the smoke won’t burn smoothly when you light the smoke bomb."

Cut 3 in (7.6 cm) of the fuse and then stick one end into the middle of the tube through the mixture. [9] X Research source Make sure at least 1 in (2.5 cm) of the fuse is sticking out of the mixture so you have enough room to light it. Or, stick the non-flammable end of a long stormproof match into the mixture. Afterward, let your mixture sit in a well-ventilated area so that it can cool down. It might take an hour or so to completely solidify."

Put your finished smoke bomb in an outdoor area clear of buildings, trees, other people, and pets (you should never light a smoke bomb indoors!). Use a lighter to light the end of the fuse. Move away quickly as soon as the fuse is lit to avoid smoke inhalation or injury. Your smoke bomb will produce a large cloud of dark smoke. [10] X Research source Potassium nitrate smoke bombs burn very violently. So make sure you place it in a clear, open area away from anything that can catch fire."

      "content": "Gather 4 celluloid ping pong balls . For this method, you’ll need a few ping pong balls. These balls are made of nitrocellulose, which is a highly flammable compound used in celluloid. One ball will make up the actual smoke bomb, while the others will be cut up and placed inside of the first ping pong ball to add more smoke when you set it off. Choose balls that are the same color, because the color you choose will end up being the color of the smoke. [11] X Research source What you’ll need: 4 ping pong balls, aluminum foil, a screwdriver, scissors, a pencil. It’s important that you use celluloid ping-pong balls instead of plastic ones. You can tell the difference between the two because the plastic balls are shiny and bend easily. The celluloid ping-pong balls are typically more durable and matte. Is the smoke toxic? Yes, the fumes from burning nitrocellulose may be toxic if exposed to high enough temperatures or flames. [12] X Research source Note: Celluloid ping pong balls are rare today because of the very fact that they’re so flammable. [13] X Research source Regular plastic ping pong balls will also work, but produce less smoke that nitrocellulose."

It may not fit all the way in because you just filled the hole, so just make sure the tip of the pencil is touching the outside of the ball. Then, get a piece of foil that is at least 6 by 6 inches (15 by 15 cm). Put the ping pong ball in the center of the foil square, and wrap the foil tightly around the ball and pencil until it takes its shape. [16] X Research source The only purpose of the pencil in this step is to create a mold for the foil, so do not completely cover it. Make sure there is a hole in the foil at the end of the pencil so you can take it out when you’re finished."

[18] X Research source Hold the smoke bomb by the top and use a lighter to light a flame right under the ping pong ball. The smoke will start to pour out of the hole in the ball and out through the chimney left by the pencil. [19] X Research source Once it starts to smoke, toss or place the smoke bomb on the ground and quickly move away. Stand a few feet back to avoid breathing in the toxic smoke."

They contain ammonium nitrate, which is a common ingredient used in garden fertilizers. Similar to potassium nitrate, it can be combined with other ingredients to create explosives. Open the pack by cutting it with a pair of scissors, remove the small water bag inside, and discard it. Pour all of the ammonium nitrate granules into a large pan or bucket. [20] X Research source What you’ll need: A cold pack with ammonium nitrate, water, 10 newspaper sheets, a bucket or pan. Is the smoke toxic? Yes. Fumes from burning ammonium nitrate can cause irritation to the skin, lungs, eyes, nose, and throat and cause other side effects when inhaled. [21] X Research source Wear gloves when you handle the granules. Ammonium nitrate is an irritant, so if it gets on your skin, wipe it off, and rinse the skin immediately. Always wash your hands thoroughly with liquid soap when you are finished."

Make sure you add just a little at a time, and gently swirl the bucket until the ammonium nitrate dissolves. [22] X Research source Stop adding water as soon as you notice all of the granules have dissolved so the solution is still concentrated. If you add too much water, you’ll end up with bombs that don’t smoke."

Secure the rolled newspaper by tying a string around them. Be careful not tie them too tight or too loose that they come apart. Take it outside in an open area, and then use a lighter to light one end of the newspaper. You will notice clouds of smoke coming out of both ends of the newspaper. [25] X Research source You may opt to experiment with different lengths and widths for your smoke bomb. If so, cut up the newspaper sheets, rip them in half, or leave them whole before rolling them up."

      "content": "Is it legal to use smoke bombs in the US? Yes, but lots of restrictions may apply based on where you live. Purchasing smoke bombs is federally legal, but some states have chosen to make it illegal to buy and/or use them. How and where you want to use them matters too. It may be legal to use a smoke bomb on a paintball course, for example, but not in a densely packed public square. [26] X Research source Other restrictions, like being 18 or needing a permit to purchase a smoke bomb, also depend on your state or municipality."

      "title": "How do smoke bombs work?",
      "content": "How do smoke bombs work? Standard smoke bombs consist of an oxidizer (potassium nitrate), a fuel (sugar), and a moderator to keep the smoke from getting too hot (baking soda). Sometimes, an organic dye is added that vaporizes to produce colored smoke. When you light the fuse, a slow and sustained chemical reaction begins that fuels the smoke: The sugar burns while the potassium nitrate intensifies the combustion. [27] X Research source"

Some of the earliest types of smoke bombs were used in medieval Japan to fight off the Mongols in the 13th century. However, the modern smoke bomb (using potassium nitrate) was officially invented in 1848 by Robert Yale. [28] X Research source One of the earliest uses of these new smoke bombs was in 1863 during the American Civil War to send signals to other troops. [29] X Research source"

      "content": "How do people use smoke bombs? Traditionally, smoke bombs have been used in warfare for communication, to mark a target area, or to create a smoke screen. They can also be used to send distress signals, like if you’re lost in the woods and need help. Besides combat, smoke bombs can also be used creatively to make backdrops for photo and video shoots, prank people, or create artistic backdrops for live performances. [30] X Research source"
