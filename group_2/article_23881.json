Before you begin, you'll want to have all of your tools and equipment handy, and make sure that any materials that will come into contact with the patient's body are fresh and sterile (especially your needles). [2] X Research source To start a typical IV line, you will need: [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Non-sterile disposable gloves “Over-the-needle\" IV catheter (typically 14-24 gauge) Bag of IV fluid Tourniquet Sterile bandage or dressing Gauze Alcohol wipes Medical tape Sharps container Sterile pad or paper (to set your tools out on)"

      "content": "Introduce yourself to the patient. An important part of the process of starting an IV is introducing yourself to the patient and explaining the procedure that's about to occur. Talking to patients and sharing this basic information helps put them at ease and ensures that no part of the process surprises or shocks them. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It also ensures that you have their full consent to proceed. [5] X Research source When you're done, have the patient sit or recline and leave their arm in a dependent position. [6] X Research source Verify the patient’s identity with at least 2 identifiers, such as their name and date of birth. [7] X Research source When patients are nervous, the muscles around their blood vessels may contract in a process called vasoconstriction. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This makes it harder to start an IV, so make sure your patient is as relaxed and comfortable as possible before proceeding. Look at the patient’s medical record or ask them if they’ve had trouble with IV insertion in the past. If so, the patient may be able to tell you which sites are easiest to access, or you can use an ultrasound to help you locate a good vein. [9] X Research source Check if your patient has any allergies or sensitivities. If they have a latex allergy, make sure your tourniquet, gloves, and cannula are latex free. [10] X Research source"

[11] X Research source If necessary, clamp the tubing so that the solution doesn't drip onto the floor. Be sure to remove any bubbles from the tubing by stretching the tubing downward and gently tapping it with your finger. [12] X Research source Then, place a dated and signed sticker on both the IV tubing and the IV bag. [13] X Research source Injecting air bubbles into a patient's bloodstream can cause a serious condition called an embolism. [14] X Research source One easy technique for removing bubbles from the IV tubing is to uncoil the tubing to its full length and run the roller valve all the way up to the drip chamber. Next, puncture the IV bag with the tubing spike and pinch the drip chamber. Open the roller valve and release the line—fluid should flow down the length of the tubing without producing any bubbles.

After the vein is accessed, the catheter is left in place for easy access to the vein. Catheters come in different sizes called gauges. The smaller the gauge number, the thicker the catheter and the more rapidly medicine can be administered and blood can be drawn. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Generally, you'll choose a catheter that's about 14-24 gauge, depending on the patient’s age and health condition.

To avoid the risk of a dangerous infection, it's important to wash your hands and dry them with a clean paper towel before beginning, then put on clean gloves before you handle your equipment and touch the patient. [19] X Research source If your gloves' sterility becomes compromised, take them off and put on a new pair—it's better to be safe than sorry.

      "content": "Look for prominent veins. Next, you'll want to find a site on the patient to administer the IV. For adult patients, the most accessible veins are long, straight ones in upper extremities that aren’t near joints and are furthest from the body. [21] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For children, the most commonly used veins are the cephalic vein in the proximal forearm, the long saphenous vein at or just proximal to the ankle, or the medical aspect of the upper arm. [22] X Research source Look at the patient’s medical record or ask them if they have a history of hard-to-reach veins. [23] X Research source Usually, patients with previous difficult IV experiences will know where their veins are most accessible. Note that, regardless of the presence of veins, there are certain places you won’t want to insert an IV. These include: [24] X Research source Burns, scars, or sclerosed areas In the same location as another recent IV Places where the IV will interfere with surgery Sites that show signs of infection (redness, swelling, irritation, etc.) In a limb on the same side of the body as a mastectomy, fistula, or vascular graft"

[26] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Don't tie the tourniquet too tight—this can prevent the vein from dilating. The tourniquet should be tight enough to block blood flow in the veins but not the arteries. [27] X Research source Letting the limb hang limp towards the floor while a tourniquet is in place can help the veins become more prominent by increasing the blood flow to the limb.

Inserting an IV is a delicate art and experienced doctors and nurses sometimes miss the vein on their first attempt, especially if the patient has difficult-to-hit veins. If you advance the needle and don't see a flashback of blood, explain to the patient that you've missed and are going to try again. [36] X Research source Try to be pleasant to the patient since this process can be painful. You might comfort the patient by explaining why it didn’t work and also saying something like, “Sometimes these things just happen. It’s no one’s fault. We should get it right next time.” If you repeatedly miss the vein, apologize to the patient, remove the needle and catheter, and try again on a different limb with a fresh needle and catheter. Attempting numerous inserts on the same vein can be very painful for the patient and leave lasting scarring. [37] X Research source Do not remove the needle from the skin entirely and then reinsert it. This could result in fragmentation of the catheter and embolism in the patient. Instead, throw away the used needle in a sharps container and reattempt using a fresh needle. [38] X Research source"

Putting loops in the tubing reduces the strain on the IV catheter, making it more comfortable for the patient and less likely to accidentally be removed from the vein.

It's important to know the most common signs of IV complications to provide the patient with the best care and, if needed, to know when to get emergency care. Some IV complications (and their symptoms) include: [54] X Research source Infiltration: Occurs when fluid is injected outside of the vein into surrounding soft tissue. Will cause swelling and smooth, pale skin in the affected area. Can be a minor or serious issue depending on the medicine being administered. Hematoma: Occurs when blood leaks from the vein into the surrounding tissue, usually after more than one vein wall is accidentally punctured. Often accompanied by pain, bruising, and irritation. Will usually resolve within several weeks light pressure. Embolism: Occurs after injecting air into the vein. Often caused by air bubbles in the IV tubing. Children are especially at risk. In serious cases, it causes trouble breathing, chest pain, blue skin, low blood pressure, and even stroke and heart attack. Thrombosis and endarteritis: Life-threatening conditions that can result from injecting into an artery, rather than a vein. Can lead to severe pain, compartment syndrome (high pressure on a muscle leading to a very painful \"tight\" or \"full\" feeling) gangrene, motor dysfunction, and even the eventual loss of the limb."
