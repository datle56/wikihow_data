Get your best outfit together, do your hair, makeup, and nails, and figure out a way to get introduced to him or make him notice you on your own. [1] X Expert Source Alessandra Conti Celebrity Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 23 April 2021. Here are some suggestions: [2] X Research source Accidentally bump into him or just bump shoulders. Perhaps you can pretend that you're rushing somewhere and accidentally bump up against him. When your eyes meet, introduce yourself. Ask a friend to introduce you. Have your friend talk to the guy. Have her play matchmaker, except don't let it be obvious. Go up to him yourself and engage him. Ask him a question about school, or pay him a compliment. Talk about an interest that you may share, or come up to him with a joke."

If he makes a joke, remember to laugh, even if it isn't all that funny; guys like thinking they're funny. Do the little things to send him good body language: [3] X Research source Look into his eyes when you're talking to him and when he's talking to you. Face toward him with your body and keep your posture open and inviting. Twirl your hair if you want him to notice it."

Guys like girls who are pretty, but they also like girls who they can talk to. If they're attracted to you, but you have nothing to say to one another, your relationship isn't going to last very long. [5] X Research source Some keys to having a great conversation: [6] X Research source Ask really good questions. Do this as a way to keep the conversation moving (\"So where did you live before you moved here?\") and as a way of letting him know that you're actively listening (\"You said you didn't like action movies. What kind of movies are even left for a guy to like?\"). [7] X Research source Offer him information about yourself. He's probably interested in you, too, so don't spend the whole time asking him questions without volunteering information yourself. Make light of a painfully awkward situation by calling attention to it humorously. If you find yourself in a really awkward situation, say so! \"Sorry that was awkward, I'm the queen of that\" is a funny way of defusing the situation."

If you're trying to make a point, tap him on the hand. If you're trying to console him (perhaps as a joke), give him a reassuring back-pat. If he's very playful, you might even tickle him and get good results. [8] X Research source"

You can pretty much flirt in three different ways: Via text or the internet: Send him a text saying something like: \"Hey! I really enjoyed having that talk last week. Hope it can happen again soon....\" Or send him a text in a more joking style: \"Since when do you look like a cave monster in the morning?? :-) You look like you didn't get any sleep!\" Via body language: [10] X Research source Twirling your hair, batting your lashes subtly, and giggling sweetly. Rubbing his chest or thighs, which is very suggestive; use sparingly. Via compliments: Try something like: \"So how often do girls attach themselves to you like magnets when you step outside?\" Or maybe something like: \"You're really fun to talk to. Why is it that a special guy like you doesn't have a girlfriend?\""

Keep a good balance between casual and formal, bombshell and girl-next-door, absolutely stunning and subtly sexy. Don't be afraid to take chances with your style, but above all, be sure that what you're wearing is the best possible outfit. [12] X Research source If you feel like getting that extra top or those one pair of jeans will set you over the top, go for it. It's okay to reward yourself, especially if it makes you feel good. If you have a sense of what type of girl he likes, try to dress the part. Don't be anyone you're not, but try to incorporate elements of that style into your wardrobe."

If you can't take a shower for whatever reason, give the smelly parts of your body, especially your underarms, a mini bath by lathering up with soap and rinsing with a bit of water. [13] X Research source Make sure your hair isn't greasy. Greasy hair, for the most part, is not attractive. If you have very oily skin, you may need to shampoo your hair every two days (or every day if it's really bad)."

There aren't any big changes that you can make in 10 days, but definitely focus on: Eliminating pimples and acne . If you have breakouts, wash your face twice a day, moisturize after each wash, eat healthy, and use acne-busting products. [14] X Research source Use minimal makeup to cover up blemishes or imperfections. Guys like girls with natural looks, so don't cake the makeup on. Use it sparingly but effectively. Get your facial hair under control, if necessary. If your eyebrows are shaggy, consider getting them sculpted. If you have visible hair on your lip, consider removing it . [15] X Research source Make your lips look luscious and kissable. A small amount of lip balm and lip gloss could send your lips into unstoppable kissable territory."

What's important is that you're treating your body with love and giving it what it needs. Try any combination of the following if you feel like you want to get back in shape. [17] X Expert Source Alessandra Conti Celebrity Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 23 April 2021. Join an intramural sports team/league. If you love playing soccer, try to join a league. If basketball is good fit, get together with another group of basketball lovers. Join any team that makes you want to exercise. Consider joining a gym or using gym equipment. Joining a gym will let you take advantage of lots of different equipment, all under one roof. Use the gym to do cardio exercises like running (treadmill, incline), swimming, and cycling (spinning). [18] X Research source If nothing else, try to walk for 30 minutes every day. Walking for 30 minutes every day gives your body a small, but important, bit of exercise. If you can't join a sports team or gym, and don't want to do cardio, then walking will help you exercise. [19] X Research source"

You want to nudge him in the right direction if he hasn't already asked you on a date. You can do this in a variety of ways: [21] X Research source Be really bold and up-front: \"Why is it that you haven't asked me on a date yet?\" If he likes you, he'll ask you right away. Be sly: \"My friend and I were going to go to the movies tomorrow night, but she cancelled and now I don't know what to do.\" He could suggest that you two do something instead."

You don't need to do this, but if you want to get a guy in 10 days, you need to be more forward than normal. This is popular for two reasons: Sometimes the guy likes you but doesn't really know how to show his feeling or ask you out on a date. If he knows that you like him back, it could give him the courage to actually ask out because he's not afraid of being rejected. If the guy doesn't like you, after this, you'll know. You can look 50 shades of beautiful and still not convince a guy to like you. That's just the way life is sometimes. If your friend tells him that you like him and he doesn't act, what's the use of going after him? There could be very little that you can do to get him to like you short of forcing him to be your boyfriend, and you don't want that."

Whether you go to the movies, a bowling alley, an art museum, or a walk in the park, try to balance out two ideas: Show him that you like him, but still make him do some work. Guys like encouragement, so give him nice smiles, thank him for paying if he does, and get close to him. At the same time, guys like a little bit of a chase, so don't throw yourself onto him just quite yet. Be friendly without being totally head over heels just quite yet."

(Always bring breath mints, they're a lifesaver!) If he hasn't tried to kiss you, you need to give him better signals that he should kiss you: [22] X Research source Get closer to him than you usually do. Let your face get closer to his face so that he doesn't have to move as far to kiss you. Look at him longingly in his eyes. Fix his eyes with yours. Lick your lips seductively. This is really easy to overdo, so don't do it very often. Once is plenty!"

Love should come easy from now on, if you let it. Remember, though, that guys are a different breed from girls, and that what he wants might not be the same as what you want. He might not want to rush into a relationship. He might want to casually date before committing to you. He might not be as communicative as you are. He probably won't be as expressive with his feelings as you are with yours. He might act macho in front of his friends. He's just trying to impress you. He might not understand the idea of romance. He might need to be pushed and nudged and told how to be romantic."
