      "title": "Use volumizing shampoo.",
      "content": "Use volumizing shampoo. People with thin hair get the most benefits from shampooing daily. This helps to break up any oils and spread them out so that the hair at the scalp looks less limp. Shampooing can also hydrate your scalp. To keep your hair healthy, use a sulfate-free shampoo that is advertised as volumizing or oil reducing. Towel drying your hair can increase volume around your part, making it easy to hide your scalp."

      "title": "Apply hair fibers to your part.",
      "content": "Apply hair fibers to your part. These are very small, colored, plastic-based fibers that attach directly to your hair and scalp. Some fibers require that you use a bonding solution, whereas others stick instantly where they are scattered. Placing these fibers around your part can create the illusion of a hidden scalp. [2] X Research source Choose a fiber that is very close to your hair color. Many hair care companies, like Keranique, offer a wide array of color options. Hair fibers will usually stay in place when exposed to wind or rain. However, they will fall out when you wash your hair. This is why many people with hair fibers will only shampoo their hair once a week. The downside is that this can lead to oily hair. You can find hair fibers online or at your local beauty supply store."

You can use it to make the width of your part less noticeable or to fill in any bare patches of hair. [3] X Research source One of the great things about hair powder is that it is generally sweat resistant. But, it’s still a good idea to keep an eye on it and reapply if necessary. To apply the product without it caking, keep the spray or bottle at least six inches away from your scalp."

[6] X Research source For example, you might say, “I’ve noticed my part seems a lot wider lately. Is there some way to make it appear smaller?” Your stylist could lower the possibility of damage by using products specifically designed for thin or thinning hair, for example."

[10] X Research source A downside can be that scalp micropigmentation works best on people with not only thin, but short, hair. Otherwise, multiple treatments may be required and can still only create mixed results."

[15] X Research source If you are worried about scalp visibility, choose a hair or highlight color that is close to your natural shade. This will make any future root growth less obvious. There are also root touch-up sticks that work well for a quick, on-the-go fix."
