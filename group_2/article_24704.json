      "content": "Garbage cans with built-in diaper lids help block smelly odors. Diaper pails are all the rage these days because, with each toss, the pail automatically seals out the stink. This handy tool can reduce the number of times you have to take out the nursery trash, helping your baby’s space stay fresh for longer. The Ubbi Steel Diaper Pail and Munchkin Step are deemed the best and most cost-effective diaper pails on the market. [1] X Research source Consider using a diaper pail deodorizer inside your pail to deodorize odors while the lid’s closed."

      "content": "Dirty diaper smells get stronger the longer they sit, so toss them out. Rather than setting a dirty diaper aside to throw away later, throw it in a lidded trash can right away. Better yet, toss the soiled package in an outdoor trash can to keep the stink as far from the house as possible. [2] X Research source Set a trash can or diaper pail near the changing table to make clean-up that much easier. Use odor-blocking trash bags for extra stink protection. [3] X Research source Wrap the diaper in a plastic grocery bag or dog poop bag before throwing it away to lock in odor."

This will help the room stay fresh, and soon it’ll become a normal part of your routine. Add some more chores, like vacuuming or picking up toys, to the evening trash run to keep the baby’s room fresh and clean every day."

      "content": "Take the baby into another room if smells start to linger. If your baby’s nursery doesn’t have good airflow or an openable window, try changing their diapers in a space that does. Maybe that’s the living room, dining room, or outdoor space like the patio. Clean and disinfect any area you use to change a baby, wiping down all surfaces and tossing blankets in the wash."

      "content": "Odors can linger on surfaces used to change a baby, so always disinfect. Once your baby is clean and off the changing table, wipe the area with a baby wipe or damp paper towel. [4] X Research source Then, use a bleach- or alcohol-based disinfectant spray or wipe to kill any lingering bacteria and smells. Commercial disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are safe to use on changing tables as long as the proper drying time and ventilation are applied based on the disinfectant’s instructions.

If you can’t open a window, turn on a ceiling fan (if the nursery has one) to improve airflow.

Place them in drawers, under the changing table mattress, or at the bottom of a trash can. Their fresh scent will be faint but constant. [7] X Research source Replace the dryer sheets in drawers every other week and in trash cans when you take out the trash."

      "content": "Clean up any baby messes that can leave a nursery smelling funky. Believe it or not, many funky odors come from the crib. Look over all the blankets and sheets in the nursery for drool, spit-up, and diaper leak stains (that means your cuddling blankets too). If you find any, toss the bedding in the wash and switch it out for something clean and fresh. Try washing or changing crib sheets once a week. Keep a pair of spare sheets in the nursery closet for clean-up emergencies. Ensure that the crib sheets are snug and tight around the mattress to avoid entanglement. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source If odors continue to linger even after you dispose of dirty diapers, try placing a DIY baking soda air freshener at the bottom of your trash can or diaper pail. Cut off the bottom of a plastic bottle and add 2 tbsp (28.3 g) to the makeshift dish. Then, add 2 to 3 drops of your favorite essential oil and set it down in your trash can before adding a bag. [10] X Research source If you don’t have essential oils, no worries! The air freshener will still absorb odors without them. [11] X Research source"

Follow these tips to safely use essential oils around your baby: Talk to your pediatrician before using essential oils around a baby. Buy oils from credible companies that list the scientific names of the oils. [13] X Research source Introduce your baby to essential oils slowly by wearing them on your skin. Add less oil to a diffuser to not overwhelm a baby with a scent. Set the diffuser to run for 10-minute spurts when the baby is in the room or on a constant cycle when the baby isn’t in the room.

      "content": "Keep used bottles out of the nursery as spoiled milk can stink. If you feed a baby in their nursery, make sure to take the bottle with you on the way out. This way, you won’t walk into a sour or rancid smell later. Breast milk can naturally have an odd odor, especially after it’s been refrigerated or frozen. Infant formula can spoil if it’s left out for more than 2 hours, and it’s advised to throw out any formula left in the bottle after feeding, as bacteria can quickly grow from saliva and formula mixing.
