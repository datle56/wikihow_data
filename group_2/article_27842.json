      "content": "Understand the limitations. The \"Continue where you left off\" feature tells Chrome to reopen all open tabs, including pinned tabs, each time you close and restart Chrome. However, pinned tabs can be lost if you're using multiple Chrome windows. Here's why: With this feature, Chrome reopens the tabs from the Chrome window you closed last , whether pinned or not pinned. Only the tabs from the last Chrome window you closed will reopen the next time you launch Chrome. If you're using multiple Chrome windows and close the window that has pinned tabs before closing another window, Chrome will lose your pinned tabs. Because it's easy to accidentally close open windows in the wrong order, we'll show you how to bookmark your pinned tabs so you can easily bring them back if lost."
