      "title": "Fill a bucket halfway with water.",
      "content": "Fill a bucket halfway with water. Choose an old bucket and use a hose to fill it with water. If the bucket is very large, only fill it a quarter of the way, as you will need to be able to move the bucket. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a bucket at home, recycle an old plastic container instead."

      "title": "Add 4 drops of liquid soap to the water.",
      "content": "Add 4 drops of liquid soap to the water. Mosquitoes are attracted to stagnant water, as this is where they lay their eggs. The detergent will remove the surface tension of the water and cause the mosquitoes to drown when they land on the water. [2] X Expert Source Chikezie Onyianta Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 1 April 2021. Gently squeeze the drops into the middle of the bucket. [3] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Any liquid washing detergent, such as dish soap, will work for this trap."

    {
      "title": "Stir the water gently with your hand.",
      "content": "Stir the water gently with your hand. Avoid stirring the water vigorously, as this can cause lots of bubbles in the water. Stir the mixture for about 10 seconds, or until the detergent is distributed across the top of the water. [4] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Your mosquito trap is now ready to catch pesky mosquitoes."

    {
      "title": "Place the bucket under a light to attract more mosquitoes.",
      "content": "Place the bucket under a light to attract more mosquitoes. If you find that your trap is not catching many mosquitoes, move it to a well-lit area, such as under an outside light. This helps to attract the mosquitoes to the water. [5] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source If you don’t have an outside light, set up a solar light next to the trap. Avoid using electricity near the trap, as this can be dangerous."

      "title": "Cut off the spout of an empty 2 litre soda bottle.",
      "content": "Cut off the spout of an empty 2 litre soda bottle. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut around the bottle, just above the label or where the bottle starts to curve toward the lid. Keep the spout, as you will need to use this later. [6] X Research source If you’re having trouble cutting the bottle with scissors, use a craft knife instead."

      "title": "Mix 1 cup (200 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (250 mL) of hot water into the bottle.",
      "content": "Mix 1 cup (200 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (250 mL) of hot water into the bottle. Measure the sugar and hot water into the bottle. Stir the mixture with a spoon until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. [7] X Research source Run the kitchen tap until the water is hot. Don’t use boiling water, as this can damage the yeast. Both white sugar and raw sugar will work for this trap."

      "title": "Stir in 1 tsp (3.5 grams) of active dry yeast.",
      "content": "Stir in 1 tsp (3.5 grams) of active dry yeast. Measure the yeast into the sugar and water solution. Use a spoon to stir the mixture until it is frothy. This normally takes about 30 seconds. The yeast feeds off the sugar and releases carbon dioxide which attracts mosquitoes. [8] X Research source Purchase active dry yeast from the baking section of a grocery store."

      "content": "Mix in 1 cup (250 mL) of room-temperature water. Measure tap water into the mosquito trap. Stir the mixture until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. [9] X Research source If your tap water is hot, leave the water to cool at room temperature for 15 minutes."

      "title": "Cover the bottle and then keep it in a warm place for 1 week.",
      "content": "Cover the bottle and then keep it in a warm place for 1 week. This gives time for the yeast to ferment. Place plastic wrap over the container but don’t secure it in place, as the mixture needs to be able to breathe. Store the bottle in a warm, dry, and humid place. [10] X Research source A hot water heater closet and a loft are ideal storage locations"

    {
      "title": "Place the spout upside down inside the bottle to create a funnel.",
      "content": "Place the spout upside down inside the bottle to create a funnel. This confuses the mosquitoes and causes them to get trapped in the bottle. Take the sprout that you cut off the bottle and insert it into the bottle upside down. Line the cut edges of the bottle up so that they are at the same height. [11] X Research source Leave the bottle lid off the spout."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the spout in place with tape.",
      "content": "Secure the spout in place with tape. Use heavy-duty tape (like duct tape) to connect both pieces of the bottle. Cover the entire rim to ensure that the spout and bottle are securely joined. [12] X Research source Heavy-duty tape works well for this trap."

    {
      "title": "Place the trap in an area that has lots of mosquitoes.",
      "content": "Place the trap in an area that has lots of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are often attracted to light and water. Consider placing the trap beside a pool or by an outdoor light. Experiment with different locations until you find a spot that works well. [13] X Research source Place the trap in a spot that won’t be knocked over by pets."

      "content": "Drape mosquito netting over the back of a metal box fan. Choose a piece of mosquito netting that is a similar size to the back screen of the box fan. If the net is too big, trim the net down to size with a pair of sharp scissors. [14] X Research source Purchase mosquito netting and a metal box fan from a hardware store."

    {
      "title": "Place 1 strong magnet on each corner of the back screen to secure the netting.",
      "content": "Place 1 strong magnet on each corner of the back screen to secure the netting. The magnets will latch onto the metal screen and keep the netting securely in place. Use magnets that are marketed as “powerful” or “super strong”. Use extra magnets if the netting comes loose."

      "content": "Mix water and 70% isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle at a 1:1 ratio. For example, measure 1 cup (240 mL) of water and 1 cup (240 mL) of isopropyl alcohol into the spray bottle. Shake the bottle vigorously for 10 seconds to combine the liquids. [15] X Research source Purchase isopropyl alcohol from a hardware store."

      "title": "Turn on the fan and wait for the mosquitoes to get caught in the trap.",
      "content": "Turn on the fan and wait for the mosquitoes to get caught in the trap. The strong air movement will pull any lingering mosquitoes into the meshing. Set the fan to the highest setting to achieve the best results. [16] X Research source Place the fan in an area where there are lots of mosquitoes, such as by an outdoor light."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the fan off and spray the alcohol solution over the netting.",
      "content": "Turn the fan off and spray the alcohol solution over the netting. The alcohol and water solutions poisons the mosquitoes that are trapped in the netting. Liberally spray the netting with water until the fabric is soaked. Insects will eat the dead mosquitoes overnight, leaving you with clean mesh."
