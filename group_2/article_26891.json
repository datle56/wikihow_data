      "title": "Gather your ingredients.",
      "content": "Gather your ingredients. The great thing about this recipe is that it doesn’t require any strange or hard to find ingredients. Head to your local supermarket to grab mayonnaise, ketchup, horseradish sauce, sugar, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. You may even have these things in your cabinet and refrigerator already! If you want to make a lighter or lower calorie version, you can use low fat mayonnaise and reduced sugar ketchup."

      "title": "Choose your container.",
      "content": "Choose your container. This recipe makes about 4 to 8 servings of Zesty Sauce, so depending on the occasion, you may use it all up in one sitting. If that’s the case, feel free to just use a small bowl. If you plan on storing your Zesty Sauce, it’s helpful to make it in a container that has a lid. If you have an empty condiment bottle, it’s a great idea to clean it out and use that for your sauce."
    },
    {
      "title": "Combine your ingredients.",
      "content": "Combine your ingredients. Squeeze the mayonnaise, ketchup and horseradish sauce into your measuring cup or spoons and then dump them in the bowl (or condiment bottle, if that's what you're using). Add the sugar, lemon juice and pepper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the ingredients.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients. You can use almost any sort of utensil to stir your sauce, but a rubber spatula will help ensure you get all of the ingredients blended thoroughly. Continuously scrape the ingredients from the sides of the bowl and fold them back into the sauce. If you poured your ingredients directly into a condiment bottle, shake it vigorously. This is much easier than trying to stir it. After about 30 seconds, it should be blended."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your sauce a taste test.",
      "content": "Give your sauce a taste test. Lick the back of your spatula, or dip your finger into the sauce. If you think your mixture needs any changes, add whatever ingredient you think it needs. Then mix again and taste again, until your sauce is to your satisfaction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chill your Zesty Sauce.",
      "content": "Chill your Zesty Sauce. Place the bowl or container in the refrigerator for about an hour before serving. The flavors will meld and improve during this time. If you are crunched for time or simply want to use the sauce immediately, it’s perfectly OK to eat it at room temperature."
