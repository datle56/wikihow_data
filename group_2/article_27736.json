Use a stretch stitch, if possible. You can also use a straight stitch and pull on the fabric as you are sewing it. This will allow the thread to stretch while you are wearing the shirt. [4] X Research source Another option is to sew the hem with a zigzag stitch instead. A stretch stitch is a special stitch used for stretchy fabrics. Not all sewing machines have this."
