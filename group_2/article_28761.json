Cut identically spaced 1/4\" holes into both ends of the 1x4 boards. Drill 1/4\" holes half-way into the 37\" posts, 15 1/3\" from the bottom, then 14 1/6\" from the bottom. Glue and then insert dowels into the holes. Then you can fit all of the pieces together to form the two sides of the chair. The side pieces should be flush with the tops of the short posts. Slide the split 1x4s 4\" up from the bottom on either side piece and screw them into place with decking screws."

Then cut 1.5\"x1.5\" notches out of two of the corners of the board, to make room for the back posts. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes into one of the 1x4s at the edge on one of the long sides (one hole centered and the other two 4 1/3\" from each end of the board). Line up this piece with the seat piece on the side that has the notches. Mark the locations of the dowel holes from the 1x4 onto the seat piece between the two notches. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes there as well. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes, centered, into each of your 3 pieces created from the 1x4. Drill centered pilot holes in your posts for your decking screws 1 3/4\" from the top of the short posts and 14 3/4 from the bottom of your tall posts."

Check that your line is perfectly perpendicular using math or a protractor. Hand draw a soft curve from the 30\" point to one end of the 20\" line.
