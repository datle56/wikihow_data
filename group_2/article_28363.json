      "content": "Warm up. Warm your muscles up with some brief cardio like running, jumping rope, or doing jumping jacks. [1] X Research source It’s important to warm up your muscles before stretching to avoid strain and potential injury. You'll get more of a stretch if you warm up prior, because the added blood flow to the muscles will help them naturally loosen up a bit."

[2] X Research source Sit upright on the ground with your legs held straight in front of you. Slowly bend forward at the waist, keeping your back straight. Extend your hands and reach for your toes. If you can’t reach your toes, try touching your ankles or perhaps your knees. Move your extended legs out so that they’re about shoulder width distance apart. Repeat bending forward and reaching for your toes (or ankles or knees). [3] X Research source"

Hold for several seconds. Drop your stomach, lift your head, and pull your back downward into an inverted arch. [5] X Research source For the next stretch, lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the ground. Keeping your back on the ground and your legs bent, slowly lower your knees to the ground on your right. Move your legs back into a neutral position. Repeat the stretch on the left side.

      "content": "Begin on your hands and knees. From that position, place one forearm flat on the ground. Adjust the position of the other hand by moving it back until the heel of your hand is directly across from where the elbow of your opposite arm is resting. Touching your feet to your head from a handstand position is a very advanced technique that you should only attempt if you have advanced levels of strength, flexibility, and balance. [10] X Research source Alternatively, a less demanding strategy is to start on your hands and knees close to and facing a wall, then lower yourself onto both forearms."

Alternatively, you can use a wall as a brace while you slowly lower your feet towards your head.
