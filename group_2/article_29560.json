      "title": "Use an 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) sheet of printer paper.",
      "content": "Use an 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) sheet of printer paper. If you don't have printer paper handy, you can also tear a piece of paper out of your notebook. A standard piece of A4 printer paper, 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) in size works best, but you can use larger or smaller paper if you wish. Just make sure you are using rectangular paper. Notebook paper will not be as sturdy as printer paper and won't make as loud of a noise, but still works well. The paper doesn't have to be this exact size, but it's a good size to start with as it is easier to fold. Lay the paper flat so the longer sides are on the top and bottom."

      "title": "Fold the bottom fourth of your paper up.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom fourth of your paper up. Fold about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) of the paper up on a horizontal fold and then apply a crease. [1] X Research source Fold the paper away from you, toward the top. Run your finger along the bottom edge to create the crease and keep the fold in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold another 2.5 inches (64 mm) of the paper up.",
      "content": "Fold another 2.5 inches (64 mm) of the paper up. When you're finished, you should have 1 inch (25 mm) of unfolded paper remaining. [2] X Research source If you have a little more or less than 1 inch (2.5 cm), that's okay too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip your paper over and fold it in half.",
      "content": "Flip your paper over and fold it in half. You want to flip your paper so that the unfolded portion is now on the bottom, closest to you. Then fold the paper in half on a vertical crease. When you make this fold, the folded part, or bar, should be visible again. You will now have a square shape with your folds on the outside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab the popper at the back tip of the folded bar on the top of your paper.",
      "content": "Grab the popper at the back tip of the folded bar on the top of your paper. Find the folded edge of your top bar (the part of the paper you folded up earlier) and pinch it with one hand. Then grab the bottom corner with your other hand. Pull the bar up and out as you push the unfolded portion of paper in and down in the opposite direction. [3] X Research source You will now see that you’ve created two open loops, or pockets, from the folded bar. Pinch the bottom corners of your looped paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure you’re not pinching any of the unfolded portions of the paper.",
      "content": "Make sure you’re not pinching any of the unfolded portions of the paper. You shouldn't pinch the paper too hard. Don't hold down the unfolded part in the middle, or you won't be able to snap it. You can think of this as a bit like holding a paper airplane upside-down. Look through the outside of the popper inward. You should have created two almost diamond-shaped air pockets. When you're snapping the popper open, you'll be releasing the unfolded section of paper. Make sure you're not holding the bottom edge of the unfolded paper and that it has freedom to move. For extra noise, you can try to stretch out and open the air pockets a bit to take in as much air as possible."

    {
      "title": "Snap the popper down.",
      "content": "Snap the popper down. Raise your arm and then bring it down like you're cracking a whip or bouncing a ball. [4] X Research source The air pockets should whip out, creating a cracking sound. You can snap the paper down on a desk, or just snap it in the air. As you bring your arm down, snap your wrist down as well to give it extra force."

      "content": "Get a piece of 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) printer paper. To make this popper will need a sheet of rectangular paper. Any standard 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) sheet of paper works well. [5] X Research source A standard piece of A4 printer paper, 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm) in size works best, but you can use larger or smaller paper if you wish. Just make sure you are using rectangular paper. You can also use notebook paper. Notebook paper won’t be quite as loud because it’s not as heavy, but will still work fine. Place your paper on a table so that the longer sides are on the top and bottom."

      "content": "Create creases on the paper to use as guides. Fold the paper in half lengthwise on a horizontal crease then unfold it. Now fold it in half widthwise on a vertical crease and unfold it again. [6] X Research source At this point, you should have four creases in your paper, both vertically and horizontally. The creases will look like a cross."

      "title": "Fold each corner of the paper inward.",
      "content": "Fold each corner of the paper inward. The edge of your folds should line up with the horizontal crease. [7] X Research source When you are done with these four folds, there should be two triangles on either side of the paper. Think of folding each corner down like you would for a paper airplane. You will have a vertical, open section of unfolded paper in the middle between your folds."

      "title": "Fold up the left and right corners.",
      "content": "Fold up the left and right corners. Position your paper so that the longer flat edge is facing down closer to you. Take the bottom two corners on the left and right side and fold upward. [9] X Research source Make sure to line the edges up with the vertical crease. This should create two triangular flaps which meet in the center and together make a diamond."

      "title": "Pop your paper popper.",
      "content": "Pop your paper popper. Hold the bottom corners of the popper between your thumb and index finger. Raise your arm above your head, and quickly snap it down to create the popping sound. [11] X Research source You may need to pull the inner folds of your paper out a little to get the paper to pop the first time if your paper is stiff. Tuck back in the flap that comes out to make the noise again."

You will now see two loops, or cone shapes, which were created by pushing the inner flaps upward. Keep the inner flaps held in place by pinching the outer flaps toward the middle the paper. Make sure you're not pinching any parts of the inner flaps as the cones you’ve created will flap out when you throw down your popper and make the noise."
