      "content": "Don’t talk about your previous boss or company. Even if you think the way you were let go was unfair or terrible, don’t badmouth your former employer or boss in an interview. This makes you look negative and often changes the way the interviewer sees you. [2] X Research source If the interviewer asks you to elaborate about your boss or former company, you can say something like, \"The company just wasn't a good fit for me, because it didn't present the types of challenges I most enjoy.\" [3] X Expert Source Melody Godfred, JD Career Coach Expert Interview. 29 April 2020.

      "content": "Avoid saying “fired.” Don’t lie, but you don’t have to be obvious about it either. Instead, you can say things like “my company downsized” or “my position was eliminated.” [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Be concise, then move on.",
      "content": "Be concise, then move on. If it’s apparent to the interviewer that you were fired for a more specific reason that downsizing, explain what happened in as few words as possible. [5] X Research source For example, you can say something like “I learned that I should really research the companies I apply to, to make sure that their goals and mine match. For example, I noticed that your company’s commitment to social justice matches my own passion for it, which is exemplified by my work with the ACLU.”"

[6] X Expert Source Melody Godfred, JD Career Coach Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. This doesn’t necessarily mean accepting blame if you weren’t at fault, but it can mean acknowledging the position wasn’t a good fit or you didn’t get along with your bosses or coworkers. [7] X Research source For example, you can say something like “You can see on my resume that being involuntarily let go from a position is not commonplace for me. The truth is that my boss and I did not get along well and the position wasn’t a good fit. I’ve learned a lot from the position, and my references will attest to my excellence as an employee and coworker.”"

      "content": "Update your resume. Even if you were fired, you probably picked up new skills and experiences at your old job.

[8] X Expert Source Melody Godfred, JD Career Coach Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. After you’ve spent some time reflecting on what you want your next opportunity to look like, ask your network for help finding it. [9] X Research source For example, you can send a short email that says “Hi Steve, I’m looking for my next career opportunity, and I’m interested in moving more into sales than marketing. I was hoping you could point me in the right direction since you have so much sales experience!”"

You can say something like “Dear Kim, I’m applying for a new position with XYZ Management, and given our work history together, I was hoping you’d be willing to write a reference for me.” Make sure you include where the reference letter should go, who it should be addressed to, and when it’s due."
