      "content": "Place a 10 in (25 cm) plate onto a piece of felt or fabric fleece. Lay out your fleece fabric so that it is flat with no lumps or bumps. Then, place a 10 in (25 cm) plate so that it is completely on the fabric. Trace around the outside of the plate with a pencil to create a circle on the fabric. [1] X Research source If you cannot see the circle, you may need to go over it with the pencil again or use chalk. Avoid using a pen to trace the circle since this will not come off as easily."

      "title": "Cut out the circle you traced onto the fabric.",
      "content": "Cut out the circle you traced onto the fabric. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the line you traced onto your fabric. Go slowly and make even cuts to ensure that there are no jagged edges around the top of the pouch. [2] X Research source If you have a rotary cutter and cutting mat, you may use that to cut along the line instead. Apply firm, even pressure to the cutter to ensure that you do not have to go over the same spot twice. [3] X Research source"

Then, place an 8 in (20 cm) plate at the center of this circle. Make sure that its edges are equidistant to the edges of the fabric. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Mark the fabric with 0.5 in (1.3 cm) lines at 12 points around the plate. Imagine the plate is a clock. Then, use a pencil and ruler to create a pair of 0.5 in (1.3 cm) long lines at the 12:00 position on the edge of the plate. Position the marks so they are about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) apart and about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edge of the fabric. [5] X Research source Repeat this for each hour position going all the way around the plate. For example, make 2 marks at 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, and so on going all the way around."

Make sure that you only cut the line and do not cut past it in either direction. Cutting through each line will create a notch in the fabric that you can insert the cord through. [6] X Research source You may need to use a smaller pair of scissors to cut these notches."

Insert 1 end of the cord through 1 of the notches you made, then bring it through the notch right next to it coming through the other side of the fabric. Then, bring the cord through the next notch on the same side as you brought it through the first, and back through that notch's pair on the other side again. [7] X Research source Repeat this until you have woven the cord through all of the notches 1 time and you are back at the beginning."

Fold your fabric in half and measure up from the fold to find the location 6 in (15 cm) from the fold. Mark the fabric at this point with a pencil. Then, measure across the fabric at this point to find the location 6 by 6 in (15 by 15 cm) from the raw edge. Cut the fabric using these marks to guide you.

Fold the top edges over so that the raw edges are going inwards towards the wrong (back or inner) side of the fabric.

This will create a tube in the fabric through which you can insert a cord. [11] X Research source Repeat this for both of the folded and pinned edges.

Tie the ends together to secure them. [16] X Research source Your pouch is now complete! Tug on the knotted ends of the cords to close the bag, and use your fingers to spread apart the fabric to open the bag back up."
