So long as you have a big enough mold box to place the item in, it can be recreated. Once you select your item, clean it thoroughly with warm, soapy water to limit any dirt affecting the mold’s quality. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Grab a non-porous container to house the casting. This will be your mold box. You can use take-out plastic containers, Tupperware, or a cookie cutter. Ensure the mold is big enough for your item but not large enough that you’ll waste silicone rubber. Place a piece of parchment paper on a flat surface and tape or glue the mold box in place. This will help prevent the container from moving around as you fill the mold and avoid silicone from going beneath the item. Lightly spray mold release on the container before pouring in your silicone rubber to make it easier to remove the mold later. Allow the mold release to dry for about 10 minutes. A non-porous surface is important so the silicone doesn’t leak. This includes any plastic, glass, metal, ceramic, or vinyl surfaces. [2] X Research source"

Follow the instructions on the packaging. However, many brands use a 1:1 ratio of Part A and B that sets clear in two hours. Ensure you’re mixing the silicone rubber in a well-ventilated area. [3] X Research source Mix the solution in a non-porous container, like a bowl or a Tupperware."

However, you can make it deeper. This will just leave you with a thicker mold. Keep a steady stream of silicone in one place to eliminate trapped bubbles. [4] X Research source Use a toothpick to poke any bubbles that may appear or smooth it out with a silicone spatula."

Once the mold has cured and dried, carefully remove the mold box and the item inside. Now you’re ready to cast! [5] X Research source Silicone molds can be reused many times with the proper care. Wash it after using it with mild dish soap and store it in cool and dry places. Silicone molds are the most recommended material for resin-making since resin is a hard material and silicone offers plenty of flexibility for removal."

Typically, these kits are pre-measured, so all you’ll need to do is combine Part A and Part B. [6] X Research source This differs from silicone rubber, as this formula creates a clay or putty consistency rather than liquid. Putty-like molds may add texture to your finished piece. To avoid this, use a spray mold release to smooth the resin surface."

This will keep the item in place temporarily. Fill any gaps in the base with additional hot glue or clay. [10] X Research source If the item you selected for your mold doesn’t have a flat base, use clay to create a flat slab beneath the item."

Brush the latex in thin layers, ensuring no puddles or thick areas. Allow each layer to dry for 15 minutes to 2 hours before applying another coat. [11] X Research source Latex is a thin material, so apply at least 20 layers to create a durable mold. However, each layer needs to be completely dry before applying another. You can speed up the drying process by using a hair dryer. If you notice any air bubbles in your mold, use a compressed air can to get rid of them. Each coat should be completed within 24 hours to ensure each layer sticks to each other."

[17] X Research source As long as you’re using quality materials, polyurethane rubber molds can be reused many times and last for years. Use a mix of dish soap, vinegar, and water to clean them and store them in a cool, dry place. This mold type offers limited flexibility compared to silicone.

You only need a pencil, paper, and imagination (or a reference picture). Sketch your design onto a piece of paper, cut it out, and transfer it to a foam board. [18] X Research source A foam board will give the hot glue the stability it needs and provide enough layers not to burn or melt through.

Be sure to have plenty of hot glue sticks before starting this project, as the amount you’ll need will depend solely on how large your design is. Trace the outline slowly with a hot glue gun, ensuring there are no possible openings for resin to slip out of. Let it harden before using. [20] X Research source Repeat this process two or three times to create a “wall” for the resin inside. If there’s a leak in your mold, don’t panic! Add more hot glue to the outside of the mold to fill the gap. If you have a small item, like a charm or a small seashell, you can coat it with oil and pour hot glue. The oil will prevent the item from sticking to the glue. Wait for it to dry before removing it. Hot glue molds can be reused. However, they can be delicate and prone to breaking. Handle it carefully and clean it with mild dish soap and cold or warm water. This mold type is the best for free-hand molds since you don’t need to rely on an original item to make it. They’re inexpensive, reusable, and won’t stick to your project."
