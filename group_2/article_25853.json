      "title": "Confident.",
      "content": "Confident. If your moon falls into Leo, you likely feel deep sense of internal power and self-awareness. In a way, you know your inner self better than any other sign—while a Leo sun or rising might project confidence in more showy, obvious ways, your confidence is steady, value-based, and totally magnetic to others. As a Leo moon, you might be cool in difficult moments and under pressure. If the group gets lost on the way home, take the reins—you can handle it! Leo moons usually thrive in leadership. To feel connected to your moon sign, try spearheading a project or planning your friend’s surprise party. [1] X Research source Your Leo moon might also help you handle rejection and failure well.

      "title": "Charming.",
      "content": "Charming. As a Leo moon, people feel like they’ve known you a long time, even if you've just met them. Your charisma is more understated than a Leo sun or rising—instead, your warm, reassuring, and generous in conversation. At parties, you might make a quiet entrance, and then throughout the night, notice more and more people flocking to your intoxicating inner light. When you leave the party, you’re the friend who gets rave reviews from new people (“Who was that Sarah girl? She was so fun to talk to…”). You may not dominate the conversation at dinner, but you’re the one who lands the best one-liner of the night."

      "title": "Theatrical.",
      "content": "Theatrical. Leo moons may not be as loud or flamboyant as your standard Leo sun, but still, they’re exciting and dramatic at heart. You might not grab the mic in karaoke, but you love adding a little sparkle to the stories you tell friends. Deep down, you believe that life is more fun with an audience. And even though it’s not the most dominant part of your personality, anyone who knows you well knows you’re a star at heart.

      "content": "Creative. Leo moons have creative hearts; you might not have dedicated your life to the arts, but deep down, you’re a true artist. Expression, to you, comes naturally—whether it’s painting, music, fashion, or drama, you need to have your outlet. For you, pumping those creative juices isn’t a struggle, or even work. It comes naturally to you, flowing from the deepest facet of your chart, your moon. [3] X Research source Leo moon, you don’t necessarily need an audience to flex your creative muscles. Try casually journaling , doodling, or dancing around your room. Maybe you don’t feel like an artist, but a Leo moon's creative outlet might be subtle. Do you love telling great stories? Do you dress with purpose every day?"

      "content": "Self-indulgent. Leo moons know how great they are—and as much as this is a strength, it might be a challenge at times, too. Though Leo moons are super loyal and generous souls, they might get a little too focused on their own feelings, desires, and need for an audience. In relationships, Leo moons should remember not to let their own feelings eclipse other peoples'. Leo moon, you’re a passionate person. But before jumping into a fight, take a beat to think. How is the other person feeling? You probably really care about them and ultimately, want them to feel heard. Sometimes, all you need is a quick second to think and regroup before diving in."

      "content": "Impulsive. Deep down, Leo moons are super high energy and always willing to go after what they want. Sometimes though, their spontaneity can be more inconvenient than exciting. Leo moons might also have a quick temper (especially on their friends’ behalf), which can get them into more confrontations than they’d like. Leo moon, you’re decisive and intense—and that’s great! But before calling someone out and stirring up a conflict, try getting a read from someone else first. Ask a pal what they think (“Did that annoy you as much as it annoyed me? Should I say something?\")."

      "title": "Moon in Aries.",
      "content": "Moon in Aries. As a fellow fire-moon sign, you two will get each other on a deeper level. You both instinctively seek out thrills and invigoration, and you’ll never, ever bore one another. Plus, Aries moons have naturally huge, giving hearts, and that aligns well with your generous spirit. The both of you will love giving each other the world—or, taking over it together. Though, both of you have a natural pull towards leadership, which might cause you to butt heads and fight for control in your relationship. This is where your sun signs can be a huge help—if one or both of you has a more peace-keeping sun sign (Libra, Pisces, Gemini), your compatibility will be even stronger."

      "content": "Moon in Gemini. Deep down, the two of you feel young, wild, and free! Gemini moons and Leos are both all about excitement, variety, laughter, and friendships—your social calendars will stay packed and you’ll dazzle every dinner party with your partner on your arm. Plus, you’ve both got an instinctive talent for great conversation; you'll banter like crazy and keep the other laughing. Gemini moons, though, might fight a deep-seated fear of commitment. Leo moons, on the other hand, feel antsy if their partner isn’t 100% devoted. This solid match will be in A+ territory if Leo moon has a more causal sun sign (Sag, Gemini, or Aquarius) or Gemini moon has a more loyal sun sign (Scorpio, Leo, or Taurus)."

Leo and Libra moons will be one another’s muse—and frankly, one another’s arm candy, too. You two are natural romantics, and together, you’ll luxuriate in a grand, gorgeous love affair. Leo moons have a natural energy and ambition; whereas Libra moons prefer a slower, smoother lifestyle. This might make things tense at times. If Leo moon’s sun sign is a bit calmer (Pisces, Libra, Taurus) or Libra moon’s sun is more intense (Virgo, Capricorn, Aries), then these two will mesh perfectly."

      "content": "Moon in Sagittarius. Leo moons and Sag moons are adventurers at heart. You two will explore each other, explore the world, and explore complex, creative ideas together. The fire between these two will burn bright, and deep down, you’ll share a similar life philosophy: the world is big and there’s a lot to see! As two fire signs, you'll rev each other up, make each other laugh, and admire each other constantly. That said, these two both prefer that the spotlight shine on them. As supportive as they are of their partners, they also crave attention. If either partner has a shyer sun sign (Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, or Cancer), this matchup will go from good to great."

Try climbing the corporate ladder until you get to manage others. Or, choose a role that lets you inspire and entertain other people—for instance, become a museum docent, educator, or tour guide."
