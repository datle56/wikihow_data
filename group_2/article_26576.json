Once he's said his part, you'll have a sense of what he wants—either some advice or just a sympathetic ear. Listening is a skill that can be developed. Work on latching on to the details of what he says and mentioning them later. He'll be impressed by how much you care. According to Keegan, you don't have to agree or go along with everything your man says. But you should still \"listen to [them]\" and \"let [them] be themselves.\" [9] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 28 September 2021."

If he likes reading in his study or working on his carpentry skills in the garage, don't hover around him asking what he's up to. If he hasn't been keeping up with his hobbies lately, encourage him to get back into what makes him happy. Your respect and encouragement of his independence is a super loving act.

Make sure to keep up with your hobbies, too! It's important that you both maintain your independence and a life outside of your relationship. At the same time, try to learn more about his interests so you can talk to him about them.

You're going to learn things from your partner, and you're going to be exposed to things via your partner that you might not have otherwise been exposed to.\" [12] X Expert Source Michelle Jacoby Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 September 2021."
