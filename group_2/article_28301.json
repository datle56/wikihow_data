      "content": "Clear the bed of anything in your way. If you’re washing your sheets, clear everything off of the bed. If you’re just redoing your bed, remove whatever is going to get in the way. You may want to take off pillows, stuffed animals, your comforter, etc. Take the duvet/blanket off, the top sheet, and any pillows and set them aside on a clean surface. You can leave the fitted sheet on the bed if you aren’t replacing it."

      "title": "Put the fitted sheet on.",
      "content": "Put the fitted sheet on. If the fitted sheet is not already on the bed, add it now. Tuck the elastic ends of the sheet around the four corners of the mattress. Tuck the corners of the mattress tightly. You may need to lift the mattress slightly to achieve this. Smooth the fitted sheet out to remove any creases or wrinkles. Fitted sheets are notoriously annoying about staying down when you move from one corner to another. If you have a friend or family member willing to help, ask them for some assistance—at least on this part—if you’re struggling."

      "title": "Put the top sheet on and smooth it out.",
      "content": "Put the top sheet on and smooth it out. Spread the top sheet over the fitted sheet. Put the side with the large hem at the top of the bed and align it with the head of the mattress to keep everything neat and tidy. If you have patterned sheets, put the patterned side face down so you can see the pattern when the top of the sheet is folded back. If you aren’t folding the top, feel free to put it down patterned-side-up. Spread the top sheet evenly over the mattress so that the same length of sheet is hanging over both sides of the bed. If the top sheet was sitting in the dryer for a while and the wrinkles just won’t go away, iron your bed! Preheat the iron and gently run it back and forth to smooth everything out.

      "content": "Tuck in the sheet to make hospital corners for a cleaner look. The term “hospital corner” refers to a specific method of folding the end of the top sheet tightly under the mattress. It really adds that extra “wow” factor to your bed to give it that super-neat look. Here’s how to do it: Tuck the bottom end of the top sheet in between the mattress and the box spring to start. On one side, grab a piece of the top sheet approximately 16 inches (40.6 cm) away from the foot of the bed. Lift it up and fold the sheet over the top of the mattress, so it forms a 45-degree angle from the corner of the mattress. Holding the folded piece of sheet in place on top of the mattress, tuck in any sheet hanging below the mattress on that side of the bed. Now, let the folded piece of the sheet on top of the mattress drop down. Tuck the hanging edge of the sheet smoothly between the mattress and box springs, all the way along the side of the bed. Repeat this process on the opposite side of the bed."

      "title": "Place the duvet or comforter on top.",
      "content": "Place the duvet or comforter on top. Once the top sheets are tucked in place, lay your blankets, duvet, or comforter on top. Smooth it all out by hand. Set the top edge of the duvet/comforter/blanket so it’s 6 in (15 cm) away from the edge of the top sheet at the head of the bed. A blanket is a general term for anything that keeps you warm. A comforter is a single sheet, while duvets have an insert and a cover. Usually, duvets are warmer, while comforters are ideal if you prefer it to be cooler when you sleep."

      "title": "Fold the top sheet and duvet down a few inches.",
      "content": "Fold the top sheet and duvet down a few inches. Take the edge of the top sheet at the head of the bed and neatly fold it back over 4–12 inches (10–30 cm) from the top edge of the duvet, blanket, or comforter. Notice how you can see the pattern on the inside of the sheet now? If you're using a blanket or thin comforter, fold the blanket and sheet back together, so the hem of the sheet is no longer visible. Duvets are usually a little too thick to fold. If you like, you can tuck the edges of the folded blanket and sheet underneath the mattress for a very neat and tightly made bed. This is how they do it in the military. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fluff the pillows for a more luxurious vibe. Grab your pillows and give them a good fluffing before you place them on the bed. Grab the pillow on either side and squeeze the sides together firmly and repeatedly—kind of like you’re playing the accordion! [3] X Research source Smooth out the pillow cases then lay each pillow flat at the head of the bed to fill the space between the folded-over comforter and the headboard. If you have more than two pillows, stack the extra pillows directly on top of the first set. Alternatively, you can lean the pillows vertically against the headboard to make your bed look bigger than it actually is. If you have pillows of different sizes, stack them in a pyramid shape with each row incorporating the next smallest set of pillows."

Take any decorative cushions or pillows you might have and place them in an upright position at the head of the bed, leaning against the sleeping pillows for support. [4] X Research source If you have an additional blanket, quilt, or throw blanket that you like to keep on your bed for aesthetic purposes (or in case it gets cold!), fold it neatly in half and lay it evenly over the bottom half of the bed."

      "content": "Choose sheets and pillows that complement your room. Look around your room to see what style you’re cultivating. If you’ve got a more old-school vibe, choose a duvet cover with some antique frills. If your room is crisp and modern, select simple bedding. Take the color scheme into account, as well. Opt for similar or contrasting colors so everything meshes well [9] X Research source There is nothing wrong with keeping the bed sheets and pillows white. In fact, an all-white vibe will really feel luxurious in most rooms."

Now, through the duvet cover, grab the top corners of the duvet firmly, with one corner in each hand. Hold the corners and shake the duvet until the duvet cover turns itself right-side out. Then, tuck the bottom corners of the duvet inside and snap, button, or zipper the cover shut. [10] X Research source If you find yourself struggling, enlist the help of a family member or friend. Duvet covers are notoriously obnoxious, so don’t get frustrated."

Just make sure it's the appropriate size for your bed. [11] X Research source The mattress pad or topper goes on over the mattress, but under the fitted sheet. It protects the mattress from becoming dirty, while also adding an extra layer of comfort to the bed. Mattress toppers are ideal if you want a little extra cushion when you sleep. If you just want to protect the mattress alone, get a pad. You can also place a bed skirt around the box springs to hide it and the space between the frame and the floor."
