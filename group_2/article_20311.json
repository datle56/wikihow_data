As you gamble, you'll gain player's points that can go towards free benefits which can include a free or upgraded room. You can sign up for a player's card on the casino's website or you can go to the front desk and request one."

When you sign up for your player's card, make sure to give the casino your name and address so that they can send you the offers in the mail. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Insert your player's card into the slot machine. If you play slots, inserting your player's card into the machine will track how much you're betting and how often. Insert your card in the slot made for the player's card. The longer you play, the greater the chance of you receiving perks like a free room."

      "title": "Give your players card to the dealer when playing table games.",
      "content": "Give your players card to the dealer when playing table games. When you play table or card games, there is no slot for your player's card. Your dealer will pass your card to the pit boss, who will monitor how much you're betting and whether you're a good gambler. When you're done at a table, ask to get your player's card back.

      "title": "Gamble in a specific casino frequently.",
      "content": "Gamble in a specific casino frequently. The more frequently you visit a single casino, the more the staff will start to recognize you. If the pit boss or host know you as someone who gambles a lot, they will be more likely to come up to you and give you perks like a free room. [3] X Research source Be polite to all staff including waitresses, desk staff, the host, and the dealers so that you leave a good impression on the casino."

    {
      "title": "Gamble for four hours or longer.",
      "content": "Gamble for four hours or longer. The casino is concerned with how much money you're willing to gamble with and how long you gamble with that money. Making a few of really high bets is less likely to get you a room than spending three or four hours at 60 cent slots. Manage your budget, and make sure that you can make moderate sized bets for a long period of time. The longer that you gamble, the more impressive your play history will look and the more likely that the host or pit boss will notice you."

      "content": "Make a high first and last bet. Making a high bet when you start and finish will get the attention of dealers, the pit boss, and the host. These are the people who will eventually give you a free room, so it's a good strategy to make a high bet as your first and last impression. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Play with promotional chips. If you signed up for a player's card and provided your address, casinos will sometimes send you offers for promotional chips. These are chips that can't be cashed out, but can be used in a specific casino for play. Playing with promotional chips may still add to your player's points and it will also make it seem like you're playing for a longer time with real money. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Play in a smaller casino.",
      "content": "Play in a smaller casino. Smaller casinos are often less busy, which means that they typically have more vacant rooms and are more willing to give you a free one. Larger casinos are also more likely to have high-rollers which can be difficult to compete with if you aren't gambling with a lot of money. If you aren't a big gambler or don't have much money to spend, your money will go further in a smaller casino. The Mandalay Bay and Venetian are two of the largest casinos in Las Vegas, while Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon and Casino Royale are two smaller casinos on the strip. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Gamble on weekdays during the off-season.",
      "content": "Gamble on weekdays during the off-season. The months of July, August, and December are the slowest for Las Vegas. In addition, the city will be cheaper during the week than it is during the weekend. There is a greater chance of rooms being vacant and this improves your chance of getting a comped or free room. In July and August it's too hot in Las Vegas for many vacationers. Unlike other vacation spots, the city stays fairly busy even in these off-times, so it's not a guarantee that you'll get a free room."

      "content": "Ask to talk to the host. The host is a person in the casino that can make the decision to give you a comped room. If you've been playing for a long time and have been gambling a good amount of money, stop a waitress or go to the front desk and ask to speak with the host. [7] X Research source You can say something like “Excuse me, I'd like to speak with the host so they can review my play history. Thanks.”"

      "content": "Ask the host to take a look at your play history. If you've been playing for long enough, the employee you asked will bring over the host. Introduce yourself to the host and shake their hand. Then, ask them if they can take a look at your play history. Give them your player's card and they will evaluate what they can give you for free. Let them know that you're interested in a free room and tell them that you'll continue gambling during your stay there. [8] X Research source You can say something like “Can you take a look at my play history and let me know what comps are available to me? I'm interested in getting a comped room.” Remember to tip the host with at least $50 if they do comp you a room."

If you haven't been able to get ahold of a host but have gambled all night, go to the player's desk, give them your player's card, and ask what comps are available to you. The player's desk will take your player's card and evaluate how many points you've gained while gambling. If it's enough points, it may qualify for a free room. [9] X Research source Say something like, “Can you take a look at my play history and tell me what comps I can get? I was interested in getting a comped room for the night.”"

Staff, pit bosses, and hosts are likely to remember you. If you remain polite throughout the experience and continue visiting the same casino, they will be more likely to comp you a room in the future."
