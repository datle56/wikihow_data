Only do this outside, NEVER in your house or anywhere else you don't want to badly stink up. Remember, the longer you leave it, the more wicked it's stench will be. A good indicator that it's ready is being able to detect a whiff from a few feet away after two or three weeks."

      "content": "Unleash. Either open or break the jar in the area you want to stink and watch as people rapidly clear away from the obnoxious, haunting, suffocating stench. An alternative way of doing this is instead of using the whole jar, screen the rancid juice from the putrid mix with an old strainer into a small 2 Oz. pump spray bottle (one of those small clear plastic ones used for travel) and spray where you want to stink, just don't get caught and don't get any of this on you otherwise you will be in for a very smelly time."
