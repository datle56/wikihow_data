      "content": "Catch him glancing at you. If a shy guy likes you, he might be afraid to talk to you. Instead, he will probably try to steal some glances in your direction. If you notice him looking at you, he will look away as quickly as possible. This doesn't mean he doesn't like you. In fact, it can mean just the opposite.

      "content": "Notice him light up when he sees you. If he likes you, he might light up when you come around. Look for a smile and a twinkle in his eyes when he sees you. This might mean that he likes you, especially if he doesn't react this way when other people come around. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Take note of awkward interactions. If he likes you, he will probably be nervous around you. If he seems especially awkward around you (dropping things, stumbling over his words) it might mean he likes you. [3] X Research source You can help ease his awkwardness by giving him your undivided attention. Also, avoid laughing at him if he drops something or stumbles over his words."

      "content": "Notice him saying \"hi\" to you. If a shy guy likes you, he might not be able to walk right up to you and start a conversation. Instead, he might only be able to say hello. If he waves at you, nods, or musters a quiet \"hi\" (especially if he's not doing this for other people), he might have the hots for you. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk with him on social media. Fortunately for shy guys, talking in person isn't the only way to communicate. If he tries to communicate with you on social media (or by text message, email, or paper notes), even if he doesn't talk with you much in person, it could be a good sign. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't be upset if he talks to your friends. If you are standing around with a group of friends and this shy guy walks up and starts talking to them, it could actually be a good sign. It is possible that he is just working up the courage to talk to you by talking to you friends. [6] X Research source"

It might be very difficult for him to start interacting with you one-on-one, so try to be patient and focused for him! Remember: if he is awkward it probably just means he is nervous. [7] X Research source You show you are paying attention to him by: Nodding when he speaks. Maintaining eye contact. Providing verbal cues (things like \"sure,\" \"yeah,\" \"totally\"). Responding when it's your turn to speak. Avoiding looking at your phone."
