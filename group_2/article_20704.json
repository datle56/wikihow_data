Click on your bakery’s name, and type over it with any name you like. Click Confirm to earn this achievement. Tiny cookie – Click the “Stats” button in the center panel. Look for the text “Cookies baked (all time).” Click on the tiny cookie image next to that text. If that doesn’t work, find and click the two other tiny cookie icons on the page.

Now that you’ve resized your window so that the Cookie and Milk are touching (aka, it looks like your Big Cookie is being dunked in the milk), let it sit there for a few seconds. This will give the computer time to recognize that the cookie is being dunked."

If you’re playing the web version of Cookie Clicker on your cell phone, it’s more difficult to dunk the cookie as you can’t resize your window. However, users have reported being able to unlock the achievement on mobile, but there doesn’t seem to be one straightforward route that’s worked for everyone. You can try rotating your screen to landscape view, or just try to unlock as many achievements as possible so that the milk level rises (you can hack the game to get there faster)."
