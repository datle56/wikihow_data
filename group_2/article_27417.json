      "title": "Get a big pot.",
      "content": "Get a big pot. This should be large enough to put the entire, ramen into without having to break it (you can break it if that is your preference). It should also be small enough so that water can completely cover the ramen noodles. Some people like to eat ramen wet instead of completely drained, so if that's the case, you can be more generous with the water."

      "title": "Pour your preferred amount of water into the pot.",
      "content": "Pour your preferred amount of water into the pot. If in doubt, try 2 cups, but if you want more, that'll work, too. You can substitute some other liquid for the water, such as soy sauce, or broth, but water will work as well."

    {
      "title": "Boil the water.",
      "content": "Boil the water. On most stoves, you should just turn the knob as high as it can go and wait for the water to boil . If, during the cooking process, the pan starts to bubble over the top, just turn it down. Next time you make ramen, do not turn the stove on as high as it can go. So long as the water is bubbling, its temperature is at the boiling point and it is circulating. A furious boil adds little and risks a boil-over, so feel free to turn down the heat a bit once boiling commences."

      "content": "Add the ramen once the water is at a full boil. Use a fork to push the block under the water if it is floating on the top. You can choose to break the block into chunks before adding it, if you prefer shorter, less slurp-able noodles, but it is a personal thing."

      "content": "Wait. Three minutes is the normal cooking time, it may take longer, though. [1] X Expert Source Thuong Tan Noodle Expert Expert Interview. 28 January 2021. When the noodles are starting to turn slightly yellow, they are done. At this point, the ramen should be completely broken apart, and, when you put your fork in the water, a few noodles attach themselves to your fork. The ramen is ready to eat when it is flexible. If it cooks a few minutes longer, it will become softer, fatter, and translucent. You may prefer it this way."

This works great if you live in a college dorm that doesn't allow microwaves in each room. All you have to do is put them into a bowl and pour hot water over the noodles. Let sit for about three minutes and add the seasoning packet."
