      "content": "Cut the plywood or other wood to size. Cut it slightly larger than your laptop's dimensions. Add about 2 centimeters (0.75 inches) on each side for extra space. The wood should be around 1.25 centimeters (0.5 inches) thick. Measure the wood after cutting. Adjust, if necessary."

      "title": "Drill holes.",
      "content": "Drill holes. Make the holes about 2 centimeters (0.75 inches) apart in a grid pattern on the board. You should be able to fit a pencil through the holes, but not much more. If you have serious overheating problems, drill the holes closer together. You will also need to buy fans and plug them into each hole. Or, you can simply disassemble something that already has a fan that you don't need."

      "content": "If your laptop does not have 'feet' under it (pads that raise it up), glue on something to help raise the pad and laptop a bit. This is important for ensuring adequate air circulation. The image shows use of wood to make feet; this is a great way to use up scrap wood. Alternatively, small rubber, plastic or similar feet can be purchased from the hardware store. Non-slip designs work best."

      "title": "Vacuum lightly over the board.",
      "content": "Vacuum lightly over the board. This will prevent any wood particles from getting sucked into your computer by the fan. Screw the fans under the board. Make sure they are attached on the holes you created."

      "content": "Customize your cooling pad by painting it any way you want. If you aren't very artistic, use a paint that complements your laptop. If the wood is nice enough (not particleboard), you could use a nice wood stain."
