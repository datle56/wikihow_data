      "content": "The heat of boiling water kills the maggots on contact. Set a large pot of water over high heat for about 5 minutes so it comes to a boil. Once the water is bubbling, pour the water slowly and carefully over any areas that are infested with maggots. Within seconds, the water will kill the maggots so you’re able to get rid of any material they were feeding on without them spreading. [1] X Research source If the maggots are in the trash bin, close the lid to keep in the heat and more effectively kill an infestation . Boiling water works best outside or in garbage bins. Avoid using this method on your walls or carpet since the heat and moisture can lead to structural damage and mold growth."

      "content": "Salt quickly dehydrates maggots to control them. Take a scoop of rock salt and spread it liberally onto the maggots to coat them. Watch the maggots for a few minutes until they stop moving, and sprinkle more salt on them if they’re still alive after about 5 minutes. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source Salt draws the water out of the maggots’ bodies and causes them to die of water pressure deficiency Alternatively, use garden lime to help control maggots in your yard or garden."

      "title": "Diatomaceous earth",
      "content": "Diatomaceous earth cuts into the maggot to kill it faster. Diatomaceous earth is a natural powder that sticks to the maggot to draw out moisture. Apply diatomaceous earth over the maggots so they’re completely covered. Wait about 5 minutes and check if the maggots are still alive. If they are, sprinkle a little more diatomaceous earth onto them. Diatomaceous earth works great for treating along baseboards, deep in carpet fibers, inside of your garbage cans, or around your yard. Diatomaceous earth can cause irritation, so avoid using it anywhere where kids or pets could get into it.

      "title": "Maggots can’t survive exposure to an acidic vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Maggots can’t survive exposure to an acidic vinegar solution. Mix 1 part white distilled vinegar with 2 parts hot water in a spray bottle. Spray any areas that are infested with maggots to coat them with the solution and kill them. Alternatively, dump the solution directly over the infested area. While the solution will start working instantly, wait about 1 hour for the solution to kill all of the maggots. Apply this spray to the insides of your garbage cans once a week to help keep flies and maggots from coming back."

      "content": "Maggots make a perfect snack for hungry birds. If the maggots are in a trash bin or another container, take it outside and leave the lid open. Let birds find the bin and catch the maggots that are inside so they have a nutritious meal while helping you get rid of pests. If there are still maggots left over at the end of the day, use another control method to ensure they don’t spread to other parts of your yard."

      "title": "Maggots can’t survive long in freezing temperatures.",
      "content": "Maggots can’t survive long in freezing temperatures. Brush the maggot infestation into a dustpan and pour them into a resealable plastic bag. Make sure the bag is sealed tightly before putting it in a freezer separate from your food. Leave the bag in the freezer for at least 1 hour to kill all the maggots. After that, just toss the bag in your trash can. [4] X Research source This works best for smaller infestations and if you have freezer space away from food."

      "title": "Contact with bleach or its fumes quickly takes care of infestations.",
      "content": "Contact with bleach or its fumes quickly takes care of infestations. Mix equal amounts of bleach and water together in a plastic or metal bowl. If you're dumping the mixture directly onto the area, gently pour it over the maggots to kill them. Alternatively, use a spray bottle to apply the solution liberally onto the infested area. Let the bleach sit for about 30 minutes before dumping out the solution and disposing of the maggots. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source If you're dumping bleach into a trash can, close the lid after pouring it and let the fumes suffocate the maggots. Bleach can damage or discolor carpets and flooring, so always test the solution in an inconspicuous spot before applying it completely."

      "content": "Chemical insecticides work well against serious infestations. Use a general insect spray for flies like Raid since they effectively kill maggots on contact. Alternatively, look for a permethrin pesticide , which helps get rid of maggots and fly eggs. Apply the spray directly onto the maggots and the surrounding areas to ensure you kill all of them. [6] X Research source Chemical insecticides cause eye and lung irritation, so wear safety glasses and a face mask while you’re using them. Permethrin and synthetic pyrethroids can be fatal to cats, so avoid using them near your pets. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Maggots aren’t attracted to areas without a food source. Flies normally lay their eggs in wet trash because it's an easy food source. To prevent maggots from getting in your trash , keep all your trash tightly sealed in bags so they don’t leak. Whenever there’s a spill, wipe it up right away to prevent infestations. Other things that work well to prevent maggots are: [8] X Research source Rinsing food containers before throwing them away Keeping garbage cans sealed tightly Putting screens on your windows to prevent flies from getting in Storing food and pet food indoors in airtight containers Hanging fly traps near your garbage cans Cleaning your garbage disposal"
