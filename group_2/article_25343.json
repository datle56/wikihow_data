      "content": "Stay home if you have a fever over 100 °F (38 °C). Fever is your body’s natural reaction to an infection or an illness. Although a fever can be caused by lots of different things, if you have a high fever, you are most likely contagious and you need to stay home from work or school to avoid spreading your illness to anybody else. [1] X Research source Stay at home until your body temperature gets back to a normal range, which is usually around 98 °F (37 °C), and stays there for 24 hours. Taking medication to reduce your fever does not make you less contagious. A high fever is also likely to be accompanied by periods of sweating and chills."

      "content": "Avoid leaving your home if you have uncontrollable coughing. If you have a cough that you aren’t able to control, or your cough is accompanied by scratchiness in your throat or difficulty breathing, it could be a sign of a respiratory illness. Many of these are highly contagious. Stay home from work or school so you don’t spread anything to the people who are in proximity to you. [2] X Research source Mild coughing frequently occurs due to a cold or allergies. You may also have a stuffy, drippy nose and sneezing. If you feel up to it and no other symptoms are present, you can still go about your daily routine. Coughing that feels like it comes from deep within your lungs could be a sign of a serious infection, such as pneumonia. Some viral illnesses, like the flu or COVID-19, also feature coughing as a symptom. Contact your doctor to see if you should get your cough checked out. Cover your mouth when you cough and wash your hands frequently. This will help prevent you from spreading germs and viruses. If you have trouble breathing during coughing fits, go to the emergency room to get medical attention."
