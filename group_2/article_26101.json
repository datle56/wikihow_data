      "content": "Bike everywhere you go. In 2013, more Europeans bought and rode bikes than they did cars. The 3.6 million people who bike in Great Britain is almost twice the number of people who travel by car. In Greece, there are over five times more bikers than there are drivers. Instead of relying on your normal routine, buy a bike and take it to work. You will be travelling like millions of Europeans while saving money and improving your health. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Take public transportation. Most European nations have extensive bus and train systems that are utilized daily by residents. Germany has the Bahn, Italy has the Metropolitan, and Paris has the MÃ©tro, which locals take around these cities everyday. Instead of taking your car to work, figure out the bus routes that go between your house and work. You can also take a metro train. This will make you feel more European and save you money in the process. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source [4] X Research source One of the most multi-functional public transit systems is in London, which has Transport for London (TfL), an extensive network of buses, underground and overground trains, ferries, and trams that run all hours of the day. The TfL is also affiliated with an airline and cross country train service. The Brits take these modes of transportation everyday, wherever they go. The red double-decker buses that pepper the streets of London are known all over the world. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy an environmentally friendly car.",
      "content": "Buy an environmentally friendly car. An overwhelming number of Americans drive large, gas-guzzling SUVs, while Europeans lean toward small, compact cars that get a much better fuel consumption rate. In Italy and France, you are much more likely to find a Fiat 500, Mini Cooper, and Smart car than you are a Cadillac Escalade. This is mostly due to how little space there is on the streets, especially in big cities. If you need to drive, or just prefer it, think about buying a Fiat 500 or Mini Cooper. Not only will the cars help you feel like a European, they are easier to drive around, are cost efficient, and better for the environment. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Walk more.",
      "content": "Walk more. Whether it is shopping or going out with friends, many Europeans take their time and walk to the shops or restaurants that they need to get to. The design of the city of Paris is made for strolls, with its walkways along the Seine River, sidewalk cafes on every corner, and large, tree-lined avenues. Try walking more in your everyday life. Walk to the store to pick up a few things or walk to a local restaurant for dinner. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source Europeans also tend to go for evening strolls. There is rarely a night that you don't see people strolling through the streets of Venice or through the parks in France. Add in a nice after dinner walk with your spouse, family, friends, or roommates. It helps you unwind after the day and will give you time to spend with those you care about. If you don't live in a place that is necessarily conducive to walking, try driving near wherever you need to go and then walk to the specific location you need to get to. This allows you to walk more and you can cut out some of the stress of traffic and parking."

      "content": "Change up what you cook with and eat. In Europe, people are much more into locally grown food and local restaurants. It is hard to go through any major city in Europe such as London, Paris, or Florence without seeing people selling local produce on the side of the street. Find the farmer's market in your town and buy as much fresh food as possible. Also start eating at locally owned eateries. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Reduce your portions.",
      "content": "Reduce your portions. The average portion size in American restaurants is much larger than most in Europe. Even with home cooked meals, in Europe they eat much smaller portions during each meal. Try to change the portions that you eat. You can make less food at home with smaller portions at each meal. If you go out, try splitting your portions with someone else or taking the leftovers home for lunch the next day. In France, they eat much smaller portions than in the United States. For breakfast, the French simply have a piece of fruit or a croissant with their cafe latte, if they have breakfast at all. They have larger lunches, where they eat pasta, protein, vegetables, and fruit, typically in large groups. For dinner, the French likely have another small meal with their families, full of fruits, vegetables, and protein. Take your time while you eat smaller portions of foods that you truly enjoy."

      "content": "Try different desserts. European desserts are known for being decadent and delicious. Look for a bakery that specializes in European treats. Find some recipes for traditional European desserts. You also might be able to find imported options at the grocery store. [13] X Research source [14] X Research source Search for an Italian bakery near you. Italian bakeries are known for cannoli, which come in flavors such as traditional ricotta, chocolate, strawberry, limoncello, and even caramel pecan and pumpkin. These bakeries also carry ricotta pie, meringues, florentine cookies, and lobster tails, which are multi-layer pastries. If you can't find a bakery in your area, try making some recipes at home. Try a traditional German streusel or Black Forrest cake. Make sure you look for recipes that detail how to bake them in the same way they are made in Germany. You want your desserts to be just like they are when they are made by locals. You can sometimes find European dessert options at a grocery store. Many American companies have put out their own line of gelato, which is kind of like a creamy sorbet and ice cream fusion popular all over Europe, especially Italy."

      "title": "Buy imported foods.",
      "content": "Buy imported foods. There are many foods and brands in Europe that aren't available in the US. Even brands that are available in the US taste different in Europe. Look for a world market or grocery store that sells imported foods. If you can't find a store, look for international stores online that ship to the US. Look for gourmet cheeses such as Italian Asiago, Parmesan, and Mozzarella or French Brie or Cantalet. Pair them with honey, nuts, or grapes. Try to find imported brands like il Giardino or Henri Hutin instead of the brands distributed in the US. Some of the best chocolates you can get are from Belgium. Try Valerie's Gaufre Choco Wafel or Ambiente White Praline chocolate bar. American candies such as Starburst and KitKat offer different flavors in other countries. Starbursts offers the black currant flavor in Ireland. KitKats in Italy are offered in caramel flavor. Try to find a store that sells these imported candies in order to enjoy the variations of flavors."

      "title": "Go to pubs.",
      "content": "Go to pubs. Many European countries, such as Germany, Czechia, Wales, and Ireland, have drinking establishments called pubs (short for public house) or taverns. Unlike bars in the United States, pubs are full services restaurants where people spend time, play a pub quiz, or bring their families. Though some pubs have extensive cocktail menus, the main thing they serve is beer, wine, spirits and cider. You can spend a whole night in a pub, eating with your friends watching a local band play. Pubs are so popular that there are actually quite a few in the US. Look for a pub in your neighborhood. On your next outing with your friends, spend a night away from the hustle and bustle of a bar and settle on a pub instead. [15] X Research source If you don't like the pub atmosphere, look for a Spanish tavern called a taberna or tapas bar. They are found in many large cities in the US such as Boston and San Francisco. These establishments serve regional Spanish cuisine and have a full wine and cocktail menus. If you can't get to one of these establishments, try some imported alcohol instead. France and Italy are known for their wines, so try out a bottle with a French or Italian vintage. Drink imported beer such as Guinness from Ireland, Chimay from Belgium, Carlsberg from Denmark, Nastro Azzurro from Italy, or Heineken from the Netherlands. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch European television. Although many European countries air shows from the US, they have a rich expanse of television all their own. Whether it's a German soap opera such as Verbotene Liebe ( Forbidden Love ) or a British crime dramas such as Sherlock , try watching shows made in other countries. You can find many of them online from broadcast networks or steaming companies such as Netflix. As another option, try to find European-based television channels streaming live on the internet or on cable/satellite to get the full experience. There are options all over Europe to choose from. Britain has great shows such as the sci-fi megahit Doctor Who and the thriller Luther , Denmark has political drama Borgen , and France has horror-drama The Returned , just to name a few. If you aren't a TV person, try some foreign films instead. There are many great international films playing in the US at art houses or independent movie theaters. You can also look for European or country-based film festivals in your area such as the Boston French Film Festival in Massachusetts or the Nuovo Cinema Italiano Film Festival in Charleston, South Carolina."

      "title": "Change your wardrobe.",
      "content": "Change your wardrobe. Although Europeans and Americans dress in similar ways, there are some things you can do to make you look more European by comparison. European style is typically dressier than American style, but younger Europeans are shifting toward a more casual style. Dress classic and simple. Stay away from over the top ensembles or super casual outfits. Look to London and Paris fashion week, both on the runway and off, for tips about how stylish European women and men are dressing. To know more on what it means to dress European, then go to How to Dress European on wikiHow. Try stores such as H&M, Ben Sherman, Belstaff, Topshop, Hugo Boss, Topman, Lacoste, Mango, Zara, United Colors of Benetton, and Reiss. H&M, Lacoste, and Zara are popular all over Europe. If you are a guy, make sure your clothes fit nicely. Avoid bright colors and shorts, unless you are on the coast. Try wearing a nice fitting polo shirt with a pair of fitted jeans. For going out at night, try an earth toned button up or sweater with a pair of dark jeans. You can even add a scarf to tie any outfit together. [17] X Research source European women, especially the French, are known for their fashion. Whether they are going to the grocery store or are out for a walk with their children, French women are dressed to impress in skirts, dresses, and heels. Keep your fashion simple but elegant. Wear a pair of skinny jeans in black or red, a slightly chunky sweater, a scarf or long necklace, and a handbag. Top the whole outfit off with designer heels or boots, and you'll look just like you stepped off a street in Paris. [18] X Research source No matter your gender, avoid wearing athletic shoes and clothes unless you are doing something sporty. Also avoid flip flops unless you are at the beach. Europeans don't typically wear these kinds of shoes or clothes unless they have a reason to. Wearing unwarranted sporty clothing will make you look like a European delinquent, so try to steer clear of them if you can. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Watch \"football\".",
      "content": "Watch \"football\". American football is something very different than football in Europe. Football, also known as footie, is what Americans know as soccer. Find a team to follow. Learn the teams that are in rivalries and the teams that are likely to go to the Champions League, which is the championship of the sport. You can even get your friends involved, watching it with them at your house or at a local pub. [20] X Research source [21] X Research source If you are ever asked whether you support one team or another team, it's safest to not answer. Chances are, the teams have a huge rivalry. England, Germany, Italy, Greece and many other European countries are known for their football hooligans, who are rowdy fans who typically cause trouble, destroy property, and get arrested. Although the trend has declined in recent years, there are some Europeans who are still serious about their footie. [22] X Research source [23] X Research source If footie isn't your game, try to watch tennis or cricket instead. These sports are also popular all over Europe. [24] X Research source"

      "title": "Change how you measure.",
      "content": "Change how you measure. Europeans use a different system of measurements and temperature. Instead of the Imperial/US customary unit measurements that use inches, feet, and pounds, use the Metric system , which is made up of meters, liters, and grams. You should also start expressing the temperature by Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. This will make you sound like a European and do things in the same fashion as they do. Not only will you sound European, but you will be part of the more than 90% of people all around the world that use the same system of measurement! [25] X Research source For example, the Austrians would say that the distance between Vienna, Austria and Munich, Germany is 355 kilometres (221 mi) They would also say the temperature in Vienna was 25 Â°C (77 Â°F)"

      "title": "Slow down.",
      "content": "Slow down. Americans often rush between one activity and the next, forgetting to take time to enjoy life. Europeans take time in their day to enjoy things. Whether it's long lunches in France, midday respites in Italy, or siestas in Spain, Europeans know how to relax and enjoy the small things. Take half an hour to regroup and destress in the afternoon. Enjoy your lunch hour instead of rushing around and scarfing your food down. [26] X Research source [27] X Research source [28] X Research source One of the best ways to accomplish this is to take longer vacations. On average, Europeans receive and take more vacation days than people in the United States. Instead of skipping your vacations until you have more money or less to do at work, take your week long vacation and enjoy yourself. Plan a trip that won't break the bank or spend the week relaxing with those you love. Just don't think about work and leave all your stress behind."

      "content": "Value community over convenience. Europeans know when to sit and enjoy each other's company. In France, people often take long, extended lunches where they congregate in groups to socialize and eat a meal together. Instead of skipping dinner with your family because you are all too busy, sit down and eat together. You can all talk about your day and enjoy each other's company without rushing around. [29] X Research source Americans are often overly nice to each other and can become sensitive when someone tells them something they are doing wrong. Europeans tend to be more critical, but in a constructive way. The French are known for their frankness and are typically thought of as too honest. When your friends ask how they are doing on a task, tell them the truth instead of trying to preserve their feelings. They will become a better person for it and you will have a closer, more honest relationship with them. [30] X Research source"

      "title": "Smile less.",
      "content": "Smile less. In Europe, people don't typically smile at everyone they pass like they do in the US. In Germany and France, you won't see locals walking around, saying \"Guten Morgen\" or \"Bonjour\" and smiling at people. They save their smiles for occasions that warrant smiling, which makes the act more genuine. Instead of smiling at everyone you see or when you really don't mean it, smile only when you are truly pleased or amused by something. This will make your attention more special and make you seem more European. [31] X Research source [32] X Research source"
