      "content": "Gorpcore is a fashion aesthetic inspired by hiking and outdoor clothing. Essentially, gorpcore turns functional and practical clothing associated with hiking and camping into trendy streetwear—the purpose of the aesthetic is to embrace the outdoors while looking good doing it. Think structured waterproof jackets, shiny nylon puffer vests, cargo pants with lots of pockets and zippers, and sturdy hiking shoes. [1] X Research source The essence of gorpcore is about incorporating functional outdoor pieces into your style. Each piece you wear has a purpose, whether it keeps you warm or helps you navigate rough terrain. While gorpcore is a fashion aesthetic, many people embrace the lifestyle and activities it's associated with, like camping, hiking, skiing, climbing, and simply spending time outdoors. The name “Gorpcore” likely comes from the acronym “Good Ol’ Raisins and Peanuts,” which is a popular trail mix snack for hikers. Gorpcore was first coined by Jason Chen in his 2017 article for The Cut . It started gaining traction during the COVID-19 pandemic and reached peak popularity in 2023."
