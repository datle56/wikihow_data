When she stops texting, calling, and asking you to hang out, something is up. An Aries woman who doesn’t want your focus on her 24/7 may not see you as a romantic interest anymore. Aries are normally quite affectionate when they want their partner’s attention, but she’ll stop doing it if she feels it’s a waste of time. She may only be unsure about the future of your relationship, in which case you can reassure her that you’re as loyal as she is and committed for the long haul. On the other hand, she may be distancing herself to prepare for the ensuing breakup."

[3] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. Expert psychic Stina Garbis says that \"if she is not seeking time with or attention from you and she has nothing else going on, that may be a sign her interest is wandering or she is getting bored.\" So, if she never makes an effort to hang out with you, it could signify that she doesn’t have romantic feelings for you. This is her way of distancing to prepare you for a rejection or a breakup."

      "content": "To reject someone, Aries will hit the brakes and keep things casual. If you’re not dating (but had been previously flirting), she might make a point to introduce you as a “friend” to other people. If you’re together, she’ll act more like a casual friend or acquaintance when she sees you to get the point across that her feelings about you are starting to shift. She’ll usually do this if avoiding you isn’t an option—if you work or go to school together."

      "content": "When Aries pulls away, conversations start to feel stale. She won’t put effort into communication, and she’ll stop asking you questions about yourself. An Aries lady is ordinarily quick to ask her crush or partner about their daily life, family, goals, and anything else she’s curious about. Take it as a warning sign if she’s no longer curious! While this is a sign that she’s discontent, it’s not a reason to give up on the relationship. Find out what’s bothering her, and see if she’ll give you a chance to fix the problem first."

Even if you’re not intentionally trying to ask for too much commitment, Aries might feel like a committed relationship is limiting her independence, which could cause her to reject you. Give her the space she needs to realize that she can keep her independence and be with you simultaneously. Try to reassure your Aries that you would never take away her freedom—and that you admire her independence. Ask what else you can do to support her, then let her do her thing."

      "content": "There’s a problem when Aries’ natural passion is nowhere to be found. An Aries lady is only motivated to get physical with someone she has feelings for. If she doesn’t try to touch you—either in the bedroom or casually when you’re together—it’s a big indicator that her heart is somewhere else. As a Cardinal sign, Aries is one of the zodiac’s instigators. She’s normally all about taking the reigns and initiating intimacy with a partner, so it’s easy to notice when she’s losing interest. However, avoiding physical contact doesn’t mean that has no feelings for you anymore. She may just need time to figure out exactly what those feelings are. If you’re respectful of this, she may return to you in time! Try to have an open and non-judgemental conversation with your partner about this issue. Mention that you’ve noticed the dip in intimacy and you’d love to hear their perspective on what’s happening in your relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 1056 wikiHow readers what they’d do if they noticed a lack of passion in their relationship, and 50% of them agreed that they would initiate a conversation with their partner to address the issue .

So, if she’s no longer making an effort to look good and show off around you, she might be moving on. You might notice she doesn’t dress up or wear makeup anymore. Plus, she won’t get jealous of other people who show interest in you—which Aries will typically do if she likes you. Aries women put a lot of effort into relationships, but they also understand it’s a two-way street. If she feels you aren’t putting in as much effort, that may be her reason for rejecting you. Check in with your Aries and make sure she’s satisfied with your effort in the relationship. If she’s not, ask what you can do differently and take her suggestions seriously."

      "content": "Aries is judgmental but rarely complains about the people she cares for. If she thinks a relationship is done, she’ll start to criticize and nitpick your actions. Ruled by Mars, the planet of passion and aggression, Aries isn’t afraid to let people know when she thinks they’re wrong. She might complain that you don’t understand her and blow mistakes out of proportion. If your Aries has a valid criticism—for instance, feeling that you don’t understand her enough—you can sit down and explain that you’re willing to work on this, but it would help if she voiced concerns more constructively. On the other hand, her criticisms may become insults if she feels that you’ve done something wrong. Aries can be vengeful when her partner cheats or otherwise betrays her trust."

It’s in her impatient nature to move on to new challenges before old ones have been fully resolved, so you might actually hear about her intentions to end things from mutual friends rather than her personally. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that she’s not necessarily doing this to hurt you (although it’s perfectly normal to be hurt); she’s just not thinking about the consequences of involving other friends."

She’s not one to keep you guessing or drag out a relationship if she’s not interested anymore. Psychic expert Stina Garbis says that an Aries woman \"cannot hold things back or keep things secret for very long due to her natural courageousness.\" She may be blunt, but if an Aries woman doesn’t feel the same way, she’ll come right out and tell you so. Rather than trying to change her mind, accept it gracefully and do your best to move on, even if you still like her. Aries may second-guess her decision when she sees you living your best life! Even if she doesn’t come back, you deserve to be with someone who understands how awesome you are! If that isn’t her, maybe moving on is for the best."
