      "content": "Find a sharp object. In Arizona, where scorpions are a common sight in bedrooms and backyards, large, long tweezers are sold at hardware stores. These allow you to pierce the exoskeleton, then grasp the scorpion and dispose of it. If this tool isn't available in your area, a pair of scissors with long blades, a long knife, or another long, sharp object will work."

      "title": "Quickly stab the object into the scorpion's body.",
      "content": "Quickly stab the object into the scorpion's body. Scorpions aren't typically very fast, but act quickly to make sure you're able to kill the scorpion before it gets away. If necessary, pierce the scorpion again until you're sure it is no longer alive. You can also use a blunt object, like a heavy book, shoe, or sledgehammer, to crush the scorpion instead of piercing it. However, some scorpions have the ability to flatten themselves as thin as a coin, so just hitting the scorpion with your hard striking surface may not be enough to kill it. You'll need to twist your shoe, rock or other hard object will ensure that the scorpion is crushed and killed. When the scorpion has stopped moving or when its body is in several pieces, it is likely dead."

      "content": "Look for scorpions at night. If scorpions are becoming a problem in your household, you can get rid of them by methodically killing them at night, when they're active. Get a black lightbulb from the hardware store and place it in a flashlight. Shine the light on walls, in corners, along baseboards, and in other areas where scorpions tend to spend time. Their exoskeletons will glow in the black light. [2] X Research source Don't forget to check outside walls on your property, too. Scorpions can also be found in outdoor rock piles and other sources of shelter."

      "content": "Consider hiring a professional pest control agency. If the thought of interacting with scorpions makes you want to run and hide, consider calling a professional to help you out. In some areas you can hire a professional to come to your house and hunt scorpions for you. [3] X Research source Some pest control agencies might suggest using a pesticide application instead of killing the scorpions by hand. It might be worth a try, but many people have found pesticides to be ineffective in getting rid of scorpions."

      "content": "Install a chicken coop. Chickens can eat some of the insects scorpions prey on for food. As such, they'll make the area less inviting to scorpions. Keep in mind that scorpions are nocturnal and chickens are not, so chickens won't have much opportunity to hunt scorpions themselves."

      "content": "Try diatomaceous earth. This natural substance is made from ground up fossils. It's a fine white powder that can be sprinkled in doorways, cracks and crevices both indoors and outdoors. It's completely safe for humans and pets to be around, but the tiny shards of fossil effectively pierce scorpions' exoskeletons when they happen to scuttle over the powder. Diatomaceous earth also kills spiders, roaches and other insects. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Set out sticky traps. The same traps that can be used to get rid of mice or roaches work for scorpions, too. Set them up in dark corners and near sources of water. If you catch a scorpion, throw the trap away and set out another one in the same area, since it's likely a spot that more scorpions will be attracted to."
