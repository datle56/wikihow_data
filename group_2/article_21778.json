      "title": "Choose a windy location where you can hang the wind chimes.",
      "content": "Choose a windy location where you can hang the wind chimes. The name doesn’t lie: wind chimes need wind in order to chime! An outdoor porch or patio that is exposed to wind is the perfect spot to hang your chimes. You can also hang them by your front or back door so you can provoke them every time you pass by. [1] X Research source Place it in an area that isn’t near a bedroom where nighttime chiming might keep someone awake. You can hang them inside as well, but you’ll have to disturb them to hear any chiming."

      "title": "Drill a hole",
      "content": "Drill a hole for the hook using a drill and pilot point bit. First, insert a pilot point bit into a drill—make sure it has a smaller diameter than the hook. Then, drill a small hole into the place where you want to insert the hanging hook. Make the hole about 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep. [2] X Research source You may need to stand on a step ladder if you’re hanging the wind chime from a high ceiling."

    {
      "title": "Twist the pointed end of the ceiling hook clockwise into the ceiling.",
      "content": "Twist the pointed end of the ceiling hook clockwise into the ceiling. Hold the hook by the end with the hanger and insert the sharp end into the pilot hole that you’ve drilled. Then, twist it clockwise until it’s secured in the hole. [3] X Research source You may need to apply some pressure while you make the final twists if the hook screw is longer than the depth of the pilot hole that you drilled."

    {
      "title": "Loop the chain of the wind chimes onto the hook.",
      "content": "Loop the chain of the wind chimes onto the hook. Lift the wind chime by the chain and hook it onto the hook at the desired length. If you’ve made your own wind chime and used a string instead of a chain, tie a sturdy loop at the end of the string to act as a hook. If you want the wind chime to hang lower, hook the last chain link onto the hook. To hang it higher, choose a chain length towards the middle or beginning of the chain."

    {
      "title": "Apply an adhesive J-hook onto a ceiling.",
      "content": "Apply an adhesive J-hook onto a ceiling. If you don’t want to make a hole in the ceiling, you can purchase adhesive hooks specifically made to hang plants and other items from ceilings. Be sure that the wind chime weighs less than the upper weight limit listed on the package. Simply remove the protective strips from the adhesive mount and stick it onto the hanging surface. You may need to apply pressure to the stuck-on mount for up to 1 minute to ensure a firm hold. Refer to the instructions on the package."

      "title": "Mount a plant-hanging bracket onto a vertical wall.",
      "content": "Mount a plant-hanging bracket onto a vertical wall. Use a drill and screws or a hammer and nails to attach a plant hanging bracket onto any vertical wall. After the bracket is in place, attach the wind chime by looping one of the chain links onto the hook. [4] X Research source Make sure the hanging part of the bracket sticks out far enough that the wind chime will have enough room to sway back and forth without hitting the wall."

      "title": "Hang the wind chime from a tall lantern, plant holder, or bird feeder pole.",
      "content": "Hang the wind chime from a tall lantern, plant holder, or bird feeder pole. A tall lantern, plant holder, or bird feeder pole is a great choice if you want to be able to move the wind chime to different locations. A holder that’s at least 4 feet (1.2 m) to 5 feet (1.5 m) tall is ideal, but you could use a shorter one for a small wind chime. [5] X Research source You can buy lanterns, plant holders, and bird feeder poles at garden supply or home hardware stores."

      "title": "Use rope to hang the wind chime from a tree branch.",
      "content": "Use rope to hang the wind chime from a tree branch. If you want your wind chime to hang in a tree, simply loop a rope through one of the chain links and tie it onto a tree. Choose a relatively low-hanging horizontal branch. Ideally, one that has a small dip so the wind chime doesn’t slide along the branch. [6] X Research source To prevent rope friction from damaging the tree, use a bandana, sock, or other cloth to wrap the part of the rope that comes in contact with the tree. You can also use a tube of garden hose material as padding."
