      "content": "Gather two to three pillows on the bed, or use a body pillow . When trying to lie down while pregnant, pillows are your best friend. Before you get into bed, pile on the pillows and ask someone to help you position them for you so you can get comfortable. A long pillow, like a body pillow, is great for positioning against your back when you lie down on your side, or for you to hug when you sleep on your side.

Many stores also sell a long body pillow designed to also go between your legs to support your hips when you're pregnant."

      "title": "Avoid drinking water right before lying down.",
      "content": "Avoid drinking water right before lying down. Your doctor will likely recommend you drink lots of water during your pregnancy to stay hydrated. But avoid drinking a large glass of water before lying down or before bed, as this may cause you to wake up several times during the night to go to the bathroom. Stop drinking water 1 hour before you plan to lie down. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source As your pregnancy progresses, there will be added pressure on your bladder, meaning the less you drink before bed, the better. Avoid drinking anything caffeinated before going to bed, too. Caffeine isn't recommended when you're pregnant and it also makes it harder to sleep and could make you need to pee more often."

      "content": "Eat several hours before lying down. Many pregnant people suffer from heartburn, which can lead to discomfort and interrupted sleep. Prevent heartburn by skipping spicy meals a few hours before bed or before lying down. Wait at least 2 hours after eating to lie down and relax so you don’t develop heartburn. [3] X Research source If you start to feel heartburn once you lay down, use a pillow to prop your head up. Elevating your head can help your body to digest what you have eaten."

      "content": "Get into the lying position slowly and carefully. Sit on the bed, closer to the head of the bed than the foot of the bed. Move your body as far on to the bed as you can. Then, lower yourself down onto one side using your hands as support. Bend your knees slightly and pull them up onto the bed. Think of yourself as a rolling log, rolling on your side or on your back. Have your pillows ready on your bed so you can position them easily once you lie down."

      "content": "Try to lie on your left side. Lying on your left side, or the “left lateral position” will help with your blood circulation and ensures your baby gets a sufficient amount of nutrients and oxygen from the placenta. Doctors also recommend sleeping on your left side to help with insomnia or other sleep issues during pregnancy.

Hug a full length body pillow for extra comfort. Another option is to sleep on your left side in a 3/4 position. Lying on your left side, place your left arm slightly behind you and your left leg straight out and down, so you’re slightly turned toward your stomach. Bend your top leg and rest it on a pillow. Bend your upper arm and place a pillow behind your head."

Complications with lying on your right side are almost nonexistent, so it's fine to choose the right side if it's more comfortable. [9] X Research source Lay with your right arm underneath you and your right leg slightly bent to get comfortable. Experts used to believe that lying on your right side would constrict blood vessels to the uterus. However, new studies show that isn’t the case, and sleeping on your right side is very unlikely to cause any complications during pregnancy. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Lie on your back during the first few weeks of pregnancy only.",
      "content": "Lie on your back during the first few weeks of pregnancy only. Sleeping on your back is fine for the first few weeks of pregnancy, when your uterus has not yet expanded and will not exert any kind of pressure on the vena cava, which is the vein that carries blood back to your heart. But by your second trimester, avoid lying on your back as it can lead to nausea and dizziness, and it can also decrease oxygen transmission to the baby. To lie on your back comfortably during your first few weeks of pregnancy, place a pillow under your thighs and let your legs and feet roll open to the side. Roll one or both legs back and forth to release any tension in your lower back. Experts used to believe that sleeping on your back could increase the risk of a stillborn pregnancy. However, new studies have shown that this is very unlikely. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t sleep on your stomach after your first trimester. Many pregnant people are comfortable sleeping on their stomach during the first few weeks of their pregnancy, especially if they usually sleep on their stomach. But it can become uncomfortable once your uterus starts expanding and you begin to feel like you are carrying a large beach ball on your stomach. Sleep on your side or your back to stay comfortable while pregnant. [12] X Research source Keep in mind your baby could also experience discomfort while you sleep or lie down and might wake you up with a kick if they are feeling stressed due to your sleep position. If you wake up on your back or your stomach, simply roll over to your left or right side."
