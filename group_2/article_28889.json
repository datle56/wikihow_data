      "content": "Wrap a red cotton fabric around your head and mark the seam. Take your piece of fabric and wrap it around your head until it fits snugly. Now, while holding it snug, mark off a small vertical line where the 2 ends of the fabric overlap. [1] X Research source Purchase red cotton fabric from crafts stores—just make sure the color matches your skin suit! You can also use a red pillowcase or t-shirt. Cotton is the comfortable fabric choice, but don't be afraid to use a different kind. Just make sure you can tolerate it as mask material."

      "title": "Mark off a straight cutline down the fabric.",
      "content": "Mark off a straight cutline down the fabric. Using the overlap mark as a guide, draw a vertical line across the fabric where the 2 ends overlap. This is where you need to cut to remove the excess fabric. [2] X Research source Use a straight wooden ruler to guide your vertical line."

      "title": "Cut off the excess portion of fabric.",
      "content": "Cut off the excess portion of fabric. Use a pair of scissors to cut along the vertical line and remove the excess fabric. Use a ruler to guide your cutting if it makes things easier! [3] X Research source Never use scissors without the help of an adult."

    {
      "title": "Create 2 hems at each end of the fabric.",
      "content": "Create 2 hems at each end of the fabric. Use a glue gun to apply a small line of glue down one of the vertical portions of the fabric about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the edge. Now, fold the 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of fabric over the glue and press it down firmly for about a minute until it dries in place. [4] X Research source Repeat the above process for the other vertical edge of the fabric. Purchase a glue gun from a crafts or big-box store."

      "title": "Glue both of the hems together.",
      "content": "Glue both of the hems together. Lay the fabric onto a flat surface with both hems facing upward. Now, fold one side across half of the fabric so that the hem side faces downward. Apply a line of glue along the back of the hem and fold the opposing side across the fabric so that the front hem side touches the glue on the back of the other hem. Press down on them for about 1 minute until the glue dries. [5] X Research source After drying, your fabric should make a long sleeve."

      "title": "Pull the sleeve over your face and tie off the excess fabric.",
      "content": "Pull the sleeve over your face and tie off the excess fabric. After pulling the sleeve over your head, the fabric should fit tightly but comfortably around it. Grab the top of your head where the excess fabric extends and wrap an elastic band over it. [6] X Research source Fold the sides of the excess fabric underneath the top portion before you tie your elastic."

      "title": "Put your sleeve over a foam head and glue the excess fabric.",
      "content": "Put your sleeve over a foam head and glue the excess fabric. With the sleeve pulled over the head, remove the elastic and apply a line of glue underneath each of the folded side pieces. Now, press the side pieces down onto the glue and hold them in place for about 1 minute until the glue dries. [7] X Research source After this step, the excess fabric should be barely noticeable when looking at your mask from the front."

      "content": "Cut out 2 eye pieces from a plastic mask. Don't worry about the color—it's going to be covered with leather. Start by drawing from the bridge of the nose down to the just below the cheekbone. Now, draw from the temple down to the same point below the cheekbone. Bring your marker back up to the bridge of the nose and draw to the top of the forehead. Finally, draw from the temple—on a slight angle—up to the top of the forehead. Use a pair of scissors to cut off the eyepiece using your cutline as a guide. [8] X Research source Repeat this process for both eyepieces. Use a marker to create the eyepiece outline. For black face masks, use a white marker. If your face mask is white, use a black marker."

Start by drawing the triangles onto a piece of cardboard. Make sure each is about 5 inches (13 cm) tall and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide. Now, cut them out with a pair of scissors. [9] X Research source Adjust the measurements as you see fit—if you think taller triangles look cooler, go for it!"

      "content": "Glue the triangles onto the top of the eyeholes. Apply a thin horizontal line of glue directly above each eyehole. Now, press down the bottom of each triangle onto these lines. After gluing the triangles above the eyeholes, their tips should point about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) or more from the top of the eyepieces (not the eyeholes). [10] X Research source After applying the glue, hold the triangles onto the eyepieces with your thumbs for about 3 minutes."

Make sure each piece of leather extends 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) past the perimeter of the eyepiece. Start by placing the leather over the eyepieces and poking a hole in each eyehole using your precision knife. Then, cut out the leather that's inside the perimeter of the eyeholes so you'll be able to see through them. When you're finished, apply a small amount of glue around the outside perimeter of each eyehole and press down the excess leather over it. [11] X Research source Buy bicast leather (also known as PU leather) from crafts and fabric stores."

Apply small lines of glue onto the eyepieces underneath the remaining loose pieces of leather. Afterward, press the fabric down and hold it for 2 to 3 minutes until dry.

Now, apply a thin line of glue around the perimeter of the back side of the eyepieces. Press down any excess fabric you couldn't cut off over this glue. [13] X Research source After applying the excess fabric to the glue on the back of the eyepieces, place thin duct tape over them to hold them in place and help them dry."

Now, remove these portions with a pair of scissors. Don't worry if the holes are too big, as they will be behind the eyepieces. Use a pencil for outlines and markings so you don't ruin your mask!"

      "content": "Put on a red skin suit that doesn't cover your face. You can purchase a red skin suit from costume stores or online suppliers. Make sure it's the same (or similar) shade of red as your fabric. Try to find a suit with a thin material that is easy to draw on so your marker pops out. Swap out a red skin suit with red leggings and a red collared jacket if that's more comfortable. However, these might be harder to draw onto."

Don't worry about getting everything exact—just do your best! The most important parts are the shoulder guards and vertical chest guards along the sides of your ribs. Now, fill these outlines in using black paint. Either have a friend do this step while you wear your skin suit or lay down the suit onto a flat surface and do it yourself. Ideally, have a friend do it—painting your suit while it's on you will result in the best final product."

Remember that Deadpool's character is known to be able to use any weapon in the world. After buying your weapons from a toy store, attach them to your belt or place them between your belt and body. Any kind of ninja weapons, toy grenades, and guns pair well with the costume Try pairing your costume with kunai, which are small ninja knives."
