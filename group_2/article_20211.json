Ask to take care of your younger siblings while your parents are out, or volunteer to watch young cousins or the neighbor's kids. People who already trust you will be willing to help you your first babysitting experience [1] X Research source Talk to your parents about whether you should get paid for looking after your younger siblings or relatives. You might watch them for free the first few times, then ask for a low pay rate, like $7-$9 per hour. Once you start babysitting other families, you can ask for higher rates. Ask your first “customers” to be your references when you look for other babysitting jobs."

      "content": "Make flyers to advertise your services. Write “Babysitting Services” or “Need a Babysitter?” in big, bold lettering. Then, write a little about yourself, like, “I love taking care of kids of all ages. Responsible, loving, and lots of experience. Ask me for references!” Include your first name and phone number on the flyer or on tear-off strips at the bottom. Don't put your last name or address on your flyers."

They're often offered by local hospitals, YMCAs, or Red Cross branches. You probably won't have to use some of the more intense training, but it's good to know how to treat a scrape or do abdominal thrusts to help a child who's choking. [4] X Research source If you're trained in first aid and CPR, you'll be more likely to get hired and get a higher pay rate."

They might get into more specific questions, too, like how you'd respond if their kid was crying or throwing a fit. Using your prior experience, come up with some good answers to these kinds of questions so you come to the interview confident and prepared. [5] X Research source"

You want to make sure your expectations are in line before you both agree to the job. You could ask, for example, “Will I be cooking for Jimmy when you're out?” or “Will you need me to stay past 11 pm very often?”"

      "content": "Be honest about your availability. Tell them if you have sports practice, play rehearsals, or other activities on certain days of the week. Although it might feel awkward to do this in your very first meeting, it's important that they know what your schedule is before they start asking you to come over on days where you have prior commitments. [9] X Research source For example, you could say, “I want you to know upfront that I have soccer practices on Mondays and Wednesdays, so I probably won't be able to babysit on those days.”"

      "content": "Ask for a reasonable rate. If this is your first babysitting job, ask for $8-$10/hour. If you have references or extra qualifications, like CPR or first aid training, ask for a few dollars more. If you're taking care of multiple kids at once, you can also ask for a little more, around $10-$15 per hour. [10] X Research source You can base your rate on the area you live in. If you live in an expensive city, it's completely acceptable to charge higher rates. If people in your area typically have lower incomes, you'll likely need to charge less."
