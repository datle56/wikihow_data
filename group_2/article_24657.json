Friday ( Jumma ) is a special day in Islam and is mentioned several times in the Quran and the Sunnah for its importance and holiness. Share these quotes with your friends and family to remember and reflect on its significance. “O believers! When the call to prayer is made on Friday, then hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave off your business. That is best for you, if only you knew.” [Surah Al-Jumu'ah 62:9] It was narrated from Aws bin Aws that: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘One of the best of your days is Friday. On this day, Adam was created and on this day he died, on this day the Trumpet will be blown, and on this day all creatures will swoon. So send a great deal of salah upon me on this day, for your salah will be presented to me.’” [Sunan an-Nasa'i 1374] Narrated Abu Huraira: “The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ‘On every Friday the angels take their stand at every gate of the mosque to write the names of the people chronologically (i.e. according to the time of their arrival for the Friday prayer) and when the Imam sits (on the pulpit) they fold up their scrolls and get ready to listen to the sermon.’” [Sunan an-Nasa'i 1374] It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘This day is an ‘Eid (festival) which Allah has ordained for the Muslims. Whoever comes to Friday (prayer), let him take a bath and if he has perfume then let him put some on. And upon you (I urge to use) is the tooth stick.’” [Sunan Ibn Majah 1098] Aws bin Aws narrated: \"Allah's Messenger said to me: 'Whoever performs Ghusl on Friday, and bathes completely, and goes early, arriving early, gets close and listens and is silent, there will be for him in every step he take the reward of a year of fasting and standing (in prayer).'\" [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 496] Kathir bin Abdullah bin Amr bin Awf Al-Muzani narrated from his father, from his grandfather, that: “The Prophet said: ‘On Friday there is an hour in which the worshipper does not ask Allah for anything except that Allah grants it to him.’ They said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Which hour is it?’ He said: ‘When the prayer is begun until it is finished.’” [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 490] Abdullah bin Amr narrated that: “The Messenger of Allah said: ‘No Muslim dies on the day of Friday, nor the night of Friday, except that Allah protects him from the trials of the grave.’\" [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1074] It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘This day is an ‘Eid (festival) which Allah has ordained for the Muslims. Whoever comes to Friday (prayer), let him take a bath and if he has perfume then let him put some on. And upon you (I urge to use) is the tooth stick.’” [Sunan an-Nasa'i 1369] Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ‘Whoever recites Surat al-Kahf on Friday, a light will shine for him between this Friday and the next.’” [al-Sunan al-Kubrá lil-Bayhaqī 5996] Imam Shafe’e used to say: “I love to send plenty of salat upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) all the time and I love it more so on the day of Jumuah.” [Kitabul Umm 1/546]"
