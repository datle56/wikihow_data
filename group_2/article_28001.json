It will actually be easier to achieve a straight line looking straight ahead rather than turning your face to the side to see the full sideburn. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply shaving cream. Shaving cream is necessary because it provides hydration to your skin and lubrication during the shaving process. Use the shaving cream of your choice and lather up your sideburns. You can also lather up any other facial hair you may have if you plan to shave more than your sideburns. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Take a single stroke with the razor. Bring the razor to the top of one the sides of your sideburns. Then, bring the razor all the way down in one stroke. This will get rid of any bushiness, leaving your sideburn hair neat and trim. Repeat this on the other side of your sideburn. Then, repeat this again on the unshaven sideburn. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Make short strokes with the razor until the sideburns are straight. Once you’ve made single strokes down the sideburns, lather your sideburns again with shaving cream. Then, begin to make smaller strokes starting from the bottom of your sideburns. Take this time to even out the lines so that they are straight. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Expert Source Tiffany Carnevale-Russo Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 14 September 2021. When deciding on a length, consider your face shape. Longer sideburns are better on shorter faces because they make the face appear longer. Shorter sideburns are better for long faces for the opposite reason.

To help even the length of your sideburns out, imagine a line running across your face, reaching from the bottom, outer edge of each sideburn to the other. Keep this line in your imagination as you even out your sideburns. [8] X Expert Source Tiffany Carnevale-Russo Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 14 September 2021.

Pull it so that it reaches the bottom, outer edge of each sideburn. Make sure the thread is straight and taut. Take note of how much hair you need to take off of each sideburn to make them even.

      "content": "Use a trimmer with a guard. Your sideburns will inevitably need a touchup within a few days or a week, depending on how fast your hair grows. Always use an electric trimmer with a guard when dealing with growth and bushiness. A guard will prevent you from shaving off more than you intend to. Use a razor for straightening out lines."
