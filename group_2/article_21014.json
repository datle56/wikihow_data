      "content": "Always give honest compliments from the heart. Dating coach Louie Felix affirms that “honesty is always the best policy….I think it becomes disingenuous when you say it [a compliment] to try to impress someone. So make sure that everything that you're talking about is what you really think, what you really feel, what you really believe in.” Before giving a compliment, step back and take a moment to think about what you really admire about the other person. Don’t be tempted to give a compliment you don’t believe. For example, if your friend got a really unfortunate haircut, you don’t have to tell them you love it. Instead, ask them how they feel about it. Say something like, “The more important question is how do you feel about it?”"
