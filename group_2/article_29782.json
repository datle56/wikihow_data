      "content": "Paint a sturdy, 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) cardboard tube. Pick a tube that's sturdy, like the kind found in rolls of aluminum foil. Paint it using acrylic or tempera paints, then let it dry. [1] X Research source Consider making the tube look like a race car. Add a stripe, lightning bolt, and number! If you aren't good at painting, you can decorate the tube with duct tape or washi tape instead."

      "title": "Punch two holes at each end of the tube for the axles with a hole puncher.",
      "content": "Punch two holes at each end of the tube for the axles with a hole puncher. Make sure that the holes are level and straight across from each other. If you are having trouble making them even, wrap a rubber band vertically around the tube, then use the long, straight line as a guide. Be sure to take the rubber band off when you are done! [2] X Research source Don't poke the holes too close to the ends. About 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from each end would be ideal."

      "title": "Insert the dowels through the holes.",
      "content": "Insert the dowels through the holes. Slide the 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) dowel through the first set of holes, and the 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) dowel through the back. The shorter dowel will be the front of your car, and the longer dowel will be the back. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the holes, if needed.",
      "content": "Adjust the holes, if needed. The dowels should be able to spin freely inside the holes. If they don't, take the dowels out and make the holes a little bigger. When you are done, put the dowels back through the holes."

      "content": "Hot glue a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wooden spool to the back of each CD. Draw a line of hot glue around the clear, plastic circle at the center of a CD. Quickly press the top of the wooden spool into it. Make sure that it is centered. Repeat this step for the other three CDs. [4] X Research source You can use old, scratched up CDs or blank ones. Hot glue sets up quickly, so work one spool and CD at a time."

      "title": "Hot glue a button to the front of each CD.",
      "content": "Hot glue a button to the front of each CD. The button needs to be big enough to cover the hole in the middle of the CD. Use a standard 2- or 4-hole button, not a shank button with a loop on the end. The button will cover the hole and keep the wheels in place. [5] X Research source If you can't find any buttons, cut circles out of thin cardboard, and use those instead."

      "title": "Wrap some rubber bands around the wheels.",
      "content": "Wrap some rubber bands around the wheels. Slide two rubber bands onto your first wheel so that they make an X shape on the front. Repeat this step for the other three wheels. This will give your wheels some traction. [6] X Research source The rubber bands should be wrapped tightly around the wheels. You may need to wrap them more than once."

Make sure that the cardboard tube is centered, then measure the gap between the spool and the cardboard tube. Cut a straw down to fit those measurements. You will need four pieces total. [7] X Research source Your first/front set of straws should be about 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long. Your second/back set of straws should be about 2Â¼-inch (5.71-centimeter) long. You can use plastic or paper straws. Consider using a color that matches your car."

Place the short stoppers onto the short dowel, and the long stoppers onto the long dowel. Place the wheels back onto the dowels and test the fit. If the stoppers are too long, take everything off and trim them down again."

Place the wheels back onto the axles, and let the glue dry. [8] X Research source The wheels should fit snugly onto the axles. If they are too loose, wrap some masking tape around the end of the dowel to thicken it."
