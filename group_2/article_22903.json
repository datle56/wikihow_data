Sit down with your partner or any other adults in the home who are involved in childcare. Explain that you want to come up with a few house rules for the kids to follow. Have a conversation about what you want to accomplish, which rules you all think are most important, and how you plan to enforce your rules.

If you’re coming up with rules for little kids, decide on the 2-3 most important rules you want to enforce and start with that. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source As your child gets older, gradually increase the number of rules you expect them to follow. Wait for them to master all the current rules before you add more. For example, you might start with a list like, “Say ‘please’ when you ask for something,” “Ask Mommy or Daddy before going outside,” and “Wash your hands before you eat.”"

      "content": "Write down your list of rules using clear, simple language. Once you’ve come up with a few basic rules, write them down. This will help everyone remember what they are. Keep your language clear and simple so that the rules are easy for the whole family to understand. [4] X Research source For example, you might write something like, “Finish doing all your homework assignments for the day before playing video games. Then you can play for 30 minutes.” Avoid vague language, like “Behave yourself” or “Be good.” Set specific, clear rules so that your children can understand exactly what you expect of them. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source As much as possible, phrase your rules in a positive way. For example, instead of saying “Don’t leave a mess at the table,” say “Do clear away your dishes after you eat.”"

Write your rules down on a big piece of poster board or a whiteboard and hang them up in an obvious place, like on the fridge or the living room wall. That way, everyone in the house can review them at any time. [6] X Research source If the rules are posted for everyone to see, it’s less likely that your kids will try to argue about them. You can always point to the list! [7] X Research source If your kids aren’t reading yet, draw pictures to help illustrate the rules, or ask them to do it. For example, if one of your rules is “Put away your toys when you’re done with them,” draw a picture of your child putting their toys in a toybox."

Every few months, sit down with any other adults in the household and talk to them about how well the rules are working. If you’re having trouble enforcing a particular rule, brainstorm some possible solutions. For example: [8] X Research source You might need to change the consequences for not following a particular rule, or make sure that everyone is enforcing them consistently. As your children get older, you might need to change or update rules to reflect their changing needs and abilities. [9] X Research source If you think your children are having trouble understanding the rules, look into redefining them or finding ways to explain them more clearly."

      "title": "Come up with clear consequences if your house rules are broken.",
      "content": "Come up with clear consequences if your house rules are broken. It’s natural for kids to challenge the rules and try to push their boundaries as they grow. To ensure that your children follow the rules and understand their importance, set specific consequences for when those rules are broken. For instance, if your child refuses to brush their teeth every morning and evening, the consequence might be that they can’t have sweets until they start caring for their teeth again. Try to keep the consequences relevant to the rule, and don’t set any consequences you aren’t prepared to enforce! For example, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to say you’ll get rid of all your child’s toys if they don’t eat their vegetables. Try something more relevant and less drastic, like “You can only have some ice cream if you eat all your broccoli.”"

Don’t wait for your child to break an unspoken rule and then unexpectedly spring a consequence on them. This will leave your child feeling confused and upset. Sit down with your child and explain the rules and consequences clearly before you start enforcing them. For example, you might say, “Okay, we’re getting you a new toy, but you have to share it with your sister. If you grab it away from her or don’t let her have a turn, we will put it away for 10 minutes until you are ready to play nicely.” [10] X Research source Younger children might need frequent reminders about the rules. Try to give these reminders before entering a situation where you’ll need to enforce them. For example, “We’re going to the playground. Remember, if you throw sand at other kids in the sandbox, we’ll have to leave!” [11] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source"

[12] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source For example, maybe you told your 4-year-old that they’d have to leave the playground if they threw sand. The moment you see your child throwing sand, tell them it’s time to go and remove them from the playground. Explain that you’re leaving because they broke the rule. It’s not enough for just one person in the family to be consistent with the rules. Ask everyone in the family to enforce them the same way. For example, if you enforce a rule but your partner doesn’t, your child might only follow the rule when you’re around."

      "content": "Praise and reward your kids for following the rules. Consequences don’t always have to be negative. Your kids will have an easier time following the rules (and will enjoy it a lot more!) if they get rewards and positive feedback for good behavior. With lots of positive reinforcement, they’ll also be encouraged to make better choices without having to be reminded. A reward could be anything from a hug or a high five to a special treat, like going out for ice cream. [13] X Research source For example, if they put away their toys without being asked, reinforce your child’s behavior by giving them a high five and saying something like, “Wow, that was awesome how you picked up after yourself! That was super responsible of you, I’m so proud!” You can also try setting consistent rewards for following the rules. For example, you might agree to take your child out for ice cream at the end of the week if they do all their homework every night."

      "content": "Set a good example by following your own rules. Kids have a strong sense of what’s fair. If they see you breaking the house rules, they’ll feel resentful and be less likely to follow the rules themselves. If you set rules for the family, reinforce them by following any rules that apply to you. [14] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source For example, if there’s a rule that everyone says “Please” when asking for something, always say “Please” when you make a request of your kids.

Keep this in mind, and try to set rules that you know your child will be able to follow. You can modify the rules or introduce new ones as your child grows. For example: [15] X Research source Keep rules simple and specific for preschoolers, and remember that you’ll probably have to help them follow the rules. For instance, you might set a rule that they can’t cross the street on their own, but you’ll still need to supervise them around streets. As your child gets older, set rules that will require them to take more responsibility. For instance, while you’ll probably need to help your preschooler with their daily hygiene, you can set an expectation for an older child that they’ll brush their teeth, wash their hands, or take baths on their own."

Depending on your child’s age and abilities, you might set rules like: Put away your toys after you use them. Clear your dishes off the table when you’re done eating. Take out the trash in your room. Feed and care for your pets every day (e.g., take the dog for a walk, change the paper in the bird’s cage, or change the water in the fish tank). Help cook dinner for the family once a week."

You can also keep your kids healthy with rules related to diet, hygiene, and basic self-care. This might include rules like “Always brush your teeth before bed” or “Eat at least one vegetable with every meal.”"

These rules might include daily time limits on screen time, rules about how your children can earn screen time (e.g., by completing homework or chores), or limits on what your children can watch, play, or do online. [20] X Research source Your rules can also limit when and where your kids can have access to screen time (e.g., no screens at the dinner table or within half an hour of bedtime). For instance, if your child has access to a tablet, you might make it a rule that they get your permission before downloading a new app. As your kids get older, you may need to set rules to help them stay safe online , such as never giving out personal information to strangers on social media. When your kids are younger, you can use parental control apps to help reinforce a lot of these rules. You might make a \"no device\" rule for certain places, like restaurants.
