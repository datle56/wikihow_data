      "content": "Eye contact can create a connection and signal that you want to kiss. The eyes are the window to the soul, and there’s nothing sexier than locking eyes with a slight smile on your face. Once you lock eyes, lean towards your partner, take their hand in yours, or brush their hair away from their face as you initiate the kiss. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Move in slowly at an angle so your noses don’t touch. You don’t need to tilt your head very much, so don’t turn your head super far. Begin to lean in towards your partner. Go slowly to build the passion up and raise the tensions between you and your partner. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Slowly start closing your eyes as your lips are about to touch. Pucker your lips out a bit and slowly close your eyes so that they shut right when your lips touch. Keep your lips soft and don’t push too hard against your partner. [3] X Research source Take cues from your partner here. If they open their mouth a bit, open your mouth, too! [4] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. If they pull away a bit as soon as you lock lips, they probably aren’t in the mood for some passionate kissing, so don’t force it."

      "content": "A quick peck isn’t super passionate, so don’t pull away. A key part of a passionate kiss is the length. Give the two of you enough time to enjoy the experience. Kissing is all about connection, and a slightly longer kiss signals an especially intense bond. [5] X Research source If your kiss is too short, it will feel like more of a quick smooch.

      "title": "The closer you two are, the more intimate the kiss will be.",
      "content": "The closer you two are, the more intimate the kiss will be. Put one hand on their back and gently close in. If your partner is shorter than you, you can put a hand over their shoulder instead and lean in that way. Bringing your bodies together signals that you’re so into them that you just can’t stand not being close! You can pull them against you before you actually start kissing if you want a more sexually charged energy. If they pull away or reposition themselves so that there’s a little bit of space against you, don’t force it. Let them respond to what you’re doing so that they’re comfortable, too!"

      "content": "This will heighten the emotional energy of your kiss. Incorporating both of your arms is essential to making your partner feel like you just can’t control your impulse to be close to them. You can use your free arm to support your partner’s head by resting your palm against the cheek, or against the back of their head. Alternatively, you can put your hand on their upper back or shoulder. Just do what feels natural! [7] X Research source You can also put your hand on their upper chest if you two are kissing at a slight angle. If your partner is kind of swept off of their feet and surprised, they may not put both of their hands on you. If one of their hands is free, you might hold it tight."

      "content": "Staying in one position can make a kiss feel too stiff and cold. However, if you move your hands too quickly, it can make it difficult for your partner to settle into the kiss. Calmly reposition your hands so that you engage all of your partner’s senses. [8] X Research source You could run your fingers through their hair a bit and give them a (very gentle) hair tug for a super hot option. For something cuter, you might brush their hair back out of their face. Holding a hand against their check or gently squeezing their shoulder can make them feel supported and close to you. You can also move both of your hands to their lower back and pull them up closer to you. This is an especially sexy option if your partner is shorter than you."

      "title": "Listening to your partner’s body language is key.",
      "content": "Listening to your partner’s body language is key. If they lean in even further when you embrace them, it’s a cue that they’re super in for a potential make out session. If they coo a little bit but don’t lean in, keep doing what you’re doing! If they pull back after a few seconds, they probably don’t want to keep going so it may be time to wind down. [9] X Research source It can be hard to remember if you’re super into your partner in the moment, but passion requires two people! Don’t push them to do something they aren’t enjoying."

      "content": "Introducing your tongue will turn the heat up a notch. A passionate French kiss is a super intimate way of moving from romantic to hot. If your partner opens their mouth a bit and they seem into it, start moving your tongue around in their mouth. Explore gently and softly.

      "content": "Pausing a French kiss for a little lip play can be super hot. If you’ve been kissing for more than 5-10 seconds, variation can keep things hot and heavy. When the position feels natural, move your lips down a bit so that their bottom lip is in the middle of your lips and give it a very gentle pull. Release their lip after a second or so and go back to your normal kissing. [14] X Research source This may be a bit of an odd sensation for them (in a good way) if they’ve never done this before, so don’t suck hard like you’re pulling on a straw. If you have done this before and things are trending way more to the sexy side than the romantic side, gentle, extremely light bite may really get your partner going!"

      "content": "Less is more with noise-making, but a soft moan can drive them crazy. You don’t want to be super loud during a kiss or you may throw your partner out of the moment. However, a very quiet moan or cooing noise during an especially intense part of the kiss can really elevate the moment. [15] X Research source This is definitely one of those moves you probably only want to pull out once during an extended kiss."

      "content": "Give the kissing session a little bit of room to breathe (literally). There’s a thin line between a passionate, extended kiss, and overwhelming your partner. Pause in between multiple kisses for a second or so just so you and your partner can actually get a breath. [16] X Research source This also gives you a brief moment to assess whether your partner wants to keep going or not. If you pause to breathe and they pull back like they’re done, the kiss is probably over."

      "content": "You could say something sweet to make the hair on their neck stand up. Leave them with something to think about by whispering something sexy or romantic into their ear as you’re pulling away from one another. You might let them know how much they mean to you, or say something a little suggestive to drive them wild. Either way, it will punctuate the kiss and drive them wild. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You might say: “You drive me crazy, you know that?” “You’re the light of my life.” “You have no idea how bad I want you.” Less is more here.
