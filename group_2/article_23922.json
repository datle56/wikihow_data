[4] X Research source In addition to a standard partition for your Linux installation and file system, Linux also uses swap space when your memory gets full. The amount of swap space you need depends on how much RAM your computer has. If you have less than 2GB of RAM, it is recommended you allocate double the amount of RAM you have for your swap space. If you have between 2 - 8 GB of RAM, you can allocate swap space that is equal to the amount of RAM you have. If you have greater than 8 GB of RAM, it is recommended you allocate a minimum of 4GB of RAM for swap space."
