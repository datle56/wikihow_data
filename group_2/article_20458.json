      "content": "Plan to marry someone whose personal values are compatible with yours. Your values are things like your views on family, money, faith, and how you treat others. If you see eye-to-eye on these types of things, it's going to be a lot easier for the two of you to be on the same page as you build a life together. [1] X Research source Sometimes, marriage can work when you have opposing values, but it will take a lot more compromise and cooperation, and those issues may potentially be a source of conflict later on. For instance, if you believe it's important to raise your children in church but your boyfriend hates organized religion, you may find yourself arguing about that if you have children together one day. Talk about the future in a way that always includes him. [2] X Expert Source Cristina Morara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

      "content": "Take your time getting to know his views on marriage. Marriage is a big step, and just because you're excited about it, it doesn't necessarily mean your guy is. As you get to know each other better, ask him questions that might show what he thinks about the concept of marriage in general. If he's not ready to get married, there's probably not anything you can do to change his mind. [3] X Research source For instance, if he opens up about past relationships, watch for signs of anything in his history that might make him afraid of commitment. If he has been hurt before, he might need extra time before he can open his heart enough to consider marriage. He might also say things like, \"Marriage is just a piece of paper,\" which might indicate that he has no intention of getting married. You want to take the time to create a solid foundation with this man in your relationship. [4] X Expert Source Cristina Morara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

In turn, if he's the right man for you to marry, you should also feel that you're able to trust him. That kind of trust requires being open and honest with each other. Don't lie to him, and don't tolerate dishonesty from him, either. [5] X Research source Honest and consistent communication makes it clear you're committed to him.

If things do get out of hand and an argument ensues, apologize for the things you said or did that contributed. That way, he'll be able to see that the two of you can overcome anything together in a mature way, which may help ease any fears he has over being married. [7] X Research source During an argument, try to express your feelings without resorting to name-calling or losing your temper. Ask him to treat you with the same respect, as well. Don't let anyone manipulate you into taking all the blame for a disagreement. In almost every case, both of you will have contributed to the situation."

Frequently tell him how much you love him and how much he means to you, and give him specific compliments on the qualities and features you love most about him. [8] X Research source For instance, you might say things like, \"You're such a hard worker, and I really respect that about you,\" or \"I love your smile!\" If he's feeling nervous about a job interview, you might say, \"You're so smart and you're more than qualified for the position.

In a strong and healthy marriage, you'll need to encourage each other, solve problems together, and uplift one another when times get really hard. By showing him that he can rely on you, he may feel more inclined to spend the rest of his life with you. [9] X Research source For instance, if he's feeling sad because someone in his family passed away, you might just sit quietly with him, holding his hand. Don't pressure him to talkâ€”he will if he wants to. If he's feeling stressed about work, you might prepare a nice meal for him or take him out somewhere out for dinner so he can unwind."

For instance, if he grabs you, pushes you, or screams at you during an argument, that type of behavior is likely to escalate in the future. [10] X Research source Other red flags might include trying to keep you away from your family and friends, putting you down or making you feel bad about yourself, blaming you for his actions, or insisting that he take control of both of your finances."

Not only will that help you feel more fulfilled and self-confident, but it will make your relationship stronger. Having a little time apart allows you to miss each other, and you'll have more to talk about when you do see each other! For instance, you might go for a bike ride with your best friend while he's watching a football game with his buddies. Of course, if you have the same interests, feel free to enjoy them together!

[11] X Research source Self-care might be something physical like relaxing in a bubble bath while you deep condition your hair, but it could also mean anything that makes you feel mentally, spiritually, or emotionally healthy, like practicing yoga or meditation, going for a long, quiet walk, or writing in your journal."

I'm worthy of being loved.\" If you're struggling with your self-confidence because you haven't been proposed to, you might remind yourself of the good things your guy has done for you.

For instance, you might talk about where you'd like to live, whether or not you'd like to have children, or what type of career you'd like to eventually have. Casually mention him as part of the plans, then pay attention to his reaction. For example, you might say something like, \"I'd love for us to take a trip to Europe together one day.\" That will let him know he's included in your dreams. If he says something like, \"I'd really love that!\" then he may be thinking of a future together, too. If his answer is non-committal, like \"Yeah, maybe,\" he may not be as invested as you are."

If you really want him to know that you're hoping to be engaged soon, pick up a magazine or catalog featuring engagement rings. Then, casually browse through it when he's around, and show him a few of the ones you really love. Not only will this let him know you're thinking of marriage, but it will help him know what your tastes are. For instance, he might be imagining a classic ring with a large diamond, while you might prefer a non-traditional gemstone or an unusual design. Try not to show him rings that are way out of his price range. If he thinks your tastes are more expensive than he can meet, he might be hesitant to buy a ring at all. If you'd prefer not to have a ring at all, you can tell him that instead of showing him rings. It will still let him know you're thinking about marriage."

It's up to you whether you get down on one knee or offer a ring, but do make it clear that you're asking him to marry you. [16] X Research source Try to think of a way to make the proposal special and personal, like taking him to the place where you had your first date or a spot with a really romantic view. Once you're there, tell him how much he means to you, then ask him if he'll be yours forever!"
