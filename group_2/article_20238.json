      "content": "Meet new guys by trying out new activities, accepting invites, and getting out of the house. Before you get a boyfriend, you'll have to meet some guys. Don't worry, it isn't as scary as you think. You can try to get into a relationship with a guy you already know if they are decent, or you can go out and meet some new guys. Check if he has qualities you like in a relationship. This is easy and fun to do, so don't be nervous! Make sure when you're meeting new guys you don't come across as fake. Join a club, community class, or activity group. You can play a sport you like, take an art class at your local community center, or join a study group. Find something that appeals to you and you will instantly be meeting people that you have something in common with so you have something to talk about. Go out to clubs (adult or all-ages clubs, depending on what you prefer) and start talking with new people there. Just be careful and practice common sense. [1] X Research source Find a group on the Internet that appeals to you. This can be a fan forum for a show or activity you like or maybe a multiplayer video game that you find fun. However, make sure you don't share your personal details online with anyone you don't know."

      "content": "Try out a dating app . Dating apps give you a chance to meet guys who are outside of your normal social circle. Set up a profile with quality photos, add a few fun facts about yourself, and don’t be afraid to be honest about what you’re looking for. Once you match with someone, keep your messages fun and light. Here are a few ideas to get a conversation started: Ask for a recommendation: “Hey, what do you think is the best coffee shop around here?” Bring up something from his profile: “Your dog is adorable. How old is he?” Find out what he likes to do in his free time: “Are you up to anything fun this weekend?” Start up a playful debate: “Thoughts on putting pineapple on pizza?”"

Try to gauge if he meets your minimum requirements for someone to date. Is he funny? Smart? Nice? Decide what is important to you and gauge these things during your initial conversation. If he seems totally different than what you're looking for, it's not worth it just because he's hot. If you met him online and something about him instinctively rubs you in a wrong way, or his profile and pictures seem too good to be true, think of your safety and don't meet him in person.

Take an interest in him as a person and show him who you are too. Show him the best parts of who you are! Let him get to know you. Have your limits (a guy worth dating will be okay with that), but don't be afraid to try new things. Does he listen to a band you've never heard of, or never bothered to listen to? Give it a try, you might like them! If you put forth the effort and create a genuine opinion, even if it (respectfully) differs from his, it can at least give you something to talk about."

You may try to wait it out, but only if you're okay with just ending up his friend if it doesn't work out. It can be hard to get information like this without simply asking him.

You can certainly tell him when you don't like something he does, but don't be mean or controlling about it and help him find a good way to change. If his grades are low and he struggles in school, set up a time to spend together studying and tutor him in subjects where you do better than he does.

If he has trouble holding down or finding a job, help him by showing the importance of good work habits or helping him look for a job. Offer to go with him to workshops for writing or building resumes, talk with him about ways that he could learn to enjoy work more, or help him find a job that he would be more interested in going to every day.
