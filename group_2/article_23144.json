      "content": "Yes, this feeling is super common—you’re not alone. Some people think of college as the best phase of their life, but that’s not true for everyone. If it feels like all of your friends and peers are having a perfect college experience, think again. The way you’re feeling is totally normal, and in fact, college students today are more stressed than ever. Whether it’s academic pressure or the college lifestyle that’s the cause, you’re not alone. At the end of the day, we’re all different. No one period, place, or lifestyle will suit everyone. So if you’ve heard that old phrase (“These are the best days of your life…”), know that objectively, that won’t be true for everyone. And that’s okay!"

      "content": "Know your \"why.\" Knowing \"why\" you're doing something helps you get through those moments when you feel like giving up. If aren't sure what your reason is, ask yourself \"What am I doing this for, anyway?\" For many, their \"why\" has to do with the value of a college degree, since any degree, certification, or skill is going to make you more valuable in the long run. Consider your personal values to figure out your \"why,\" and live in line with those values! For some people, the \"why\" is financial—they pick a career path for the security that it provides in the future. Others choose their path based on what they're good at or what they feel will allow them to contribute the most."

      "content": "Choose a major that makes you happy or fulfilled. If you chose a major that you don’t connect with or feel is propelling your life forward, that could leave you feeling empty. Reflect on your course of study, and make sure that it either lines up with your interests or long-term goals. Ask yourself: where do I want to be in five years? Or, what do I love to learn about right now? Then, match your major to your self-discoveries . Reflect and see if the reason you hate college is because you're doing what your parents or other people think you should in the future, rather than listening to yourself. If you have a specific career goal in mind, what do you need to study to get there? Learn more through research or talk to someone in the field. On the other hand, you don’t need to figure your future out now. Does your heart soar when you read Russian literature? You can’t go wrong following your passions! You may feel pressure around this choice, but as long as you believe in your studies (as a means to expand your mind or a tool to get your from A to B) you’ll be just fine. If you choose a major that not only aligns with your professional and personal goals, but also aligns with your talents and strengths, your experience will be vastly more pleasant. It will always be something that's going to be more interesting to you as you're studying. Remember, though—you're still in a transitional phase where you are becoming independent. Give yourself leeway around needing to know exactly what you want to do with your life. All you need is a rough draft, as you can always change your course in the future! The idea that choosing the wrong path at 20 years old will determine the rest of your life isn't true. It's only true if you believe that your education stops when you finish college or that you can't recreate yourself any time you want."

At the end of the day, no degree is worth as much as your wellbeing. If you don’t feel like you can wait to reflect on the decision, that’s okay. Plus, your school probably offers leaves of absence, too. Reach out to your advisor for more help—this might be the perfect solution for you."
