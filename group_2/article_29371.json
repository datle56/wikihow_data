      "content": "Use a comfortable, full-coverage bra for this project. Full-coverage bras are usually wireless, made of breathable fabric, and have full cups that cover the entirety of your breasts. Try on the bra to make sure the neckline fits close against your skin and the cups can support the size and weight of your prosthesis. [1] X Research source Avoid tight-fitting bras and sports bras. Compressing scar tissue is uncomfortable and may prevent lymph fluids from draining properly. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Choose a bra with minimal padding for the best fit. If you’re having trouble finding a bra that fits properly after your mastectomy, just know that this is pretty common and you aren't alone. Try booking an appointment with an experienced bra fitter to help you out. They can take exact measurements, offer advice, and help you select the best post-surgery bra for you.

      "content": "Put a sheet of paper on a flat surface and lay a foam breast form on top. A regular piece of white printer paper works fine for this. Place it on a flat table or ironing board and position a foam breast form in the center. If your prosthesis is made of foam or fiber fill, it's totally fine to use it for this since foam is durable. [4] X Research source Don't use a silicone prosthesis for this part, though! The pins can damage it. If you had a mastectomy without immediate reconstructive surgery, your nurse probably sent you home with a temporary foam insert. You can use that for this. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a foam breast form, stuff the bra cup with fiber fill in the next step. Fill up the cup completely! You can buy fiber fill at craft stores."

Shape and adjust the cup with your hands until the foam fills up the cup properly. Smooth out the bra with your hand so the cup seams are resting flat against the paper. [6] X Research source You can tape the bra to the paper if you’re worried it might shift around as you’re pinning the bra. [7] X Research source"

Be sure to stick each pin through both the fabric and paper. Pin along the center front of the cup, between the strap and underarm, and finish with the neckline edge. [8] X Research source If the neckline has lace, stick the pins near the outer edge of the lace. Don’t pin the underarm seam! Leave that part of the cup open and unpinned."

Grab a pencil or pen and lightly sketch a line to connect the pin holes. The outline doesn’t have to be perfect, so don’t sweat it! Just connect the dots.

Using the edge of the form as reference, sketch a straight line from the underarm to bottom seam line. The line should skim the outer edge of the form. [10] X Research source This line closes the gap in the pattern. Remove the form when you’re done. If you used fiber fill instead of a foam form, ditch the fill and use your silicone prosthesis for this since no pins are involved."

This is enough for 1 bra pocket. If you had a double mastectomy, use the pattern to cut a second piece of fabric for the other bra cup. [16] X Research source The semi-circular edge of fabric goes on the outer edge of each bra cup. For the right breast, the semi-circle will form a “C” shape. For the left breast, it will be an inverted “C.” Labeling the left and right cups now might prevent confusion later on. [17] X Research source"

Trim the thread and repeat the process on the other side if you’re doing both bra cups. Then, pop in the form(s) and try on your new bra! Your bra should be comfortable and your breasts should look balanced. If your breasts look uneven, adjust the bra straps or change the position of the insert(s) until you're happy with the way everything looks. If you’re not happy with the pocket position, use a seam ripper to remove the stitches, readjust the pocket, and sew it back into your bra cup. If the fit is too tight, remove the stitches and sew it into your bra again using a looser stitch."
