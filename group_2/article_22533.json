      "content": "Capris and other short pants tend to make your legs look thicker. Instead, slip on a pair of long jeans or slacks, which lengthen your frame while disguising your thighs. [1] X Research source High-waisted pants are another great option. [2] X Research source If you can, stay away from skinny jeans, as well as pants with side pockets. These tend to bring more attention to your hips and thighs. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "These pants don’t highlight your hips. Instead, boot-cut pants create a smooth, even look all the way down your legs, from your hips to your ankles. If you don’t have any boot-cut pants lying around, that’s okay! Flared pants can also slim down your hips. [4] X Research source You might slip into a pair of boot-cut jeans for a night out, or get ready for work in a pair of flared slacks or trousers."

      "content": "Mix and match bright tops with dark bottoms. Look through your closet for any bright, colorful, or patterned tops—the more eye-catching your shirt is, the better. Then, slip on a dark skirt or pair of pants, which help emphasize your top. This way, your upper body will be the focus of your outfit and it will visually balance out your proportions. [5] X Research source For example, you might pair an animal-printed blouse or dress shirt with a pair of black slacks."

      "content": "A-Line cuts help your legs look slimmer. [7] X Research source Unlike other dresses and tops, A-Line cuts fit comfortably around your waistline and flow down in a triangular shape. [8] X Research source Both A-Line tops and dresses are great ways to draw the eye upward while helping slim your legs down. [9] X Research source If you have the option, choose a dress with a flowy fabric instead of a skintight one. Flowy fabrics don’t draw as much attention to your hips and thighs."

      "content": "Unique necklines switch up the focus of your outfit. Search through your wardrobe for a shirt or dress with a fun neckline, like an off-the-shoulder, asymmetrical, or cowl neck. This way, the eye won’t be naturally drawn to your hips or thighs. [10] X Research source For example, you might pair an off-the-shoulder top with a pair of high-waisted pants for a chic look."

      "content": "Shoulder pads help highlight your upper body. Look for a dress shirt, blazer, or other garment with plenty of padding over your shoulders—this will balance out your hips. If you don’t have any padded tops, take some shirts or jackets to your tailor to get some padding added in. [11] X Research source You might slip on a padded blazer before heading to work, or grab a padded top for a casual afternoon out."

      "content": "A cinched belt helps bring attention to your waistline. Slip into your favorite top or dress. Then, loop and secure the belt to really define your waistline. [12] X Research source This look works best with shorter tops that end around the middle of your hips. Any kind of belt will work for this. Sources don’t specifically recommend wearing thin or thick belts. [13] X Research source"

Dig through your wardrobe and look for any decorative scarves, chunky necklaces, bold earrings, or other accessories that will make your chest and neck area the center of attention. [14] X Research source For example, a short, chunky necklace will draw a lot of attention to your neckline, and not as much to your hips and thighs."
