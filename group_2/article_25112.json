Males have a mixture of whitish dots on the upper abdomen, are typically about half the size of female spiders, and are not as dangerous as the female.

By learning a bit about the webs of the particular kinds of spiders you're looking out for (or the lack thereof) you can prepare your plan of attack for undesirable spiders. [3] X Research source Black widow webs are usually irregularly shaped and somewhat thicker than other spider's webs, and usually located within one foot of the ground. The webs of black widows are typically in dry corners and other safe areas, not out in the open and easy to find, and usually look somewhat erratic, with a tunneling feature where the spider hides during the day. Brown recluse webs are loose and sticky, with an off-white color. You won't see them strung between tree branches or in the corner of the house, but in \"reclusive\" spots like under boxes, in woodpiles, or other unused out of the way areas. Large and intricate webs are the hallmark of the harmless orb-weaver spider, a helpful bug-catcher. Leave these spiders alone, or gently migrate them elsewhere."

If you've got a large brownish hairy spider building a conspicuous web in the middle of the day, you probably don't need to worry. If you're worried you've got a dangerous spider, check the webs in the middle of the day when the spider will be dormant. At this point, you can either lay out liquid or powder insecticide, or you can come back at night to kill them directly if you want to be sure."

Use a magazine or newspaper large enough to cover the bowl to keep the spider from escaping prematurely, and then release it outside, far from your house if you wish. If you want to kill the spider without smashing it, you can fill your bowl or pan with insecticide, killing the spider as you capture it. You could also spray the spider at this point with insecticide or hairspray. Only do this if the spider is harmful."

It may be inelegant, but at least you'll be sure you've got it. Black widows might have a tendency to head toward you if you miss, so be quick and keep your distance from dangerous spiders.
