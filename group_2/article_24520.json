Venmo scams come in all shapes and sizes—from listings on Facebook Marketplace to romance scams, criminals have come up with all sorts of ways to hack, lie, and steal their way into your bank account.

When it comes to the internet (especially apps and services that contain your financial info), the less info you have on display, the better. That said, Venmo has security measures to help keep your account more secure, like a built-in 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) system that forces you to verify your login through an additional measure, like receiving a code over text.
