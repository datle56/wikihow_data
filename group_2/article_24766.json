When you’re ready to enjoy one of your donuts, here’s a good trick: place the donut on a plate and microwave it for a few seconds. This will soften, warm, and put moisture back into the donut—yum! [5] X Research source Since your donuts are still at room temperature, be careful not to go crazy with the microwave. If you microwave them too much, any icing or glaze on the donuts will melt, and the donuts might actually become harder. [6] X Research source"
