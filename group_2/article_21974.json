      "content": "Yes, regular pruning promotes growth. If you notice that your plant is getting a little too bushy, go ahead and cut it back about 2/3 of the way using sharp scissors or hand pruners. Try to keep around 1 to 3 in (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of growth above the soil to keep the plant healthy. Oregano is a fairly hearty plant, so as long as you leave at least 1/3 of it intact, it’s going to be fine. [7] X Research source"

Then, spread the leaves on a paper towel in a single layer. Place the leaves in the oven, but keep the oven turned off, and leave them there overnight. When the leaves are dry and crumbly, transfer them to an airtight container.
