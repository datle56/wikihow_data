A bite from a black widow is often immediately painful and can be distinguished from other spider and insect bites by the two puncture marks it makes on the skin. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Although it may be painless, usually a black widow bite is at least moderately painful because the spider has long, sharp fangs. The two-fanged puncture wound then starts to turn red, become inflamed and form a nodule. Tenderness at the bite site tends to increase and spread out within an hour."

      "content": "Look for a \"bull's eye\" bite wound. A bite from a brown recluse spider is usually painless or causes a mild stinging sensation similar to a mosquito bite. Within about 30 – 60 minutes however, the bite area becomes red and inflamed with a central sore called a \"bull’s eye\" lesion. [5] X Research source Redness and intense pain develop within eight hours as the central sore becomes larger, fills with blood, ruptures and then leaves a very tender ulcer. During this stage, a deep blue or purple area often forms around the bite, usually with a red ring around it. Medical attention is usually only needed if an ulcer forms and lasts for more than a few weeks.

Although tarantulas are arguably some of the most scary looking spiders, the types native to North and South America are not venomous and rarely ever bite. [7] X Research source However, these \"New World\" tarantulas do throw or eject needle-like black hairs when agitated or threatened. Note that tarantula species native to Africa and the Middle East lack needle-like hairs, but they are more aggressive and produce venom."

      "title": "Identify other spider bites.",
      "content": "Identify other spider bites. The bites from black widow and brown recluse spiders are most identifiable, mostly due to the fact that they have the most potent venom and typically cause the most symptoms. [8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source However, other spider bites are more common and can lead to pain and swelling also. For example, the Hobo is a large, fast-running spider with yellow markings on its brown back. They inject neurotoxic venom when they bite people that can cause some surrounding skin to die, but not nearly to the extent that brown recluse venom does. Bites from Hobo and Sac spiders cause discomfort and wounds that mimic a bee or wasp sting, although the initial pain is much less because the fangs of these spiders are not nearly as large or strong as bees / wasps. To help identify the type of spider bite you have, capture the spider or take a photo with your phone and take it to a local clinic (someone might be able to identify it) or research it online. Most spider bites or harmless or cause only mild discomfort that fades away after a few days. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Treating spider bites with antiseptic gel, ice and over-the-counter medications is typically all that's needed. Generally speaking, spiders bite only in defense, particularly while being crushed between your skin and something else."

      "title": "Remember that many insect bites are more painful than spider bites.",
      "content": "Remember that many insect bites are more painful than spider bites. Spider bites are often falsely suspected by patients because they assume that spiders can do more damage than what they're actually capable of. [10] X Research source For example, insects such as bees and wasps use powerful stingers to inflict skin wounds, which does much more initial damage than the small fangs of spiders. A bee leaves its stinger in the skin and then dies shortly thereafter, whereas wasps (including hornets and yellow jackets) can sting you repeatedly. [11] X Research source Reaction to bee and wasp stings can range from minor skin swelling and redness (like a small contusion or bruise) to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) in those who are sensitive — medical attention may be necessary. Bees and wasps don't inject venom but kill many more people per year than spiders due to anaphylaxis reactions that go untreated. Anaphylaxis is usually controlled by epinephrine (adrenaline) injections that reduce the body's allergic response. An injection can be given by your doctor or administered at home if you have an epinephrine \"pen\". The type of spider bites most often confused with bee / wasp stings are from Hobo and Sac spiders. Black widow bites can cause similar serious symptoms, but their two-fanged puncture wound doesn't resemble a bee / wasp sting."

      "title": "Watch for painful scorpion stings.",
      "content": "Watch for painful scorpion stings . Although scorpions have crab-like pincers, they sting with their tail instead of pinching or biting. Scorpion stings are usually painful and cause localized redness and inflammation, but they are rarely serious and usually don't need medical attention. However, the bark scorpion can inflict potentially fatal stings because it produces a potent neurotoxic venom. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Although the sting marks of scorpions look much different than the two-fanged puncture wounds of black widows, the pain and other symptoms can be quite similar because both species produce neurotoxic venom. An antivenin (Anascorp) is available, but it's not used widely in the U.S. due to America's low mortality rates. Much like most spider bites, the vast majority of scorpion stings can be treated with antiseptic gel, ice, and over-the-counter medications. The bark scorpion is native to Arizona, New Mexico and parts of California."

      "title": "Don't confuse tick bites as spider bites.",
      "content": "Don't confuse tick bites as spider bites. Tick bites are sometimes confused as brown recluse spider bites (and vice versa) because they can also produce a skin reaction that looks like a bull's eye. Some ticks (such as deer ticks) may carry Lyme disease , so they shouldn't be taken lightly. Symptoms from a tick bite that carries Lyme disease include a skin rash in concentric rings, which appears up to a month later, as well as fever, fatigue, headaches, and aches in muscles and joints. [13] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The main differences from a brown recluse spider bite are that tick bites don't initially hurt and never lead to ulceration (necrosis) of the skin surrounding the bite. Another difference is that ticks usually burrow into the skin before infecting the host, so you can sometimes see them underneath the top layer of skin. In contrast, spiders don't burrow or nest in or on people."
