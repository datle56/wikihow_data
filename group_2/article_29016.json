      "content": "Pick out two sheets of 11 in × 17 in (28 cm × 43 cm) construction paper . Choose your favorite colors, colors that match a loved sports team, or your school colors. One sheet will be the front and back of your folder, while the other will make up the pockets. [1] X Research source Try using two sheets of the same color for a more classic look. Opt for complementary colors like yellow and purple for a pleasing look. Consider using scrapbook paper for a designer look. [2] X Research source The folder will be roughly 8.5 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) in size (half the size of the original construction paper). If you have larger sheets of construction paper, no worries! Cut them down to size with scissors, using a ruler to guide you."

Bring the left end over to the right until the edges align. Then, press down along the folded edge to hold the fold in place. This creates the spine of the folder. [5] X Research source"

Keep the sheets aligned while you do this, so the folder is symmetrical. Consider using multiple pieces of tape to create a stronger hold.

Apply strips of tape to the edges, folding the tape over halfway, to secure the pocket in place. Repeat this process on the other inside side with the other smaller piece of cardstock.

Spell out your name using letters you find in a magazine. Doodle on pictures or your friends and family for an added personal touch. Theme the collage around what’s inside the folder. For example, decorate the outside with pictures of famous singers if the folder holds your sheet music."
