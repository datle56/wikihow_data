      "title": "Store your sapphire-speckled Douglas slime in a sealed metal container.",
      "content": "Store your sapphire-speckled Douglas slime in a sealed metal container. A closed metal container will prevent light from fading the colors in your slime and keep it moist. When you’re not using the slime, keep the container closed to keep air out. Once every 2 ½ months, we recommend that you spritz your slime. To do so, mix club soda into your slime, which will help moisturize the slime and keep it from cracking. If your slime dries out before that, you can increase the spritzing schedule."
