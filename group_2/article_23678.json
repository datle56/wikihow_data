      "content": "\"Including but not limited to\" introduces a list of examples that does not include every possible option. For example, when applying for a job, the position details might read: “Responsibilities include but are not limited to overseeing large-scale projects, doing payroll for employees, and cold-calling potential customers.” This means that there may be other job responsibilities that weren't listed. When submitting a college paper, your professor’s rubric might read: “An ‘A’ paper includes but is not limited to thoughtful commentary, concrete examples from the text, and flawless grammar.” That means there may be other, unlisted things they'd also expect in an 'A' paper. When signing up for home insurance, the fine print might read: “Coverage includes but is not limited to property damage, pet damage, and legal fees.” That means the coverage may include other things that weren't listed. This expression allows people to provide a list of examples without needing to include every possible option. It prevents these lists from being overly long and complicated."

      "content": "The phrase can work with or without commas. Commas, like some other punctuations, can be a bit subjective. [2] X Research source They are meant to signal a pause in a sentence that is less pronounced than a period. Keeping this in mind, \"including but not limited to\" can function in either of the following ways. Without commas: \"We accept all kinds of payments, including but not limited to, credit card, cash, and Apple Pay.\" The only extra comma present is before the introduction of the list, which creates a small pause. With commas: \"There are so many beautiful beaches in Florida, including, but not limited to, Clearwater Beach and Sanibel Island.\" The two extra commas here offer a pause within a pause, which is still totally grammatically sound."

All of them offer examples that represent part of the group, but not the whole group. “Except as noted.” This common phrase can be used to describe a caveat or loophole in a contract. It can similarly be used in conversation. Prefacing a list of pre-determined items, “except as noted” lets the reader know that the rules stand… with a few exceptions. [4] X Research source Examples: “Except as noted in the paragraph below, no pets will be allowed.” “Except as noted in Section 5, all other holidays will be unpaid.” “Except as noted on the playbill, all songs will be original.” “Unless otherwise stated.” This expression seeks to clearly point out that unless a term is explicitly stated, the good old rules still apply. You can modify this in conversation by saying, “Unless otherwise said.” Moreover, you could also say, “Unless stated otherwise.” [5] X Research source Examples: “All the amenities in the common room are available to everyone, unless otherwise stated.” “Everyone here is invited to my birthday party… unless otherwise stated.” “Unless stated otherwise, there will not be time for questions afterwards.” “E.g.” From the Latin “exempli gratia”, e.g. means “for example.” Usually, e.g. is followed by one or two examples and is not meant to detail a long list. You can use it in writing or in conversation after making a statement that you want to provide examples for.
