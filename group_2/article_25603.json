      "content": "Push the end of each lace through the top of the bottom 2 eyelets. Thread the left end of the lace through the top of the bottom left eyelet, and the right end through the top of the bottom right eyelet. Line up the ends of the laces together, then pull upward to ensure each side is equal in length. [1] X Research source Stuff your sneaker with socks to prevent creasing and provide resistance under the tongue when you’re lacing."

      "title": "Pull the left lace under and through the eyelet above and diagonal to it.",
      "content": "Pull the left lace under and through the eyelet above and diagonal to it. Take the left lace and position it underneath the second eyelet from the bottom on the right. Pull the lace upward, moving from the underside of the eyelet to the outside. Then, double check that the lace is straight so you end up with a clean, crisp look. [2] X Research source If you’re going for the loose lace method, make sure you don’t pull the lace too tight so your foot has room to breathe."

      "title": "Thread the right lace under and through the eyelet above and diagonal to it.",
      "content": "Thread the right lace under and through the eyelet above and diagonal to it. Cross the right lace to the left side, and place it underneath the second eyelet from the bottom on the left. Thread the lace through the eyelet, pulling it from the underside of the eyelet to the outside. [3] X Research source To preserve your Jordans , hold your index finger under the right lace before pulling it through the eyelet—your finger will prevent the lace from creasing the tongue as you pull."

      "content": "Continue lacing up the shoe in this pattern until you reach the top 2 eyelets. Alternate threading the right and left laces by pulling the ends through the eyelets above and diagonal to them. Check that the lace is straight before crossing it to the other side, and be sure to position the lace below each eyelet before pulling it through—this ensures all the laces go in the same direction for a clean, uniform look. [4] X Research source Leave more eyelets empty if you want more room in your shoe, or lace them all the way up for a more snug fit."

      "content": "Tie the remaining lace in a bow, or tuck the loose ends inside the shoe. Tug on the tongue a few times to loosen up the lacing, then tie a bow with the leftover lace. If you don’t have enough lace to make a bow, slide on your shoe, then stuff the loose ends underneath the tongue for a fresh, factory-like finish. [5] X Research source If you want your shoes a little looser, pull on the diagonal lacing throughout the entire shoe to give yourself more space before tying it."

Continue repeating this pattern with the left lace to form new bars, and work your way up the entire shoe, leaving the last 2 eyelets empty.

After you’ve laced up the entire shoe, secure the leftover lace into a factory knot—loop both ends of the lace around your index and middle finger in an overhand direction, then cross the ends over the wrap and pinch them under your thumb. Then, hide the knot under the tongue of the shoe for a fresh and clean finish. [15] X Research source If you don’t have enough leftover lace to tie a knot, just tuck the ends inside the shoe after you put it on. Most people prefer to bar lace their mid and low Jordan 1s over their high Jordans 1s."
