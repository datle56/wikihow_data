You know in The Grinch , when his heart grows 3 sizes? That's Leo on an average day. This fire sign loves bravely: they throw their all into everything. In love, in friendships, in life, they never hold back in fear of getting hurt. Because Leo knows that to win big, you have to be bold. And this extends to romantic love. Leo believes in fairytales, and they want an over-the-top, cinematic love story."

      "content": "Loyal. Leo is fiercely protective of friends. When provoked, the lion has a real bite. And if there’s one thing Leo won’t tolerate, it’s an attack on their inner circle. They’ll gladly take the lead in a takedown, allowing you to stand behind them. And when you’re not around, they’ll defend you twice as hard. In short, though Leo is all warmth and razzle-dazzle on the surface, they’re a true friend. And they’re not to be messed with!"

      "content": "Generous. Combine a loving heart and an eye of material goods, and what do you get? A great gift giver! Leo is the single most generous sign in the zodiac because if they love you, they’ll want to show it. These fire signs love little luxuries, so to Leo, presents are always the best plan of action! This sign will show up at your doorstep with a shirt they knew you’d love. They’ll offer you the last bite of their fancy schmancy desert. They’ll pass you the charger, even when their phone’s at 1%. Leo just loves to love!"

Leo’s talent might crop up in surprising places, or it may exist in unexplored territory (as in, a medium they haven't tried yet!). But one thing’s for sure: whether it’s fashion, painting, music, or poetry, Leo has a powerful artistic energy flowing through them. And one day, it’ll lead to something great."

      "content": "Self-absorbed, dramatic. Is it all sunshine and daisies with this fire sign? Not quite. Leo’s confidence is a strength, but at times, it might look more like self-obsession. This sign gets a bad rep for being a little too involved with themselves and their own antics. In a way, the same things that make them special can be their downfall, so Leo should be careful here. They’d do well to keep their ego in check, so that it doesn’t eclipse their heart's efforts."

Are they just schmoozing you, or are they really interested? Look out for these telltale signs: They tell you they like you. That’s right, Leo doesn’t play it safe. If Leo has a crush, there’s a good chance they’ll come right out and tell you. They give you little presents. They might not start with big gifts, but a candy bar here, a used book there—if Leo’s crushing, they’ll want to brighten your day. They touch you casually. Typically, Leo’s into physical touch. So they might throw an arm over your shoulder or go in for the hug if they're crushing on you. They plan a grand, romantic gesture. If you spot rose petals and champagne, they’re serious about you. Leo will want you to feel like you're in a fairytale. You hear from their friends. If Leo thinks you're worthy of their friend’s time, that’s a game changer. You’re in! \"Oh yeah, I've heard that you're really cool...\""

      "content": "What it’s like to date a Leo: Leo is a superstar searching for an admiring audience. Are you up to the challenge? The truth is, dating Leo is a lovely, life-changing experience, full of warmth, joy, and care. Typically, partners do come to admire Leo like a fan would admire their favorite celebrity. But it’s for more than charm or theatrics. You’ll love Leo for their passion, their courage, and their kindness. Typically, people leave this relationship feeling more confident in themselves and in their future. Thank you, Leo! Date night: Karaoke. A dazzling, well-planned theme party. A 5-star dinner with candles, wine, and a string quartet. Downside: As generous as Leo is, they sometimes focus more on themselves than others. This is something that they have to look out for in relationships, because it is unintentional. Leo, remember that your partner deserves the same amount of attention that you expect from them, and stay focused—otherwise, you could lose sight of what’s important."

They're sociable and charming, the celebs of your inner circle. Together, it seems like there's nothing they can't do (falling in love included!). Libra and Leo don't just take a pretty picture, though: they're fun, warm, and adventurous, which makes for a gorgeous, deep connection. The only downside? Both Libra and Leo love to be doted on, but in love, they’ll both have to get used to giving . They finally have a partner who’s as high-maintenance as they are, so adjustments will have to be made!"

Both partners will admire the other's confidence, beauty, and performative streak, stoking the flames of this wild, blazing romance. Plus, Leo has sky-high expectations for romance—fairytales, sweet nothings, glitz and glamour. With another Leo, they’ll get to indulge in their dream. Leos have a flair for dramatics, so these two might fall into a hot-and-cold affair if they're not careful. To keep the peace and find a satisfying dynamic, they’ll both have to fight their instincts and focus on being mature."

      "content": "Leo & Aries. How would we summarize a Leo-Aries love affair in one word? Passion . Leo and Aries bring their A-game in love—mundane moments are their common enemy. And on top of that, their differences complement each other beautifully; Aries will help Leo reach their dreams, and Leo will inspire Aries to believe in themself. If any couple were to take over the world just for kicks, you know who it’d be! Aries and Leo are fire signs (and quick to anger). Luckily, they typically drop things quickly too, but still, shouting matches are no fun for anyone. Take our advice Aries and Leo: work to de-escalate fights early and save yourself the pain."

There's nothing Leo and Sag won't think to explore together, whether it's the next town over, or their partner's wildest fantasies. These two are built for spontaneity, socialite-ing, and joy. And together, we have no doubt that they'll find the easy, laughter-filled romance that less exciting signs only dream about. Sag and Leo will love getting flirty with each other, but when Leo realizes that Sag flirts with, well, everyone , it could cause issues. These two should define their relationship early, because they tend to move at different speeds in love!"

      "content": "Leo & Pisces. On the surface, these two seem to be opposites: Pisces is a sweet wanderer and Leo, a bold leader. But look a little deeper, and you’ll see that Leo and Pisces are actually cut from the same cloth. They're soft romantics at heart, with a rose-colored view of the world and an eye for magic—this will fuel a lovely, authentic connection. Plus, their surface-level differences complement each other too. Pisces can soften Leo’s rougher edges, and Leo protects Pisces in times of crisis. Communication, though, might be an area for these two to work on. Leo can be a steamroller, and Pisces usually rolls over in a fight. But it’s important that both partners feel heard for this relationship to last!"

      "content": "Leo & Gemini. Leo and Gemini will live in their own little world, one filled with niche meme references, giggles, and endless love. This is the couple who's so lost in their love, they can't help but to show it. They'll be across the room from each other at a party, lock eyes, and beam at their partner like they're staring at a sunset. The admiration between these two runs deep, and the joyfulness runs even deeper. On the surface, these two are all fun and games, but deep down, Leo is a serious romantic. Gemini, on the other hand, prefers to keep things casual, so they'll have to be careful about defining their relationship to make sure everyone gets what they want."

This dependable, grounded knight in shining armor can offer all the stability and sensuality that Leo craves, and together, they can luxuriate in domestic bliss. As long as they find a balance that works for both of them, they'll be golden. But will they? Taurus isn't possessive, but they are a little stubborn. Whenever Leo chooses a party or night out over 1:1 time with Taurus, it'll hurt the sensitive bull. Over time, this could lead to some resentment."

      "title": "Leo & Scorpio.",
      "content": "Leo & Scorpio. This is the definition of a \"go big or go home\" romance. Scorpio is ruled by Pluto: their power is transformation, magic, and intuition. Scorpio is an expert in hidden, mysterious things. Leo, ruled by the sun, is all about confidence, optimism, and fire—they appreciate life under the spotlight. So, these two are polar opposites, and if a romance blooms, it'll be life-changing, like nothing they've experienced before. Both signs will leave it feeling transformed. But will it actually happen? The stars would have to line up perfectly for these two to give it a chance, so we doubt it. But trust that if you do manage to make a Leo-Scorpio romance work, it'll be one in a million!"

      "title": "Leo & Cancer.",
      "content": "Leo & Cancer. At first glance, these two don't make a ton of sense together: Cancer is a sensitive sweetie, and Leo is a fiery force. But dig a little deeper, and there are some compelling compatibilities. Cancer and Leo are romantics, so they'll both enjoy the heartfelt connection they crave. Cancer can help Leo unpack their deeper emotions, which will please Leo. Leo can make Cancer feel like a superstar, which, given that Cancer feels unappreciated by their loved ones, will be exciting for this water sign. But there are definitely hurdles here as well. Cancer wants 24/7 time with their partner, and Leo (a fire sign) will want their independence. And Leo can be, er, blunt ...but Cancer doesn't have a thick skin. Because of this, communication might be an issue."

      "content": "Leo & Capricorn. Leo will appreciate that Cap is a devoted, supportive partner; Capricorn will love that Leo can help them schmooze the room at networking events. There's definitely room for romance here, but still, there might be more hurdles than points of connection. Can Cap give Leo the fairytale they're dreaming about? Can Leo get serious and earn Cap's deepest respect? It depends. If Capricorn has some more romantic placements (like a water sign Venus, for example) and Leo has some prominent earth placements, then these two might have a shot. If not, they might struggle to bridge the gap."

      "title": "Leo & Virgo.",
      "content": "Leo & Virgo. This might be a tricky matchup. Leo is looking for an outgoing romantic, and Virgo is in the market for a responsible, serious partner. Generally speaking, neither sign fits the bill. Though this isn't a super contentious or toxic matchup, it just might lack that spark that romances need to survive. That said, if you're interested in a Leo-Virgo relationship, don't give up hope just yet! There are definitely some attractions here. Virgo has a gorgeous, meticulous appearance (Leo will love that!). And Leo is fiercely loyal, which Virgo will admire. Plus, if both signs happen to have other, more compatible elements in their charts (like compatible Mercury or Venus signs, for instance), they could still line up well."

      "content": "Leo & Aquarius. Uh oh, this is a tough one! Air and fire signs tend to get along well, (and in fairness, these two do fine as friends) but this romance spells trouble. These two have very little in common. Aquarius hates trends, but Leo is the one setting them. Leo wants grand romance, but Aquarius can't stomach mushiness. All in all, this connection might struggle to get off the ground. But is all hope lost? Never! Sun signs really aren't the full story, so if you're interested in an Aquarius-Leo romance, check out the rest of your charts. If your Venus and Mercury signs line up, then that's a great sign!"
