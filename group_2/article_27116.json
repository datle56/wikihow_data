If you choose to use a fragranced one, however, make sure that it's a scent you like.

How long you leave the fabric squares in the bowl doesn't matter as long as each square is thoroughly soaked. [4] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, pull on a pair of rubber gloves.

Smooth out the wrinkles caused by the wringing, then set them aside.

The length of the string doesn’t matter, as long as you can fit all of the fabric squares on it. Alternatively, drape the fabric squares over a drying rack. [6] X Research source How long it takes for the fabric to dry will depend on how hot and humid it is. It will dry faster in warmer, drier climates. Expect to wait a few hours, however. Don’t use a dryer to speed up the process. You want these to air dry. If you diluted the fabric softener with water, you don't need to let the fabric squares dry. Simply store them in an airtight container until you're ready to use it. [7] X Research source"

You can roll the sheets up into bundles or fold them up into squares. Don't be afraid to get a little creative here! [8] X Research source If you soaked the fabric squares, pour some of the diluted fabric softener into the container too. This will prevent them from drying out.

Vinegar has natural deodorizing and fabric softening properties, so it's a great choice for all-natural dryer sheets.

You can use just 1 type of oil, or you can mix fragrances. For example, you could use 6 drops of lavender essential oil and 4 drops of tea tree oil. If you doubled the amount of vinegar, then double the amount of essential oil. About 16 to 20 drops will do. You can find essential oils online and in health food stores. Do not use fragrance oils meant for candle-making or diffusers; they're not the same thing."

Stir them together carefully with a spoon so that you don't create any bubbles or froth. [12] X Research source You can increase or decrease the amounts, as long as you use a ratio of 3 parts conditioner and 1 part vinegar. If possible, use a natural, organic hair conditioner that's free of sulfates, parabens, dimethicone, artificial preservatives, and synthetic fragrances. Use whatever type of conditioner you want. Since this isn't going to do anything for your hair, a cheap, inexpensive brand would work just fine."
