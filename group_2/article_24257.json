      "title": "Turn the water supply valve to shut off the water supply.",
      "content": "Turn the water supply valve to shut off the water supply. Locate the main water supply to the building. It’ll be where the water utility line enters your home, either inside or outside that room. It’s often near the water heating unit and has a red handle. Turn it clockwise to shut off the water. Always shut the valve that is closest to the inside plumbing, and don’t shut the valve that is closest to the street. If the room where the sink will be installed has supply valves, you can shut them off instead. They’ll be on the water pipes, but this isn’t always an option."

      "title": "Cut through the drain pipe with a hacksaw.",
      "content": "Cut through the drain pipe with a hacksaw . Locate the room’s drain pipe and pick where you’ll attach the sink’s pipes to it. It’ll run along the room near either the floor or ceiling, depending on where you’re installing the sink. Use a hacksaw to sever the pipe. [1] X Research source To figure out which pipe is which, consult the house’s blueprint or listen as water flows through the pipe. The drain pipe flows away from the building. If the pipe is overhead, such as in some basements, purchase a sink sump pump from the home improvement store."

      "title": "Spread PVC cement over a wye fitting.",
      "content": "Spread PVC cement over a wye fitting. First, go to a home improvement store and pick up a wye fitting. This piece of PVC pipe has a “Y” shape and is used to connect 3 pipes together. Brush PVC primer around the ends of the drain pipe to clean them. Then spread PVC cement inside the larger ends of the wye fitting. If your drain pipe is cast iron, it’s better to buy a rubber wye fitting and solder the pipes together instead of gluing them."

    {
      "title": "Slide the wye fitting over the drain pipe’s ends.",
      "content": "Slide the wye fitting over the drain pipe’s ends. Gently pull one end of the pipe to the side. Place the wye fitting on the pipe, then connect its other end to the remaining pipe. Hold the fitting in place for 4 seconds so the glue settles. The wye fitting should be positioned so the small, unattached opening faces towards where your sink will go."

    {
      "title": "Saw through the vent pipe.",
      "content": "Saw through the vent pipe. Look for a length of PVC pipe splitting from the drain pipe. It’ll go towards the ceiling and, if you follow it, to the roof. Pick a spot on the pipe above the wye fitting and near the ceiling. Use the hacksaw to sever the vent pipe. The vent pipe helps the sink drain and prevents sewer gas from entering the house."

      "content": "Install a wye fitting in the vent pipe. Prime the vent pipe, then coat a 2nd wye fitting with PVC cement. Slide it onto the pipe parts to reconnect the vent. The small opening on the wye fitting should be angled downwards towards the other fitting."

      "content": "Connect the wye fittings with PVC pipe. First, attach a T-shaped tee fitting to the lower wye fitting. Position it so the middle opening faces the higher wye fitting. Now connect the 2 by gluing together lengths of PVC pipe. If you’re using a sump pump, connect it to the vent and drain pipes according to the owner’s manual. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Solder the copper pipes together with a propane torch. Hold some lead-free metal solder over one of the connecting joints. Turn on the torch and angle it so the end of the flame hits the solder. Move the torch from side to side to evenly heat the solder, melting it over the joint. Repeat this for the other joints on the pipes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Move the sink near the pipes. Set the sink in place to prepare for installation. Utility sinks are typically freestanding, so yours shouldn’t need extra fitting. Position the faucet openings near the wall. If the floor is uneven, adjust the screws on the sink’s legs until the sink appears level."
