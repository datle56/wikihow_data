      "content": "Wait a day or two. You don’t want to look desperate by texting immediately, but you also don’t want to wait too long. Many women say they lose interest if they don’t hear from a guy pretty soon after that initial exchange of numbers. About 24 to 36 hours is a good rule of thumb. [1] X Research source"

Don’t allow texting to become a habitual exchange between the two of you. In addition, texting a lot with someone you don't know well can be awkward and she might read it as a sign that you're not really that interested. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Remind her about seeing you last. If you just met, re-introduce yourself; if she is someone you know or knew, but haven't texted with, mention that she gave you her number. If she doesn't have your number, she may not have any clue who you are when you first text. Try saying “Hi Stella. It’s me, Stanley, we talked on Monday.” If you exchanged some small talk, bring it up. Remind her that there was a spark of interest when you both met. Stay away from anything negative about the situation when you met. If she was irked about the long line at the DMV, don’t remind her of feeling irritated. Tell her how great it was talking with her. Say something like “Chatting with you made waiting in line actually fun.”"

So don’t make sarcastic remarks, or make remarks that read as critical, complaining, or insecure.

You can come up with something to say from your previous conversations, and from information she has given you about herself. Try checking on something she was involved with or trying to get done. You could say, “So, how did your driver’s license photograph turn out?” Ask her if she likes or frequents the place where you two saw each other last. Check on how her day or week is going.

Don’t call early in the morning. Most people have a pretty tight morning schedule and can’t really take time for a phone conversation. Immediately after work might be a good time, but be aware that end of day routines are more variable than start of day. She may be meeting friends, or going to a class, or just looking forward to getting home and in front of the television. Don’t call past 7:00 or 7:30 pm. Just like morning routines, evening schedules can be very packed and very tight. You don’t want to interrupt her, and possibly annoy her, with a phone call when she’s trying to wind down for the evening."

This will keep you from stammering or rambling, and knowing exactly what you are going to say will help you focus more on how you sound rather what you are saying."

Also, make sure you aren't in a noisy space that makes it hard to hear what you are saying. [5] X Research source Do not call her while you are in distracting or stressful situations. Driving, waiting for your train or bus, or being in the middle of something else are all bad times to try to call. You don’t want to be tempted to yell at another driver or lose your train of thought because of multitasking. Do not call her just because you have some time on your hands. You don’t want her to think that you’re calling just because you haven’t anything better to do at the moment. Call when you're sure you won’t be interrupted by anything or anyone else. Turn off the television, shut down your computer, and turn your music off or to a very low volume. Focus your attention on the phone call and nothing else. Do not call from a crowded bar or restaurant, or while standing or walking in busy places like city streets or train stations. The chances of being interrupted or needing to hang up suddenly are huge, and you will be distracted as well as fighting to be heard over the noise."

If you’re pretty sure she’s often available during the time you called, try the same time again in a day or two. Don’t wait more than one or two days to try again.

Speak clearly and with a relaxed tone when you're leaving your message, and don't talk too fast; she might not get everything you say and you will sound nervous. Also refrain from talking in an exaggerated manner or too slowly. Leave your number twice, once at the beginning of your message, and once at the end.
