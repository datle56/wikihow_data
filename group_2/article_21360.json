      "content": "Purchase mushroom spawn of the species you want to grow. Mushroom spawn is sawdust or grain that’s been permeated with mushroom mycelia — essentially the root structure of the fungus. It is used much like plant seedlings to facilitate growth. [1] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source You can purchase high-quality mushroom spawn from online retailers, gardening supply stores, or specialty mushroom cultivators. Make sure to buy spawn rather than spores. Some retailers will also sell spores, which are more like the seeds of plants (rather than seedlings). Growing mushrooms from spores takes more time and practice, and is best suited for a seasoned mushroom grower. Which types of mushrooms are easiest to grow at home ? Oyster, white button , and shiitake mushrooms are the easiest to grow at home. The method for growing each mushroom is similar, but the ideal growing substrate differs. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a substrate that works for the species you’re growing. Once you decide which type of mushroom you want to grow, choose a substrate that’s well-suited for that species. For oyster mushrooms, you might choose shredded newspaper, straw, sawdust, or cardboard. If you’re growing shiitake or lion’s mane, you might use sawdust or wood fuel pellets. [3] X Research source If you use sawdust, make sure it is from untreated hardwood. Other common substrates include used coffee grounds or tea bags or composted manure. If you use spent coffee grounds or tea bags immediately after using them, they’ll already be sterile, so you can skip the step on sterilizing the substrate. For an easy option, buy a pre-made mushroom substrate block . It will come pre-sterilized, so you can skip the next step."

      "title": "Sterilize your substrate to kill any bacteria.",
      "content": "Sterilize your substrate to kill any bacteria. One of the most difficult aspects of growing mushrooms is avoiding contamination. You have to sterilize the substrate to kill off any microorganisms that could compete with the mushroom mycelia. There are a few different methods for preparing your substrate for inoculation, including: Heat: Bring the substrate to a temperature of at least 160–170 °F (71–77 °C) for about 1 hour to pasteurize it. For instance, you might put the substrate into a mesh bag or pillow case and submerge it in 170 °F (77 °C) water for an hour. [4] X Research source Peroxide: Soak your substrate in water, then soak it in a solution of 4.2 cups (0.99 l) of 3% hydrogen peroxide to 1 US gal (3.8 l) of water. Leave it submerged for about 24 hours, then drain it well and rinse it twice with fresh water. Water: Place the substrate in a mesh bag or pillow case and submerge it in water for 1-2 weeks. Microwave: Place your substrate in a heat-safe plastic bag and dampen the substrate, then place the bag in a microwave-safe bowl. Leave the bag slightly open and cover the container loosely, then microwave for about 5 minutes. Use a thermometer to make sure the substrate reaches 175 °F (79 °C). [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix the substrate and mushroom spawn in a sterilized container. Sterilize your environment as much as possible to avoid contaminating your substrate—wear a fresh pair of gloves and wipe down your work surface with a disinfectant or rubbing alcohol. Also sterilize your container, then mix the sawdust or grain containing your mushroom spawn into the container holding your substrate. [6] X Research source The process of spreading the mushroom spawn into the substrate is called inoculation. Suitable containers include large plastic bags, buckets, or storage totes. Some mushroom growers prefer spreading the spawn on top of the substrate instead of mixing it in. This may be a good option if you’re using a container that’s difficult to mix in, like a mason jar, but it may take longer for the substrate to be fully colonized. [7] X Research source"

If you’re using a container that doesn’t have a lid, cover the container with plastic. To create a dark environment, you may need to place another container over the grow bag, like a plastic storage tote ."

      "content": "Keep the container at around 70 °F (21 °C) during colonization. It can take a few weeks for the mushroom mycelia to permeate the substrate. During this time, monitor the temperature in the container. Ideally, it should stay at around 70 °F (21 °C). It’s okay if the temperature is a little higher or lower, but it shouldn’t go above 80 °F (27 °C) or below 55 °F (13 °C). [8] X Research source The mushroom mycelium will produce heat as they grow, so watch carefully to make sure the container doesn’t get too hot—the mycelium will start to die off and unwanted bacteria can start to grow. You may need to turn on a fan near the container to help keep it cool. If you’re colonizing the mushrooms in a very cold room, you may need to place the container on a small heat mat , like the kind used for plant seedlings or reptile habitats. Some mushrooms species may need slightly higher or lower temperatures for colonization. When you’re checking the temperature inside the container, avoid exposing the substrate block to too much light or the mycelia might die off."

      "title": "Move the container to fruiting conditions once it’s completely white.",
      "content": "Move the container to fruiting conditions once it’s completely white. Once the substrate is fully colonized, you’ll need to create fruiting conditions for the mushrooms to start growing. The exact fruiting conditions can vary by species and strain, but most species will prefer cooler temperatures of about 62–65 °F (17–18 °C), 80-85% humidity, and bright, indirect lighting. [9] X Research source It can take up to 4 weeks for colonization to take place. Don’t switch to fruiting conditions until the substrate is entirely covered with white fuzz. You may also see tiny mushrooms called “pins” starting to appear. If you’re growing shiitakes, keep them in the colonization environment for an extra 2-3 weeks after the substrate colonizes—they require an additional “popcorning” period in order to fully fruit. You’ll also need to shock the substrate block in water after the popcorning period to start the fruiting process. For most species, just opening the bag and lowering the temperature will be enough to encourage the mushrooms to start fruiting."

If the humidity drops below about 80%, mist the container with a spray bottle filled with water. If the temperature gets above 70 °F (21 °C), turn on a fan or move the mushrooms to a cooler area. If the temperature drops below 50–55 °F (10–13 °C), add a heating mat. [10] X Research source Each mushroom species may have its own fruiting requirements for temperature, humidity, and airflow, so be sure to check the suppliers’ website for growing specifics. [11] X Research source Also, watch for any purple, green, or brown spots growing on your substrate—these indicate contamination. If you see this, remove these areas from your substrate and throw them out. If you’re keeping your mushrooms in an enclosed container, like a plastic tote, open the lid a few times every day to give them fresh air."

When the mushroom caps separate fully from their stems, they are ready to harvest. To harvest the mushrooms, plant and garden specialist Olivia Choong recommends either plucking the mushrooms out with your fingers or using a sharp knife to cut the mushrooms at the base of the stem. It is best to rinse the mushrooms before cooking or eating. You can store harvested mushrooms in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to a week."

This will help the mushrooms maintain the humidity they need to start growing.

If they’re not growing or the caps look cracked, add more humidity. If the mushrooms look pale, move them to a brighter area.

Golden oysters needs a temperature of 65–80 °F (18–27 °C) to grow, and once colonized, they're ready to harvest in about 7–14 days. Blue oyster: Blue oyster mushrooms are meaty with a mild flavor. They need temperatures between 55–75 °F (13–24 °C), and they're ready to harvest 7–14 days after colonization. Pink oyster: Pink oyster mushrooms are prized for their delicate pink tint and meaty flavor. They can even be used as a substitute for bacon! They need higher temperatures, around 70–80 °F (21–27 °C), and are ready to harvest 7–14 days after colonization. Italian oyster: These are considered a delicacy, and they have an aroma similar to licorice. They prefer temperatures of 65–75 °F (18–24 °C), and they're ready 7–10 days after colonization."
