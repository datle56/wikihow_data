      "content": "Write down everything you would like to accomplish. Review your list and prioritize what absolutely has to get done that week, such as a task with a looming deadline. Setting specific goals helps keep you motivated and will make you feel extra accomplished when you’ve achieved everything you set out to do. Challenge yourself to complete more than you think you can, but don’t go overboard. If you have a massive research paper due on Friday, it’s probably not the time to add organizing your entire home and writing a novel to your list. Instead, try setting the goals of finishing your research paper, organizing your closet, and writing ten pages of your novel."

      "title": "Use a calendar or a piece of paper for scheduling.",
      "content": "Use a calendar or a piece of paper for scheduling. Map out exactly how you want to use your time each day, leaving nothing out of your schedule. Include how much time you would like to spend on each task. For example, start your schedule with something like, “7:30 AM - 8:00 AM: Wake up and eat breakfast.” Follow that with the first major task of your day, such as “8:00 AM - 8:30 AM: Answer emails.” [1] X Research source You may not follow your schedule exactly, as life can sometimes surprise you with how long a task will take.

      "content": "Pick the hardest or most pressing task of the day to do first. Let’s say you’ve got a colossal amount of homework to do, and you don’t know where to start. Review the due dates of your assignments as well as the difficulty level of each one, and prioritize accordingly. Getting a difficult, time consuming assignment out of the way first will make you feel accomplished and ready to tackle the rest of your to-do list! [2] X Research source For example, if you have a massive math assignment due tomorrow and some quick vocabulary worksheets due at the end of the week, start with the math homework."

      "title": "It’s hard to get things done when you’re doing too many things at once.",
      "content": "It’s hard to get things done when you’re doing too many things at once. As you cross things off your to-do list, keep your mind focused on the task at hand. Shut out thoughts about your other responsibilities, and avoid going back and forth between unrelated duties. It’s much more efficient to tackle one responsibility at a time. [3] X Research source For example, instead of answering emails and returning phone calls at the same time, answer all of your emails before you make your phone calls. Switching back and forth between tasks is more work for your brain and slows down the process."

      "content": "You can't work or be productive 24 hours a day. Schedule breaks throughout your day to give yourself some time to rest and relax. A break allows you to recharge and come back to a task with a fresh perspective.

      "content": "You don't have to do everything yourself! Allowing another person to take care of something gives you a chance to devote yourself to your other tasks while still getting everything done. Be sure you delegate to someone reliable and trustworthy! You don’t want to worry about whether the person will actually get it done. Remember that delegating is a sign of strength and intelligence, not weakness. Everyone has to ask for help sometimes!"

      "title": "Take note of what you completed as well as what still needs to get done.",
      "content": "Take note of what you completed as well as what still needs to get done. Cross off the tasks you finished and make a new to-do list for the next day, starting with what you didn’t accomplish. Making time for this extra step each night helps you celebrate what you achieved while keeping your goals for the next day in mind. It can also help you get a better idea of what tasks take the most time. Use that information to reassess how much time you should give yourself to complete certain tasks. [8] X Research source It’s completely okay to find that you didn’t get all of your tasks done! Remember that tomorrow is a new day. Keep pushing yourself to meet your goals!"

      "content": "At the start of a task, promise yourself a reward at the end of it. For example, if you have a writing assignment you need to complete but are in no mood to do, allow yourself to go on a 20-minute walk to a nearby park once you’re done with the assignment! Make sure your reward is something that you really enjoy. Your reward should never cause a setback or get you off track. For example, going to the movies or taking the rest of the day off after completing a 30-minute task may not be a good idea."

      "title": "It’s easy to take on more than you can handle.",
      "content": "It’s easy to take on more than you can handle. Be realistic when agreeing to new responsibilities, keeping what you have to get done already in mind. For example, if your schedule is fully booked with classes and soccer practice during the school week, it may not be the best time to join another club. [9] X Expert Source Sydney Axelrod Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. Learn to say “no.\" If you cannot say no, be honest about your time constraints. For example, if someone asks you to get something done by the end of the day, you may say, “I'm a little overloaded right now, but I can have it to you by the end of tomorrow.” Over-scheduling can also lead to stress. When you are stressed, you become less productive."

      "content": "Make a quick list when you’ve got extra time. For example, try using the bus ride to work or school to do some extra planning. This is especially helpful if you find yourself particularly stressed out about your responsibilities during your leisure time!
