      "title": "Crown",
      "content": "Crown On authentic Seiko watches, the crown is a screwing crown, which means it needs to be screwed in to change the date and time. However, fake Seiko watches use quartz movement crowns instead of screwing crowns. Quartz crowns change the date, time, and day by pulling in different positions, so if that’s how you’re adjusting things on your Seiko, it may be fake. [1] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Screwing crown that changes the date and time by screwing the knob. Signs It’s Fake: Quartz crown that changes the date and time by pulling the knob."

      "title": "Bezel",
      "content": "Bezel The bezel on a real Seiko watch rotates for 120 clicks. However, the bezel on a fake Seiko watch rotates for 60 clicks. Fake models also have a shiny finish on the bezel, while real models have a matte finish. Check the bezel’s pearl, as well. Located towards the top of the watch, pearls are fit into the bezel on real models and drawn on fake models. [2] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Bezel rotates for 120 clicks, has a matte finish, and has a pearl fit into it. Signs It’s Fake: Bezel rotates for 60 clicks, has a shiny finish, and has a pearl drawn into it."

      "title": "Dial",
      "content": "Dial On fake Seiko models, the lettering near the dial is thin and leaves a bit more spacing than on real models. On real Seiko models, the lettering is thicker and evenly spaced. Below the 6:00 marker, there is orange text that reads “DIVER’S 200.” Below that, there is text that reads “21 Jewels.” On replica watches, this orange is often replaced with red, the font is noticeably thinner, and the “21 Jewels” text is gone entirely. [3] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Even lettered spacing, “21 Jewels” text, orange “DIVER’S 200” text. Signs It’s Fake: Open spacing, noticeably thinner font, and red “DIVER’S 200” text. Look for “Made In Japan” and the watch caliber around the 6:00 marker, too. On authentic models, the text is bold and easy to read. On fake models, the lettering is smudged and the watch may be missing “Made In Japan.”"

    {
      "title": "Luminescence",
      "content": "Luminescence Many Seiko watches have luminescent features that make it easier to tell time when you’re in the dark. Authentic models like the Seiko LumiBrite pull this off smoothly, but fakes typically produce a weaker, more inconsistent light. To see if your watch is real or fake, expose it to bright light for a few minutes, then go into a dark room. Real Seikos provide consistent and long-lasting luminescence, while fakes provide a brightness that’s weak and fades quickly. Signs It’s Real: Consistent, long-lasting brightness. Signs It’s Fake: Weak, inconsistent brightness that fades quickly."

    {
      "title": "Day & Date",
      "content": "Day & Date The day & date window is typically sleek and evenly aligned on real Seiko watches. On fake Seiko watches, the fonts are bigger than they would be on real models, the colors are less bright, and in some cases, the day and date may not be properly aligned with one another. If your Seiko watch has large, dim lettering that looks poorly constructed, it may be fake. [4] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Sleek, bright, evenly aligned day & date. Signs It’s Fake: Dull day & date that’s misaligned and/or has a large font."

      "title": "Case Back",
      "content": "Case Back The Seiko case back has the logo and serial number engraved into the back, along with other text. On real Seikos, “JAPAN,” “STAINLESS STEEL,” “SEIKO,” and the serial number are engraved into the case back. On fake Seikos, the quality difference is noticeable, with “JAPAN” featuring a thick or thin font depending on the fake, “STAINLESS STEEL” being far bigger than it should be, and weak engravings. Sometimes, text is missing from the fake watch entirely. [5] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Rounded text with quality engravings. Signs It’s Fake: Weak engravings, missing text, and fonts that are either too large or too small."

      "title": "Second Hand",
      "content": "Second Hand Depending on your Seiko model, the watch may have an automatic second hand or a ticking second hand. Models like the SKX007 feature an automatic second hand that smoothly glides around the watch instead of ticking once per second. If your model is said to be automatic but you hear ticking, you likely have a fake on your hands. [6] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Smooth-gliding second hand on automatic models. Signs It’s Fake: Ticking second hand on an automatic model. The second hand on authentic models ticks six times every two seconds."

      "title": "Lugs",
      "content": "Lugs Authentic Seiko watches have unnoticeable lugs that smoothly attach the band, while fake Seiko watches have drilled lugs on the sides. If you look at your watch and notice that the lugs are drilled, that’s a definitive sign that your Seiko watch is fake and that you may want to look into the seller’s return process . Signs It’s Real: Unnoticeable lugs that are inside the watch. Signs It’s Fake: Drilled lugs."

Fake Seiko watches often come in a plain, unbranded black box that lacks any of the proper manuals and certificates. If you got your Seiko in a plain black box with nothing but the watch, you may have a fake on your hands. [7] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Comes in a branded box with the watch, an instruction manual, a warranty manual, and a certificate of warranty. Signs It’s Fake: Comes in a plain, unbranded black box."

[8] X Research source On average, Seiko models cost around $400 (with fluctuations depending on the model). [9] X Research source If you find a model online that’s going for $30-$40, do further research to verify its authenticity. Look up the specific model on Seiko’s website to see if it’s near what you’re currently looking at. Signs It’s Real: It’s priced somewhere around $400, fluctuating between the hundreds and thousands depending on the model. Signs It’s Fake: The price is severely lower than retail and market value. Market prices tend to vary, but models with severely low prices are often counterfeit."

This polishing also gives the Grand Seiko a shiny finish, so if you find that your Grand Seiko is looking a little dull and lacks a shiny, dancing finish, you might have a fake on your hands. [13] X Research source Signs It’s Real: A shiny, mirror-like finish. Signs It’s Fake: A dull, weak finish."

To verify the serial number and make sure your product is legit, either use an automatic serial number checker, like EmmyWatch , or manually date it. The first number in the serial number is the year and the second is the month. 1-9 covers January-September, while O, N, and D are used to represent October, November, and December. [14] X Research source A serial number that reads 456789 could mean May 1974, May 1984, May 1994, May 2004, May 2014, or May 2024. Seiko watches made before 1968 have 7-digit serial numbers, while watches made after 1968 have 6-digit serial numbers. Seiko watches that are made in Japan are marked with an SR or S near the serial number."
