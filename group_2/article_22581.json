      "content": "Stop crying. You may have to wait a few minutes before you stop crying. You will eventually stop. It is better to let yourself cry than force yourself to stop. Pent-up emotions are being expressed when you cry which allows the body to release tension and recover. Try to bring yourself back into the present moment and remind yourself that you're safe right now, this can help you to settle down. Try using your five sense to get back into the present moment. What do you see within the room? Can you think about things that you might smell, if you smell anything, you can notice if you taste anything? By using your senses you can calm down and recover from crying. If you are in a time crunch and you need to stop crying, tell yourself, “You need to stop crying and find the calm inside you.” Repeat this until you stop. You can also purposely startle yourself. This will create a quick shift in your emotions and will help you stop. Simply saying, “Oh!” might do the trick. Redirect your emotions with a pinch to your arm. This can cause enough of a distraction to switch off your crying response. Once you have stopped crying, distract your thoughts away from the reason for crying. If you just received news that someone passed away, focus on what you need to do that day. Crying is related to many positive events as well as sad or maddening events. Allow yourself to cry until you stop."

      "content": "Attend to the redness in your eyes, nose, and face. When a person cries, blood rushes to the face, eyes, and nose areas. Once you stop crying, the skin will eventually return to its normal color. Use a cold compress and place it over your eyes, nose, and face. This will speed up the calming process. If you are at work or elsewhere and a cold compress is not available, wet paper towels and spin them in the air to cool them. This will do the trick. Fan your face using a piece of paper or whatever you can find to allow air to rush over your face. This will cool your face, which will reduce the redness."

The goal is to refocus your attention away from the issue at hand. Tell yourself, “You are going to think about something positive like how much you love going to the beach. Yes, that is what you are focusing on now.” Think about a project you are working on. Make a mental list of the steps you need to take and when you will get them accomplished.
