      "title": "Set up a complete profile.",
      "content": "Set up a complete profile. An account with a complete profile is more likely to get followers than a profile that lacks information. [1] X Research source Make sure your profile reflects what you post. When people look at your profile and see pictures of cats, they expect videos of cats and will follow you with that expectation. If you have a profile of cats but post videos of skateboard tricks, you will most likely lose credibility and followers."

      "title": "Use hashtags effectively.",
      "content": "Use hashtags effectively. When you post a video that features a cat and cucumber, make sure you use accurate hashtags, like #cat and #cucumber. If you correctly used hashtags, your video should appear in the search results for people who search for \"cats.\" By correctly using hashtags, you are enabling your video to show up in searches that could mean potential views. You have the option to add hashtags when you're prompted to add a description to your post. Tap # Hashtags to start tagging."

    {
      "title": "Try to make original videos.",
      "content": "Try to make original videos. Since many TikTok users lip-sync to popular songs, an original video will stand out. But don't make videos that are all the same, since that can get boring. A TikTok user that makes original and interesting content is more likely to gain more followers than a TikTok user who only produces unoriginal content. If you're interested in making lip-sync videos, make sure you keep it interesting. You can look at popular artists and mimic elements from them. Try to find a niche that you fit into that you can post content about so you can find a more dedicated audience."

    {
      "title": "Use the right music.",
      "content": "Use the right music. You have the option to use a clip of music in every TikTok video, and choosing the right music can either increase or decrease its probability of being liked. If your video is funny, don't use a sad song."
    },
    {
      "title": "Upload a video at least once a day.",
      "content": "Upload a video at least once a day. Your videos are more likely to be seen and shared if you are active on TikTok. Even if you aren't getting a lot of views, keep uploading; an active TikTok account will look more promising to followers than an account that rarely puts out new content."
    },
    {
      "title": "Interact on the platform.",
      "content": "Interact on the platform. Engage in the comments on your videos. Followers love to chat with their favorite content creators. Leave comments on other TikTok videos. People will most likely go to your account page if they see you interact within the community. Follow similar TikTok users to your own content. People who follow the person you follow will most likely end up on your profile page. Take part in challenge videos. You can either start your own challenge or you can take part in a challenge that's already ongoing. It's another way to get your content out there and viewed by the TikTok masses, which increases your chances of getting a follower."

    {
      "title": "Connect with other social media.",
      "content": "Connect with other social media. If you link your TikTok account with Facebook, your uploaded video is shared to more places and more people. The people in those other social media platforms will also have the opportunity to follow you on TikTok as well."

    {
      "title": "Collaborate with other people.",
      "content": "Collaborate with other people. If you work in a video with a popular TikTok video producer who has his own following, you are more likely to get views and follows from that crowd."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use press release agencies.",
      "content": "Use press release agencies. If you have a little bit of money to invest in your TikTok account, then absolutely get the help of a social media agency. The agency will write about your TikTok account and make sure to publish it on hundreds of popular news sites that get million of readers around the world."
