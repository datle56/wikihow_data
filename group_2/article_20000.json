      "content": "Get familiar with ticket retailers. VIP packages are a hot commodity and are likely to sell out fast. Familiarize yourself with various online ticket retailers to ensure you get the tickets you want. Make accounts with different websites to make the check-out process easier. Stay logged in while you're waiting for tickets to go on sale. Buying tickets online can sometimes be difficult. A lot of vendors give you a set amount of time to purchase tickets. If you run out of time, you have to start all over. It might be helpful to practice buying tickets to make sure you know how each website works. You don't have to buy anything, but you can still get familiar with the check-out process."

      "title": "Set some money aside for tickets.",
      "content": "Set some money aside for tickets. VIP packages are not cheap, and some are well over $1000. You may need to start saving well in advance to make sure you can afford the VIP package when it goes on sale. [5] X Research source Some events will cost quite a bit more than others. For example, if you want VIP tickets to a farewell tour, you're going to spend a lot more than if you were going to a standard show. Likewise, VIP tickets to a special sporting event, such as the Super Bowl, will be much harder to get than VIP tickets to a regular season game. Plan ahead to make sure you know how much, and how long, you have to save."

The good seats are usually the ones that sell the fastest, sometimes within the first few minutes. If you know that tickets go on sale at 10 AM, make sure you're logged in and ready to buy a few minutes before. [6] X Research source"
