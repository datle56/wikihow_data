      "title": "Hide your candy in layers.",
      "content": "Hide your candy in layers. The longer it takes to get to your candy, the harder it will be to find. For example, your sock drawer may not be a good idea. All someone has to do is open up the drawer and see the candy. A better idea would be inside one of your socks. This way, whoever opens up your sock drawer won't be able to see your candy right away—they will have to dig through your socks first."

      "title": "Make your candy hard to get to.",
      "content": "Make your candy hard to get to. Similar to hiding your candy in layers, the longer it takes to get to your candy, the less likely someone will find it. Great places include under your clothes in a drawer, far under your bed, in a box at the very top of your shelf, and so forth."

    {
      "title": "Hide your candy in different spots.",
      "content": "Hide your candy in different spots. The saying \"don't put all of your eggs into one basket\" exists for a reason. If you hide all of your candy in one spot, and someone finds it, you might end up with no candy. Try to hide your candy in at least two different places. Don't hide your candy too close together. For example, if you have some candy tucked away into your socks in one drawer, don't hide the rest of your candy in the next drawer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't hide your candy in places that get warm.",
      "content": "Don't hide your candy in places that get warm. This includes next to windows, near heaters, or close to lights. The reason for this is simple: candy melts if it gets hot, especially chocolate. A good hiding place won't be of much use to you if you can't eat the candy later on. Not to mention, melted candy can create a mess, and messes attract attention."

    {
      "title": "Skip the obvious hiding places.",
      "content": "Skip the obvious hiding places. Lockers, safes, and piggy banks are all popular hiding places—and this means that they are obvious hiding places. Shoe boxes that say \"TOP SECRET\" or \"KEEP OUT\" are also bad choices, because they draw attention and curiosity. Your friends and siblings would be more likely to go through these boxes. However, you can always hide it in your suitcase or backpack or somewhere similar."

      "content": "Try using what you have at home. You don't have to make a secret cubby to hide your candy. You can use what you have in your room, such as a sock drawer or tissue box. This section will give you a few ideas on where you can hide candy in your room."

      "title": "Hide your candy in the bottom of a tissue box.",
      "content": "Hide your candy in the bottom of a tissue box. Find a tissue box, then carefully lift out the entire stack of tissues. Place your candy in a thin layer along the bottom, then place the stack of tissues back. Pull out the first tissue—this will make it look like the tissues are \"in use.\""

      "title": "Try hiding your candy inside your pillowcase.",
      "content": "Try hiding your candy inside your pillowcase. This only works for a short while, and you have to take the candy out before you go to sleep. Keep the candy on the bottom of the pillow case—the side that is touching the mattress. If you put it in the top, the candy will make lumps, and give your secret away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hide candy inside your clothes.",
      "content": "Hide candy inside your clothes. Find a shirt that you never use, and hide the candy in it. Place the shirt neatly back in your drawer. It would be best to use a shirt that you don't wear often. For example, if it is summer, hide your candy in a winter shirt or a sweater. If it is winter, hide the candy in one of your summer shirts. Another great hiding spot is inside of a pair of socks. Coat pockets make great hiding places too!"

      "content": "Camouflage the candy. Candy and toys are both brightly-colored. If you have a bin where you keep lots of small, plastic toys, you can hide some small, brightly-colored candies in the bottom of that bin. The bright colors of your toys will help camouflage the bright colors of the candy."

      "content": "Throw the wrappers away outside your home. If you have a trashcan in your room or home, don't throw the wrappers away in that. If someone sees candy wrappers in the trashcan, they will suspect that you are hiding candy in your room. Instead, throw the candy away at school (or hide it underneath other things in the trash)."

      "title": "Don't brag.",
      "content": "Don't brag. If you brag about hiding candy in your room, someone may go looking for it. If you have any siblings, it might be a good idea to keep your candy stash secret from them. If they get mad at you, they may tell on you. They may also get careless and accidentally give your secret away."

    {
      "title": "Act natural.",
      "content": "Act natural. Don't get nervous, especially if someone is close to one of your hiding spots. For example, if someone opens the sock drawer where you hid your candy, don't scream \"Don't open that!\" or \"Don't look in there!\" This will tell the other person that you are hiding something, and they will get suspicious and look through your sock drawer."

      "content": "Don't draw attention to your candy stash. People tend to look where other people are looking. If someone is with you in your room, and you keep looking at your secret stash, the other person may get curious. They may even try to look wherever you are looking and find your candy."

      "content": "Rotate your hiding places. The longer something sits in one place, the more likely someone will find it sooner or later.

It might be a good idea to paint the glue on with a paintbrush. If you use too much glue, your paper will get soggy. If you are using a cereal box, cut out the front or back first, then put the glue on the cardboard side. The image size will be on the back from now on."
