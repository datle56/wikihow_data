[3] X Research source Answer: Yes. Explanation: If Emma is married, she’s married and looking at Guy, who’s unmarried. If Emma is un married, then Robert (who is married) is looking at her. In either case, there is a married person looking at an unmarried one."

Explanation: The “day before tomorrow” is today, and the “day before two days after” is really just one day after. So, simplified, the statement would read “one day after today is Saturday.” One day after Saturday is Friday, which gives us our answer."

Answer & Explanation: Tilt the barrel until the wine just touches the barrel’s lip. If they can see the bottom of the barrel, then it’s less than half full. If they can’t see the bottom of the barrel because it’s still covered by wine, then it’s more than half full."

The tallest man is in the back and can see the heads of the two in front of him; the middle man can see the one man in front of him; the man in front can't see anyone. They are blindfolded, and hats are placed on their heads, picked from three black hats and two white hats. The extra two hats are hidden, and the blindfolds are removed. The tallest man is asked if he knows what color hat he's wearing; he doesn't. The middle man is asked if he knows; he doesn't. But the man in front, who can't see anyone, says he knows. How does he know, and what color hat is he wearing? [5] X Research source Answer: Black. Explanation: The man in the front knew that he and the middle man aren’t both wearing white hats. Otherwise, the man in the back would’ve known that he had a black hat (since there are only two white hats). The man in the front also knows that the middle man didn’t see with a white hat because, if he did, the middle man would’ve known that he himself was wearing a black hat. As a result, the front man knows that his hat must be black."

      "content": "There are three crates, one with mangos, one with coconuts and one with both mangos and coconuts mixed. Each crate is closed and labeled with one of three labels: “Mangos,” “Coconuts,” or “Mangos and Coconuts.” The label maker broke and labeled all of the crates incorrectly. How could you pick just one fruit from one crate to figure out what's in each crate? [6] X Research source Answer: Pick a fruit from the crate marked “Mangos and Coconuts.” Explanation: If you pick a mango, then you know that that crate should be labeled as “Mangos” because all of the crates are marked incorrectly as of now. So, the crate marked “Mangos” must be “Coconuts”—if it were labeled as “Mangos and Coconuts,” then the “Coconuts” crate would be labeled correctly, which we know isn’t the case. The one marked “Coconuts” is “Mangos and Coconuts.” On the other hand, if you pick a coconut from the crate, then you know that the crate should be marked “Coconuts”, the one marked “Coconuts” must be “Mangos,” and the one marked “Mangos” must be “Mangos and Coconuts.”"

      "content": "A teacher writes six words on a board: \"cat dog has max dim tag.\" She gives three students, Aurora, Belle, and Cindy, each a piece of paper with one letter from one of the words and explains that together, their letters spell one of the words. She asks, \"Aurora, do you know the word?\" Aurora immediately replies yes. She asks, \"Belle, do you know the word?\" Belle thinks for a moment and replies, \"Yes.\" Then, the teacher asks Cindy the same question. She thinks and then replies, \"Yes.\" What is the word? [7] X Research source Answer: “Dog.” Explanation: Aurora knows because she has one of the unique letters that only appears once in all the words: c, o, h, s, x, i. (In this case, it’s “o.”) None of these letters appear in “tag,” so that word is eliminated. All of these unique letters appear in different words, except for the “h” and “s” in “has.” Using this logic, Belle can then figure out what the word is based on the leftover unique letters: t, g, h, s. This eliminates “max” and “dim.” Thus, Belle has “g.” Cindy can then figure out the word because there’s only one unique letter left (“d”), so the word must be “dog.”"

      "content": "You are given three doors to choose from, one of which contains a car, and the other two contain goats. After you've chosen one but haven't opened it, Monty, who knows where everything is, reveals the location of a goat from behind one of the other two doors. Should you stick with your original choice or switch if you want the car? [8] X Research source Answer: Switch. Explanation: At the beginning, you have a 1 in 3 chance of picking the car—the two doors with the goats have ⅔ of the chance. However, because Monty knows and shows you where one of the goats is, the ⅔ chance is placed solely on the third door. So, the odds are better if you switch."

      "content": "Clementine put Maude in a room with three light switches. Maude had to figure out which light was controlled by each switch. All of the lights, however, were in the room next door. The switches in the room were all off, and Maude was only allowed to turn them on or off when the door was closed. The door blocked all of the light coming in from the other room. Once she opened the door, she was no longer able to turn on or off any of the light switches. Assuming that all the lights were working, how did Maude figure it out? [9] X Research source Answer & Explanation: Mauve should turn on the first two light switches and water for a few minutes. Then, she should turn off the second switch and open the door to go into the room. Looking at the two lights that are off, she feels each bulb to see which one is warm or hot. She’ll know which switch controls each light by observing: which light is on (controlled by the first switch); which light is warm to the touch (controlled by the second switch); and which light is cold or not warm (controlled by the third switch)."

He gives you the choice of whether or not he should spin the chambers again before firing a second time. Should he spin again? [10] X Research source Answer: Yes. Explanation: Before he spins, there’s a 1 in 6 chance of a bullet being fired. Once he spins, however, one of those chances is taken away, creating a 1 in 5 chance that a bullet will be fired. So, it’s better to spin again for a reduced chance of a bullet being fired."

He gives you the choice of whether or not he should spin the chambers again before firing a second time. Should you tell him to spin the chambers again? Answer: No. Explanation: When you have 2 bullets, you have a 2 in 6 (or 1 in 3) chance to get hit with a bullet before the assassin fires the first time. We know that the empty shot in the previous round was one of four empty chambers, leaving four positions that the gun could now be in, only one of which would emit a bullet. Therefore, you have a 1 in 4 chance that the second round will fire. 1 in 4 is better odds than 1 in 3, so you should tell him not to shoot again."

If it is false, you will be killed by the trampling of wild buffalo. If I can't figure it out, I'll have to let you go.\" Sure enough, the man was released. What was the man's statement? [11] X Research source Answer: “I will be killed by the trampling of wild buffalo.” Explanation: If this statement is true, the man will be killed by lions, which would make the statement not true. If it’s a lie, he’d be killed by wild buffalo, making the statement true. The king couldn’t figure out a solution, so he had to let the man live."

[13] X Research source Answer: Go to the one with the messy hair. Explanation: It’s safe to assume that these barber’s cut one another’s hair, meaning that the barber with the messy cut must have cut the neat trim on the other barber’s head. This means that he’s more skilled and a better choice for your cut."

Their names include both of their parents’ initials, but none of the other letters in their parents’ first names. What will Ruby and Lewis name their triplets? [14] X Research source Answer: Arnold, Roland, and Ronald. Explanation: These three names are all boy names. Each one is six letters long and is an anagram of the other two names. All three names include “R” and “L,” the parents’ initials, but the other letters in their parents’ names (U, B, Y, E, W, I, S) are not present."

How many socks must he take out to make 100 percent certain he has at least one pair of black socks? [15] X Research source Answer: He must take out 40 socks. Explanation: If he removes 38 socks (the sum of the two biggest groups: 21 and 17), then it’s possible that they’re all light blue and red (not black). To make sure that he also has a pair of black socks, he must take out two more socks, making 40 total."

(You can light one or both ropes at one or both ends at the same time.) [16] X Research source Answer & Explanation: Both ropes burn inconsistently, so you can’t light one and wait until it’s 75% burned. Instead, you should simultaneously light the first rope at both ends and the second one at one end. The first rope will take 30 minutes to burn, since it’s burning at the same pace from both ends. Once the first rope goes out, light the other end of the second rope. Since the second rope has already been burning for 30 minutes, the remaining rope will take another 30. Lighting it from both ends will halve that time to 15 minutes, giving you 45 minutes total."

If we work backward and divide 25 by 5, you’ll get five minutes for one cat to catch each mouse."

You pick a random bag and take out one marble, which is white. What is the probability that the remaining marble from the same bag is also white? [18] X Research source Answer: 2 out of 3. Explanation: We know that we don’t have Bag B. Bag A has two white marbles, so we could pick either marble in the bag. If you consider the marbles from Bag A and Bag C as a total count of four marbles (3 white and 1 black), you’ll have a better chance of picking another white marble."

[19] X Research source Answer: “Which direction do you live in?” Explanation: If you ask this question and the person is from the City of Lies, then they will lie and point to the City of Truth. If they’re from the City of Truth, they’ll tell the truth and also point to the City of Truth. Either way, you get your answer!"

The unicorn tells the truth the rest of the week but lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The lion confessed to the girl, “Yesterday I was lying.” So was I, the unicorn said. When is it today? [20] X Research source Answer: Thursday. Explanation: The lion is telling the truth today so must have been lying yesterday. That means that today must be Thursday. Similarly, the unicorn was lying on Thursday and spoke the truth Tuesday. So, when he says that he lied yesterday, that’s a lie (because he lies on Thursdays)."

Cordelia says that she is the spy. Who is the knight, who’s the knave, and who’s the spy? [21] X Research source Answer: Astrid is the knight, Beatriz is the spy, and Cordelia is the knave. Explanation: We know that Beatriz must be lying because, if she was telling the truth, we’d have two knights. So, that means that Beatriz must be either the knave or the spy. Cordelia also cannot be the knight because her statement would then be a lie. By process of elimination, we then know that Astrid is the knight, meaning Beatriz is the spy (because the spy sometimes tells the truth), and Cordelia is the knave."

      "content": "You meet three gods on a mountaintop. One always tells the truth, one always lies and one tells the truth or lies randomly. They understand English but answer in their own language, with ja or da for yes and no. We’ll call them Truth, False, and Random—but you don't know which is which. You can ask three questions to any of the gods (and you can ask the same god more than one question), and they will answer with ja or da . What three questions do you ask to figure out who's who? [22] X Research source Warning: This problem is often called the hardest logic puzzle ever . Answer & Explanation: Start by thinking of a hypothetical question that you know the answer to, like “Does two plus two equal four?” Then, phrase the question like an embedded question—“If I asked you if 2 plus 2 equals 4, would you answer ja ?” If ja means “yes,” then Truth would answer ja , but so would False. If ja means “no,” then both would still answer ja . Random’s answer would be meaningless because we don’t know whether he lies or tells the truth. Then, consider if you said something like, \"If I asked you if two plus two equals five, would you answer ja ?\" If ja means “yes,” Truth and False would both answer da . If ja means “no,” then they’d also both answer “da.” So, you know that, if the embedded question is correct, then Truth and False would always answer with whatever word you used. If the embedded question is incorrect, they’ll always answer with the opposite word of what you said. Now that you’ve determined the logic of these questions, ask the middle god your first question: \"If I asked you whether the god on my left is Random, would you answer ja?\" If the god answers ja and you’re talking to either Truth or False, you know that the embedded question is correct and that the god to the left is Random. It’s possible that you just asked Random the question, but you still know that the god on the right is not Ransom. If the answer is da , then you know that the god on the left is not random. Now, ask the god that you definitely know isn’t Random a question with the same structure, e.g., \"If I were to ask you if you are Truth, would you say ja ?\" If they answer ja , you know you’re talking to Truth. If they answer with da , you know you’re talking to False. Once you’ve identified a god as True or False, ask the same god a final question: \"If I asked you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?” From the answer to this question, you can use the process of elimination to identify Random."

How can the farmer bring the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river without eating anything? [23] X Research source Answer & Explanation: The farmer must first take the goat across the river. Then, he returns alone and takes the wolf across but returns with the goat.

[24] X Research source Answer & Explanation: Chelsea and Dusty row across first, with a combined weight of 100 kg (220 lb). Dusty returns. Amelia then rows over, and Chelsea returns. Chelsea and Dusty row across again, and Dusty returns. Björn rows across with the supplies (a combined weight of 100 kg (220 lb)). Chelsea then returns before rowing across again with Dusty.
