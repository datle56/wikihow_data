One piece will end up being the one with tabs and the pop-up image. This will fit inside the other piece which will be the front and back of the card.

      "content": "Make 2 cuts in the center of the card that are 1-inch long. Take one of the folded pieces of paper and keep it folded in half. Make 2 parallel cuts that are 1-inch (2.5 cm) long through the folded side of the paper. The cuts should be in the center of the card so the pop-up image is centered. These tabs should work for images that are 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) in size. Take the size of your pop-up image into account. For example, if your pop up is large, you'll probably need a bigger tab."

Run your fingers along the fold of the card so that it's firmly creased. Crease the tab section in the opposite direction so it pops out and away from the card. [3] X Research source"

For example, use a gift shape, a cut-out of a person's name, a heart, or a small school photo. Cut out your pop-up shape and ensure that it will fit in your card.

Rub a glue stick or lay double-sided tape across both sides of the paper when it's unfolded. Open the card with the pop-up image and set it into the adhesive. Press down firmly and let it dry completely. [6] X Research source The second piece of paper will hide the tab so you can't see that the card is a pop-up until you open it."

If you want to make a simple card, take a piece of heavy, decorative paper and fold it in half. Most cards are folded widthwise, although you can fold it lengthwise to make a tall card. The card should be heavy enough to support the pop-up image."

      "content": "Draw the pop-up image on a separate piece of decorative paper. Get out a piece of decorative paper or use a scrap of decorative paper large enough for your image. Use a pen or pencil to draw the image you'd like to pop up on the paper. You could also use printed images or photographs as long as you cut them to fit in the card. For example, take a photograph and cut the part of the picture you want into a decorative shape. Cut out shapes that match the theme of the card. For example, cut out or print flowers for a graduation card, use a cake image for a wedding, or use a picture of balloons for a birthday."

      "content": "Draw small tabs on the sides of your pop-up image. Depending on the size and shape of your image, draw a long thin rectangle on each of its sides. You'll fold back this rectangle to make a tab that attaches to the card. Each rectangle tab should be at least 1 to 2 centimeters wide, so you can fold them. If you prefer, you could fold the image itself instead of adding tabs."

[7] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Ensure that you keep them in a single piece. If you accidentally cut the tabs out, you can still use them. You'll just need to glue the tabs the back of the image and glue them into the card. If you're making a detailed image, you can set it down on a cutting mat. Then use a utility knife to cut around the image."

      "content": "Fold the tabs back to make a V-fold. Locate the tabs that you left on the sides of your image. Fold them back behind the image, so you can't see them anymore. If you accidentally cut them earlier, use glue or a glue stick to apply them to the back and sides of the image. If you prefer, you can even fold back the sides of the image itself. For example, if you're making a heart, folding back the sides will just make the heart appear longer."

Open your card and lay it flat. Place your pop-up image in the center and push down firmly on the tabs so the double-sided tape sticks in place. Close the card and open it to check that the image pops out. While you can use glue, it may leak out the sides. Tape is easier to handle and won't be visible."
