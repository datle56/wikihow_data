Once you’ve creased that fold, fold it upward again so that the top of the first fold is in the crease of the second fold. Each fold should be the same length as the last fold. Repeat these folds until you’ve folded the whole paper into a narrow strip about 3 cm (1.2 in) wide. [1] X Research source"

Trim 0.6 cm (¼ in) from the ends of this strip so it is slightly shorter than the long strip. This smaller, shorter strip will be the lower part of your dragon’s jaw base. [4] X Research source"

Start by placing the folded strip on the paper like a V, with the point in the center of the paper and the open ends at the paper’s bottom edge. Place your palm in this upside-down V (pressing your fingers together, leaving your thumb out) to make sure it fits—if not, widen the V before tracing. Then, trace around the V and add about 1 cm (.4 in) of a rectangular border around both the long sides of the triangle. [5] X Research source Use a ruler to add the border if you’d like your lines to be straight. Or, freehand them—this border will be covered up by the V."

If you’re using tape, tape the rectangular borders to the inside of the V, leaving a gap between the top of the triangle so the tip of the V looks like an A.

Lay them flat so you can see inside the wedges. Make sure the smaller wedge is on the bottom. [10] X Research source Follow the below steps, depending on what you’re using to join them. Tape: Tape the wedges together at the place where the wedges touch (the central line). Use several strips of tape to reinforce. Then, pull the top wedge back like you’re opening the jaw, and add more strips of tape to the middle line where the wedges are touching (what would be the back of your dragon’s throat). [11] X Research source Glue stick: Take another sheet of A4 paper and cut out two small squares (7.6 cm/3 in). Fold the squares in half (creating folded rectangles) and hold them together at the crease. Trim the corners inward/upward so the folded rectangles look like trapezoids. Unfold (now you have two hexagons) and glue one hexagon to the place where the wedges touch (the central line). The crease of the hexagon should be lined up with this central line, like a hinge. Open the jaw. Glue the second hexagon so that its crease is lined up with the back of your dragon’s throat, where the wedges meet in the middle."

Sketch these heights to make two parallel rectangles a few centimeters longer than the jaw base. [12] X Research source Leave about 5 cm/2 in between the rectangles, and 10 cm/4 in of paper space above the top rectangle. The bottom rectangle will be the dragon’s bottom jaw, and the top rectangle will be the dragon’s top jaw—but you’ll need the extra space on top to add the rest of the dragon’s face."

Make sure the top jaw design pieces slightly cover the lower jaw pieces so you can still open the mouth. Congratulations, your puppet is complete! [16] X Research source Tape: If desired, you can create another design piece to cover the top front area of your paper dragon puppet. To do so, take a piece of A4 paper. Trace around the puppet’s bottom jaw (with the puppet upright, not sideways) to create a small triangle. Draw a design that matches the top/front of the dragon’s design. Cut out the triangle and trim to fit in the middle front section of the puppet. Carefully tape it in place."

Search “paper dragon puppet” or “paper dragon design.” As many artists note in their videos, you shouldn’t steal their designs. Instead, use them as a jumping-off point for your own creative expression. You can also look at dragon art as well as paper dragon puppets to find color combinations and styles that you like. Sites like Etsy have printable dragon puppet design templates for sale. This is ideal for parents who want to make this craft with younger children, or teachers who want their students to create paper dragon puppets using templates. Of course, it costs nothing to draw your own dragon designs—and you’ll have more control over the final design that way! Looking for an easier puppet craft? Consider making a simple paper puppet .
