[2] X Expert Source Julie Wright, MFT Parenting & Baby Sleep Specialist Expert Interview. 6 March 2020. A baby with an ear infection may be more comfortable being held. They may need to be propped up on a pillow or have a wedge placed under their crib mattress so that they are not lying down in a completely flat position. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your child’s ears have fluid in them from the infection, then lying flat on their back will cause pressure that feels like all the air has just been sucked out of the room. Propping your child up will help the Eustachian tubes in their ears to clear out, and it will relieve some of the pressure."

      "content": "Give your child something to drink to clear the fluid from their ears. Ear infections may cause pain and/or discomfort when eating or drinking so it may sound strange to recommend giving your child a drink. However, drinking a few sips of water or juice can help to stimulate the muscles in and near the Eustachian tubes in your child’s ears. [4] X Research source When these muscles are stimulated, they can clear the fluid out of your child’s ears more efficiently. That means that the tubes in your child’s ears can open and begin to clear; this will help to reduce your child’s pain and allow them to sleep more soundly."

      "content": "Limit the amount of dairy your child consumes. If at all possible, try to limit the amount of milk and dairy that your baby consumes when they have an ear infection. Dairy products increase the mucus in your child’s body and make it hard for the tubes to drain fluids away effectively."

      "content": "Get a prescription for your child. When you notice that your child is in pain, contact your pediatrician right away. They will be able to diagnose the ear infection and prescribe medication that will help your child to overcome the infection. Your pediatrician will most likely prescribe antibiotics, and possibly some pain medication. Follow the doctor’s orders when giving your child the medication.

Because children have a hard time expressing what they are feeling, it is up to you to figure out when your child needs a doctor. Trust your instincts; if your baby does not look or act as if they feel well, you should consider taking them to the doctor."

      "content": "Understand that some medications will make your child sleepy. Many times, pain relievers will relax your child so that they will fall asleep. Sometimes the pain relievers will have something in them that may even help your child to become sleepy. If this is the case, your baby may be sleepy for a couple of days as the medication works its way through their system."

      "content": "Hold your child and let them know that you are here for them. When a baby has an ear infection, they may become confused by the pain and therefore become scared.

When you are trying to put your child to sleep, they will probably begin to feel their ear pain even more intensely. To combat this, try telling your child a story, or singing them several songs while they fall asleep.

      "content": "Try rocking your child but stop if they complain. While rocking can generally help a baby fall asleep, the back-and-forth movement may not help a child with an ear infection. This is because that rocking movement can move the fluid in your child’s ears around, causing pain.

If you are stressed out by your child’s pain, your child will sense your stress and will most likely find it more difficult to fall asleep.
