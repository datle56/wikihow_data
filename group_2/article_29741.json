      "content": "You’re not feeling well. A simple “I’m feeling sick” can work wonders when trying to cancel plans. Maybe you have a sore throat, stomachache, or temperature. No matter the case, you just don’t think you’ll be up to hanging out. Trying saying something like, “I have to cancel our plans today. I have a sore throat and haven’t been feeling well. I’m so sorry!” Pro tip: When making this excuse, ensure you’re not going out or posting lively content on social media that they might see, as this can unravel your lie."

      "content": "You have a prior commitment. Maybe something came up with a friend or you have family plans you can’t get out of. Either way, there’s no way you’ll be able to make the date now. [1] X Research source You could say, “I forgot I made plans to help a friend move, and I’m the only one able to help out right now. I hate to have to cancel on you, but I can't get out of it!” or “I forgot that I promised my niece I’d go to her dance recital. Could I ask for a rain check for tonight?”"

      "content": "You’re double-booked. It could be very likely that you overlooked something on your calendar and double-booked the day—it happens! When used correctly, this excuse can be very believable. You don’t need to share a lot of excuses, but ensure you lay out your intentions (especially about a possible follow-up date). You might say, “I have a doctor’s appointment when we were supposed to meet up. I totally forgot! Can we make a new plan?” or “I completely forgot I’m supposed to dog sit on Friday. Can we circle back on meeting up?”"

      "content": "You have the wrong date or time. Everyone’s made a mix-up in their schedule at least once, so make up an excuse around yours. Perhaps you thought the date was next Saturday, not this Saturday, and wrote it in your calendar wrong. This excuse is great to use if you’d still like to meet at a different time. Try saying something like, “I didn’t realize our date was this Friday! I had it on my calendar for next Friday. Could we reschedule?” or “I got the dates mixed up for our date and won’t be able to make it anymore.”"

If you have a demanding job, consider using this excuse to cancel plans (just be sure not to use it too often). [2] X Research source You could tell them, “I’m so sorry to change our plans, but this is our busy season at work, and I have to do catch up all weekend.”"

      "content": "You’re dealing with family drama. Everyone can relate to family drama, so use that to your advantage! Come up with a scenario where you have to help out a family member or be a mediator of sorts. This excuse is great to use on someone you don’t really know all that well yet. Try saying something like, “I’m having to help my mom deal with a scam issue…long story. I won’t be able to meet up tonight. I’m so sorry!”"

Emergencies can pop up at any time, no matter where you live, so use that to your advantage. Just be sure that who you’re cancelling on won’t want to run over and save the day. For example, “My freezer decided to call it quits just before I walked out the door. I’m not going to be able to make it tonight.”"

Either way, you don’t think you’re going to be able to make the date after all. Just make sure your excuse doesn’t indicate that you’ll be tardy for the date but that you actually have to cancel. You might say, “I’m stuck in traffic and won’t make it home till late, and I still have to get the dogs settled. Can we reschedule?”"

Either way, you’re not up for socializing. Think about what’s best for you and your mood, and go from there. You could say, “I’ll be honest, I had a really rough day, and the idea of going out again is stressing me out. I don’t want to put you in a bad mood. Could we cancel tonight?”"

      "content": "You’re emotionally drained. Not being emotionally available is a valid excuse to cancel any plan. You may be feeling burnt out, stressed, or overwhelmed, and the idea of going out is just too much. Remember, it’s important to take care of your own needs, too. Try saying something like, “It’s been a long day at work, and I’m not feeling the best emotionally. Could we reschedule? I want to be in a better mood when I see you.”"

You might say, “I think you’re great, but I’m just not emotionally available to date right now,” or “I’m not up for dating right now, but I’d love to hang out and be friends!” If you’re interested in someone else, you could say, “I have feelings for someone else, and I can’t really see past those at this time.”"

      "content": "Make your excuse believable. If you’re trying to get out of a date, make sure your excuse is based on partial truths. You don’t have to lie completely—just stretch the truth a little bit. Come up with an excuse that fits your lifestyle and current situation. This way, they won’t be too suspicious. [4] X Research source For example, say you have a little brother. You could make an excuse that you have to pick him up from school or babysit last minute."

      "content": "Think of a low-risk excuse. The premise of your excuse needs to carry weight but also not be too demanding. Aim to make your excuse simple and ensure it doesn’t involve follow-up questions or actions. Making up a sick loved one, for example, might carry too much weight and come back to haunt you."

This is simply the polite and courteous thing to do, especially when canceling plans. You might say, “I’m so sorry to cancel, but I’ve been feeling really down and don’t think I’m up to spending time with anyone.” Bilotta recommends “trying to make your reasoning about you rather than about them. Use ‘I’ statements to preserve their feelings. Don’t make it about them.” [5] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 7 July 2020."

If you say you have conflicting plans with a friend, ensure they don’t message the person you canceled on. Simply put, make sure all of your ducks are in a row so nothing backfires on you."

Have there truly been red flags, or are you fearing the possible commitment? Do a bit of self-reflection to ensure you make the right decision for you.

Dating and relationship coach Julianne Cantarella advises that if you don’t want to reschedule, don’t make a suggestion too. Avoid suggesting seeing them again or staying in touch.

Always make sure to apologize for having to change plans, whether you’d like to reschedule or not. After all, it’s the nice thing to do!

If you say you were with someone else, you risk them spilling the beans. Instead, tell a simple lie without many details, or ensure that the person involved in your lie is aware of any made-up plans or excuses. For example, try reframing excuses to be centered around you when possible. Instead of saying, “Carly was feeling sad, so I have to spend the day with her,” try, “I’m not feeling well, so I think I’m going to stay home.\""

Bite the bullet and cancel as soon as you’re sure you don’t want to go through with it. Now, there’s nothing wrong with canceling at the last minute, especially if that’s when you know for sure. But do your best to avoid it when possible. Whether you cancel ahead of time or last minute, make sure your excuse matches the time frame. For example, a work meeting popping up may happen days in advance, while a broken fridge can happen at the last minute."
