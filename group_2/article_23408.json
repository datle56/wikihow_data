      "content": "Take note of the spider’s length. Trapdoor spiders are approximately 0.79 in to 1.26 inches (1 to 3 cm) long. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source That means roughly between the size of your pinky nail and your thumbnail."

      "content": "Look at the spider’s body. Trapdoor spiders are black or brown, with stout bodies and legs. Some species have paler color markings, or they may have a silky covering of hair. Their bodies are divided into two sections: the thorax (containing the head and legs) and the abdomen. [5] X Research source The abdomen is typically lighter and a slightly different color. Though they may be difficult to see because of its small size, a trapdoor spider will have 6 eyes arranged in 3 groups, whereas most other spiders have 8 eyes. [6] X Research source Trapdoor spiders are relatives of tarantulas, but are less hairy, and have smaller, shinier bodies. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for gender differences.",
      "content": "Look for gender differences. Females trapdoor spiders are larger than the males, but you will seldom see females because they rarely leave their burrows. [10] X Research source Therefore, if you see a trapdoor spider, it is most likely a male. Look for these characteristics that identify male trapdoor spiders: Short and blunt spinnerets. These produce silk, and are located at the tip of the abdomen. [11] X Research source A double spur about halfway along their front legs. A dusty or dull carapace (a harder area covering much of the thorax) that is lightly covered in bristles.

If you think you have seen a trapdoor spider, look up the specific varieties that live in your area, so that you know can what kind of specific markings to expect."

Various species of trapdoor spiders can be found all over the world.

      "content": "Recognize the signs of a trapdoor spider burrow. Trapdoor spiders burrow in the ground (about 0.75 inches wide and up to 8 inches deep) and cover their burrow with a silken hinged “trapdoor” camouflaged by sticks, pebbles, and other natural material. [16] X Research source [17] X Research source Because the burrows are camouflaged, they can be very hard to see. Larger burrows may have multiple trapdoors. Usually, the burrow faces sunlight and will be found near vegetation."

      "title": "Look for trapdoor spider food.",
      "content": "Look for trapdoor spider food. Trapdoor spiders are shy, may be nocturnal, and are rarely seen far from their burrows (males may wander during mating season, however). [18] X Research source You might be able to spy one, however, when it eats. The spiders will wait in their burrows until they sense vibrations in the ground caused by insects (including crickets, moths, beetles, and grasshoppers) and other spiders. Then, the spiders will leap out of the trapdoor, grab one of these animals, and drag it back into the burrow."
