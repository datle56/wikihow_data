      "content": "Wait up to 2 weeks for the injury to heal. Popped blood vessels are harmless and almost always clear up on their own. Keep track of when the bleeding first started, so you can keep tabs on the healing process over several days. Although this injury isn’t very flattering, it’s easiest to let your eye heal at its own pace. [5] X Research source There’s no treatment that will speed up or improve how your eye looks. If needed, you can use over-the-counter treatments if your eye feels irritated."
