      "title": "Get a set of jewelry pliers and cutters.",
      "content": "Get a set of jewelry pliers and cutters. For most basic wire jewelry projects, you will need a set of wire cutters, some round-nosed pliers, and some chain-nosed pliers. You can purchase these tools at most arts and crafts stores or jewelry and beading supply stores. Other useful tools include bent-nosed pliers for fine detail work and flat-edged pliers for making sharp angles in your wire."

      "title": "Pick the wire color and material you like best.",
      "content": "Pick the wire color and material you like best. The most common colors for jewelry wire are silver, gold, or copper, but you can also get color-coated wire in every imaginable shade. Different types of wire also have different properties, so keep this in mind when making your selection. Base-metal wires (such as copper or stainless steel) or alloys (like brass or nickel silver) are relatively inexpensive. These are good options when you are still learning to work with wire. Popular precious metal jewelry wire materials include sterling silver, gold, and gold-filled (an alloy with a gold coating). Sterling silver tends to tarnish, while gold does not. Gold is softer and easier to dent or scratch, however. Memory wire retains its coiled shape, so it's great for making simple beaded bracelets or chokers."

      "title": "Purchase wire in a variety of gauges.",
      "content": "Purchase wire in a variety of gauges. Depending on the piece you are making, you may need thicker or thinner wire, or a combination of thicknesses. The lower the gauge number of the wire, the thicker it is. High-gauge wires are good for elaborate coils and weaves, while low-gauge wire is best for sturdier elements like links and clasps. For example, you might use a 28-gauge wire for a delicate wire crochet bracelet. If you wanted to make a heavy-duty clasp for a necklace, 10-gauge would be a better bet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose harder wire for the best shape retention.",
      "content": "Choose harder wire for the best shape retention. Most jewelry wire comes in 3 different levels of hardness: dead soft, half hard, and full hard. Softer wires are easier to bend than harder wires, but do not hold their shape as well as harder wires. [1] X Research source Dead soft wire is best for delicate work that requires a lot of flexibility, such as wire weaving or wire crochet. The wire will naturally begin to stiffen as you work with it. Dead soft wire can also be useful for making findings or other elements from very thick wire that would otherwise be difficult to shape. When you're done, you can tap all over the finished wire shape a few times with a rubber mallet on a steel plate to harden (temper) it. Full hard wire is difficult to bend and can snap easily if you stress it too much. It is the best at retaining its shape, however. Half hard wire is relatively easy to shape and also retains its shape well. This kind of wire is good for creating sturdy links and load-bearing elements."

      "title": "Buy prefabricated findings to make your projects easier.",
      "content": "Buy prefabricated findings to make your projects easier. Jewelry findings are elements like clasps, connectors, chains, and pins. You can purchase findings in arts and crafts or jewelry supply stores. You can incorporate pre-made findings into your hand-made pieces to add extra flair and make your job a little easier. For example, you can make a unique necklace by attaching beads to a prefabricated chain with wrapped wire links. Decorative chandelier earring findings make great bases for elegant wire-wrapped bead earrings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select a medium-gauge wire.",
      "content": "Select a medium-gauge wire. Since links are load-bearing elements, you'll need a wire that is thick enough to be relatively sturdy. A 20-gauge half-hard wire is typically a good choice. [2] X Research source Using half hard wire (as opposed to dead soft) can also help strengthen your links. If you're using beads, make sure the wire is thin enough to go through the drill holes. For very tiny beads, you may need a higher gauge."

      "title": "Snip off the very end of the wire with the flush side of your cutters.",
      "content": "Snip off the very end of the wire with the flush side of your cutters. Take the length of wire you are working with and clip off a very small amount of wire from the end to make a flat edge. The flat (flush) edge of the wire clippers should face the length of wire you will be working with (rather than the end you are snipping off). [3] X Research source You will be using this flat end of the wire to make your loop. If you like, you can make your loop in the wire while it is still on the roll, or you can cut off a longer length of wire (e.g., around 12 inches (30 cm)) to work with. If you do cut a piece off the roll, don't cut it too short, or you may end up without enough wire to make your link. If you're making a loop at the end of a prefabricated finding, such as a head pin, you probably will not need to cut off any of the wire."

      "title": "Pinch the end of the wire with your round-nosed pliers.",
      "content": "Pinch the end of the wire with your round-nosed pliers. Gently grasp the very end of the wire between the ends of your pliers. The wire should be flush with the pliers, so that you can't see the end extending beyond the pliers when you look at them in profile. [4] X Research source Round-nosed pliers have tapered ends, so position the end of the wire closer to the base if you want a bigger loop and nearer to the tip if you want a tighter loop. Take care not to squeeze the wire too tightly, or you may dent it. You only need to exert enough pressure to hold the wire in place."

      "title": "Roll the end of the wire away from you gently to form a loop.",
      "content": "Roll the end of the wire away from you gently to form a loop. Once the wire is securely in place, turn the hand holding the pliers away from you so that the wire begins to wrap around one of the jaws of the pliers. Press the wire against the pliers with the thumb of your free hand as you do this. Once you've turned your wrist as far as it will go, reposition the pliers within the loop so that you can turn them again. Do this until you have a complete loop. [5] X Research source When you reposition the pliers, make sure the wire is still about the same distance from the base of the pliers as it was when you started. Otherwise, your loop will be a little misshapen."

      "content": "Rock the loop back with the round-nose pliers to center the loop. When you're done wrapping the wire around the jaw of the pliers, you should have a “p” shape. In order to center the loop over the end of the wire, insert one of the jaws into the loop and gently pinch the wire right at the base of the loop. Grip the wire tightly at the base of the loop with your free hand and use the pliers to bend the wire back slightly so that the loop is centered over the length of the wire like the dot of an “i.” [6] X Research source If your wire is too thick to bend into place with the round-nose pliers, you may need to use chain-nose pliers instead."

      "content": "Use your chain-nose pliers to close the loop. After you complete the loop, there may be a small gap between the end of the loop and the rest of the wire. Grip the end of the loop with your chain-nose pliers and gently work it back and forth while pushing in until the gap is closed. [7] X Research source Don't try to squeeze the sides of the loop together from the outside, or you will end up with a squashed loop!"

      "title": "Make a wrapped loop for extra security.",
      "content": "Make a wrapped loop for extra security. For a completely closed loop with a slightly fancier appearance, use your chain-nose pliers to make a 90° bend in the wire about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end. Make a loop as you normally would just above the bend, this time leaving a “tail” that extends beyond the wire at a 90° angle. Wind the tail tightly around the wire below the bend 3-4 times. [8] X Research source When you're done, use your cutters to snip off any remaining tail. You can tighten the wrap by gently squeezing it at the top and bottom with your chain-nose pliers or your fingernails. This technique is easiest to do when you already have a bead on the wire. Grip the wire just above the bead when you make your 90° bend. This will leave a few millimeters of space between the bead and the loop around which to wrap the tail. You will not be able to open this loop once it is complete, so you'll need to attach it to an element you can open, such as a simple loop or a jump ring."

      "content": "String one or more beads on the wire if you like. If you wish, you can slide a bead onto the wire and then make a second loop on the other side. This way, you can link several beads together. You could also drop a bead onto a flat-ended head pin and make a loop above the bead. You can then add the bead to a chain or ear hook as a charm or bangle. Check online or in beading books or magazines for design inspirations using simple wire loops or wrapped links."

      "content": "Select a stone or other object to wrap. You can use just about anything—like a tumbled stone, a crystal, a piece of sea glass, a coin, or even a shell or shark tooth. For this project, you will be making a basket or cage around the object with wire to create a pendant that you can hang on a necklace. Objects that are somewhat irregularly shaped and widest in the middle are easiest to wrap using this technique. Most wrapped pendants are not much longer than about 2 inches (5.1 cm), but you are free to wrap a bigger object if you wish. Keep in mind that larger objects will need more wire to wrap them than smaller ones."

      "title": "Cut 2 equal lengths of medium-gauge wire.",
      "content": "Cut 2 equal lengths of medium-gauge wire. Choose a jewelry wire that is around 20-22 gauge and half hard. Since the wire will need to support the weight of the pendant, it's best to choose a relatively sturdy wire. The length you need will depend on the size of your pendant, but 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) is usually enough. [9] X Research source Snip the wires with the flush side of a wire clipper so that you get nice, clean cuts. If you're still practicing with wire wrapping, you may wish to use copper or another base metal rather than a more expensive precious metal wire. For heavier pendants, consider using thicker wire (e.g., 18 gauge instead of 20) to fully support their weight."

Pinch the wires where they cross with the index finger and thumb of each hand and give them 5 firm twists, turning your hands in opposite directions.

Pull the wire legs straight and parallel to each other at a roughly 90° angle from the twist to create an “H.” [11] X Research source You can straighten the wires by pulling them between your fingers in the desired direction. You'll be repeating this process several times as you make the pendant."

Choose the side that you wish to be either the front or back of your pendant and lay the twisted part of the wire flat against it. The twist should be oriented straight up and down and positioned roughly halfway between the top and bottom of the pendant. [12] X Research source Once the twist is in place, press the wires down along the surface of the pendant so that they follow the pendant's shape around to the opposite side."

Lay it flat against the pendant as you did before. Keep doing this on both sides until the entire pendant is contained, all the way to the top. [14] X Research source Your pendant should now be in a wire “cage” with 4 loose wires at the top. Adjust the cage as you go so that your pendant fits into it securely. You can do this by occasionally pushing the stone flush against the twists that you have already made and pulling the wires taut."

[16] X Research source Wind these wires slowly and carefully to make a strong, tight coil. If you wish, you can use chain nose pliers for greater control. It may help to draw the stray end of each wire taut with your pliers before snipping it off. Use the pliers to pinch down any ends that are sticking up after you snip the wires."

Be sure to make your wraps nice and tight. Remove the pencil when you're done, and you should have a secure bail for your pendant! [18] X Research source When you're done, snip off the ends of the wires and flatten them down with your chain-nose pliers. For a fancier look, make a small loop at the end of each wire with the very tip of your round-nose pliers.

For example, if you're making a simple woven ring, about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) is a good length. [19] X Research source If you wish, you can use the fine weaving wire while it is still on the roll. Otherwise, cut off a long length (at least 12 inches (30 cm) so that you have plenty to work with."

Keep in mind that you will use up more weaving wire to cover any given length if your warp wires are farther apart. If you wish, you can tape down the ends of your warp wires on one side with masking tape to hold them in place. You could also hold them between your fingers or keep them in place with a ring clamp. [20] X Research source The wires don't have to be exactly parallel. You can create an interesting effect by angling the 2 warp wires slightly apart or curving one or both of them so that the weave is wider in some places than others."

      "content": "Coil the weaving wire once around the bottom warp wire. Starting close to the end of your weaving wire, lay the wire over the front of the bottom warp and wrap it around once, away from yourself. Take care that you only wrap the bottom wire. Hold the wire taut to make sure you get a tight coil. Once your coil is complete, the weaving wire should pass back over the front of the warp wire. Don't start at the very end of the weaving wire. Try to leave a bit of a tail (around 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm)) so that you can secure the weave when you're finished. Depending on what you plan to do with your woven wire, you may wish to start the weave at least .75 inches (1.9 cm) from the ends of the warp wires."

This time, pull the wire towards you instead of away from you. The weaving wire should end up in front of the top warp wire. If your coils are not close enough together, you can nudge them down the warp wires with your fingernails. If you use pliers, you may damage your wire."

From here, you will start the pattern over and continue until your weave reaches the desired length. If you like, you can vary the pattern by doing more coils between each pass. You can even alternate—e.g., doing 2 coils on one side and 4 on the other. As you get more experienced with 2-wire weaving techniques, you can begin experimenting with weaves that incorporate 3 or more warp wires."

Once the wire is woven, you can bend it into the shape of your choice by hand or using pliers. For example, to make a simple ring, take a short section (about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm)) of woven wire and wrap it around a ring mandrel. Use round-nosed pliers to curl the 4 ends of the warp wires into elegant spirals.
