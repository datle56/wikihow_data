      "content": "Fold a square napkin in half diagonally. Lay the napkin flat in front of you then fold it in half so it forms a triangle. If your napkin is only colored or patterned on one side, make sure the pattern faces the outside so your rose will be colorful. [1] X Research source For the best results, use a cloth napkin that is 17 x 17 inches (43 x 43 cm) or 20 x 20 inches (50 x 50 cm) in size, as anything smaller may not fold properly. This method is designed specifically for folding cloth napkins. It may be possible to fold a paper napkin the same way if it’s large enough, but because paper napkins tend to be smaller and thinner, it may break or fold incorrectly."

      "content": "Roll the napkin up from the bottom of the triangle. With the longest side near you, slowly roll the triangle up until it reaches halfway up the napkin. In general, aim to leave a 4-5 inch (10-12 cm) triangle unrolled at the top. This part can be a bit tricky, so it’s okay if you need to redo it a few times until you get the hang of it. [2] X Research source The exact size of the unrolled part of the napkin will vary depending on the size of the napkin."

      "content": "Turn the napkin over and roll up the tail edge. Flip the napkin so that you can’t see the rolls, keeping the longest side nearest to you. At this stage, the napkin should look like a triangle with two tails. Take the end of one tail and roll until it reaches the end of the other tail. When you're done rolling, tuck the free end of your napkin into the small pocket created at the bottom. The napkin will look like a torch or a candle. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Shape the two inside flaps to form the leaves. Inside your creation, there should be two flaps, which will become the leaves of the rose. Pull one to the left and the other to the right. Be gentle, as pulling too hard could cause the rose to fall apart. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn the napkin over and make final adjustments. When you flip the napkin over, the rose and its leaves will be revealed. Adjust the leaf flaps as necessary to make sure the napkin can sit up on its own, and shape the petals to your liking. Repeat this process with any remaining napkins. [5] X Research source"

This way, guests can admire your craftsmanship while being able to easily access their napkin. [6] X Research source Etiquette coach Tami Claytor says the “standard way” to display a napkin is on the left side of the plate. This is another simple option for your rose."

Roses are a symbol of love, so folding rose napkins is a great idea if you’re having a Valentine’s Day party, anniversary dinner, or wedding reception. Choose a napkin color that best matches the event, like red, white, or green for Christmas and orange and brown for Thanksgiving. Rose napkins are a great touch for any occasion. [7] X Research source Even if you’re not hosting a dinner party or special event, feel free to fold rose napkins to add a bit of class and elegance to any meal. Play around with different napkin colors and fabrics. For example, red napkins are great for Valentine’s day or romantic dinners, and velvet napkins can give any dinner a luxurious touch."

Fold each end inward and upward at an angle, crossing over each other to form a bow shape. Slide a napkin ring onto the middle to hold the shape. [8] X Research source"

Then, fold the sides in so they meet in the middle. Fold the bottom of the napkin upward to hide the inner creases and form the body of the envelope. Finally, fold the top piece of the triangle down to “seal” your envelope. [9] X Research source For an extra surprise, slip your dinner menu inside the napkin before closing it! If you don’t want to make an actual envelope, Claytor recommends making a pocket for your silverware. She says, “If you fold [the napkin] in half, take the free side and fold it behind the cloth, [then] tuck them in each other, it'll form an envelope and you can slip the flatware in there.”"

Then, starting at the short end, fold the napkin into 1-inch (2.5 cm) accordion pleats, stopping about 4 inches (10 cm) from the opposite end. Ensure that the last pleat is folded at the bottom edge of the napkin and all other pleats are underneath it. Fold the napkin in half lengthwise so the pleats are on top, then fold the upper left corner down and tuck it behind the center pleat to form a triangle. Let go of the napkin so the pleats fan out."
