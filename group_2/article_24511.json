      "title": "Weed, or marijuana, is a dried form of the cannabis plant.",
      "content": "Weed, or marijuana, is a dried form of the cannabis plant. Typically smoked, this drug can also be brewed into tea or made into an edible form. Many people use marijuana as a recreational drug, but it can also be prescribed medicinally for a variety of medical conditions, including anxiety and pain management. [1] X Research source The legality of marijuana varies from state to state: in some states, you can walk into a dispensary and purchase it from a storefront. In other states, it is not legal to possess marijuana at all, even on your own private property. Keep in mind that “marijuana” can cover both THC and CBD. THC is the property that gets you “high,” or alters your state of mind, while CBD is the property that relaxes you and helps manage pain. These properties can be combined into 1 plant, or they can be separated from each other."

      "content": "The Christian Bible does not specifically mention marijuana by name. As you dive into the Bible to look for arguments for and against cannabis, it’s important to note that weed itself is never mentioned in the Bible. [2] X Research source However, most other drugs are not mentioned, either, but most people still view taking hard drugs as a sin in Christianity."

      "content": "The Bible advocates for obeying all laws, and in some states, weed is illegal. There are many verses in the Bible that state that you should always follow the laws of wherever you are. If marijuana is not legal in your state, then the Bible does not advocate for using it. [3] X Research source Titus 3:1: “Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,” Romans 2:13: “For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.” Romans 3:31: “Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.”"

      "title": "Using a substance to lose self control is a sin.",
      "content": "Using a substance to lose self control is a sin. In the Bible, it clearly states that “drunkards” are to be looked down upon. A drunkard is someone who uses drinks to lose control of their facilities or their behavior. Many Christians assume that if marijuana is used to lose control, then the Bible looks down on it. [4] X Research source 1 Corinthians 5:11: “But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one.” 1 Corinthians 6:10: “Nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”"

      "title": "Using a substance to alter your state of consciousness is a sin.",
      "content": "Using a substance to alter your state of consciousness is a sin. Similar to losing self control, any substances that alter your state of being (or get you high) are not considered a good thing in the Bible. The Bible mostly references strong drink, but many people assume that this means drugs are a bad thing, too. [5] X Research source 1 Peter 4:7: “The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.” Ephesians 5:18: “And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit,” Isaiah 28:7: “These also reel with wine and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed by wine, they stagger with strong drink, they reel in vision, they stumble in giving judgment.”"

      "title": "Smoking weed to get high may be considered a sin.",
      "content": "Smoking weed to get high may be considered a sin. While smoking marijuana or not smoking it is a hugely personal decision, the Bible mentions multiple times that using any substance to alter your state of mind goes against God. This is because your mind should always be steady and able to focus on Him. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Smoking weed for medicinal purposes may not be a sin. There are multiple reasons that people use marijuana, and not all of them are to get high. If you use marijuana for medicinal purposes or you can use it in small amounts without feeling dependent on it, then it may not be considered a sin in Christianity. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Can I use marijuana without losing self control?",
      "content": "Can I use marijuana without losing self control? In many cases, you can use marijuana without altering your state of mind completely. Think about it like having a glass of wine with dinner: in such small amounts, most Christians do not view drinking alcohol as a sin. It’s the same thing with marijuana—if you can use just a little bit that doesn’t alter your state of mind completely, then it might be totally fine."

      "title": "Am I using marijuana for medicinal purposes?",
      "content": "Am I using marijuana for medicinal purposes? Medical marijuana is a fairly divisive topic in the Christian community. Some people believe that marijuana prescribed by a doctor is okay, while others still view it as a sin. [8] X Research source However, if you are using marijuana to treat a medical issue, it’s important to talk to your doctor and do what’s best for your health. In some cases, it may be better for your medical condition to take CBD instead of THC. CBD does not alter your state of mind, so it might be the right choice for you and your faith."

      "content": "Am I becoming dependent on marijuana? The Bible does not advocate for any substance that makes you dependent on it, whether that be drugs or alcohol. If you find that you’re relying on marijuana to get you through the day or you’re using it every single day, it might be time to take a step back and reduce your usage. [9] X Research source While marijuana does not make you physically dependent on it, it can make you emotionally dependent on it. Marijuana can still be considered addictive, even though it does not give you the typical withdrawal symptoms that other drugs do.

      "content": "Is marijuana alienating me from God or other people? Christianity states that the first priority in your life should be God and your faith. If you find that marijuana is keeping you from going to church or talking with God, then it may not be a good fit for you and your lifestyle. [11] X Research source For instance, are you using pot to relax instead of meditating on Bible verses or talking to God? Are you skipping church services to smoke weed instead? If so, your marijuana usage may be getting in the way of your faith."
