      "content": "Friendships differ, and so do texting habits between friends. There’s no “normal” amount to text your friends. A lot of people text their closest friends every day. You might text other friends a few times a month. It’s really up to you. Texting isn’t the only way to stay in touch. You can also connect with friends on social media, instant message, video chats, gaming chats, and email. Don’t stress if you prefer to send a snap or do in-game chats instead of texting. Try group chats. You can text all of your friends at one time, making it easier to keep up with everyone. Plus, you’ll never miss plans or life updates."

      "content": "Do what feels comfortable to you and your friend. Everyone has different texting habits, so talk to your friend about how often you want to text each other. That way, you can keep your friendship going without stressing about how often you’re checking in on each other. [1] X Research source If either of you feels overwhelmed, you’re texting too often. Say something like: “Hey, I want to make sure I’m being a good friend. Do you feel like I text you often enough?” “I really like texting with you, but I’m worried I text too often. Are you comfortable with texting every day?” “Sometimes I feel bad about leaving you on read, but I just get so busy. Does that bother you at all?”"

      "content": "Set boundaries with your friends if they’re texting you too often. Your friend may not even realize that you like to text less often than they do. Talk to them about setting some boundaries for how much you'll text each other. Be honest about how you feel so they know to space out their texts. [2] X Research source Say something like: “I love being your friend, but sometimes I get overwhelmed by my phone notifications. I’d really like it if we cut back on how often we text.” “I totally love talking to you. At the same time, I need to space out our text chats so I have enough time to study. I hope you understand that I’ll respond when I can.” “I really care about our friendship, so I hope you don’t take this the wrong way. During the week, I prefer not to receive texts after 9:00 p.m. because I like to study before bed.”"

      "title": "Respect your friend’s boundaries.",
      "content": "Respect your friend’s boundaries. If your friend expresses a boundary, respect their wishes and text them when it's more convenient for them. Additionally, people tend to get overwhelmed when they get several texts from the same person. It’s best to wait for a response before you message someone again. Unless it’s an emergency, just send one text at a time. For instance, your friend might ask you not to text late a night. If this happens, make sure you stop texting them at the designated time they give you. There are occasional exceptions to this rule. For instance, it’s okay to text your friend again if you need to clarify something in the first text or if something important comes up. Just make sure you aren’t doing this often."
