Twice per day, let your hand rest inside your snake's cage for two or three minutes. Over time, your snake will get used to your scent and learn that it is not something threatening. [2] X Research source Your snake will eventually come out to investigate. Since your snake is just getting used to your presence at this time, you should remain cautious. Remember to wash your hands prior to putting them in the snake's cage. If you forget this step, your snake could easily mistake your hands for prey. [3] X Research source"

After you have lifted it up, you can then hold it with your hands or continue holding it with the hook. [9] X Research source If you feed your snake in the same cage that it lives in, you may want to use a snake hook. The snake hook can be a way of telling the snake that it is holding time rather than eating time. Additionally, you should use tongs to place the snake's food into the cage. The snake may strike at the food, potentially biting your hand on accident. Using tongs will make it less likely that your hand is bitten."
