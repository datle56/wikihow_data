      "content": "Cut the pepper in half lengthwise. Stand the pepper on the cutting board, stem side up. Grip the knife by pinching the blade, right above the handle, with your thumb and the second knuckle of your index finger; your remaining three fingers should grip the handle to give you more control over the blade. Cut the pepper from top to bottom, starting close to the stem and cutting through to the bottom. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the core. Pick up one half of the pepper, cupping it firmly on the outside. Using the tip of your knife, trace and cut away the halved seed cluster from the inside of the pepper piece. Carefully remove and discard it, then repeat with the other pepper half.

      "content": "Cut each half in half again, width-wise. Brace the halved peppers carefully and cut them into quarters. Using the tip of your knife, carefully remove the stem from the top piece and discard it. Scrape out any remaining seeds from the inside of the pepper pieces."

      "title": "Press the quarters of the peppers flat.",
      "content": "Press the quarters of the peppers flat. Lay the pepper pieces on the cutting board, skin-side up. Using the blade of your knife or the palm of your hand, gently press down the pieces and flatten them as much as possible; this will make the pepper much easier to cut. Flip up the pieces and use the tip of your knife to remove the ribs inside."

      "content": "Julienne the pepper pieces. Push the blade downward onto the pepper pieces in a rocking motion while holding them steady with your free hand; be sure to keep your fingers out of the blade's way. As you rock the blade downward, push the handle away from you slightly, which will draw the blade over the cutting surface more efficiently. Continue until all pieces are julienned.

      "title": "Remove the top and bottom of the pepper.",
      "content": "Remove the top and bottom of the pepper. Grip the knife carefully, right above the handle, and brace the pepper lightly with your free hand. Cut off the top of the pepper so that the stem is completely removed. Cut off the bottom as well, leaving the pepper in a cylindrical shape. To salvage the top of the pepper, push the green stalk through the pepper top with your fingers and discard it, keeping the rest. [4] X Research source"

Gently pull open the pepper; remove and discard the core. Be careful when pulling open the pepper- the seeds inside are small and will scatter easily."

With each cut, bring the knife down, touching the tip to the top corner of the rectangle. Lower the rest of the knife down to the cutting board and through the pepper, leaving small, thin strips of pepper. Feed the pepper towards the knife as you cut until all of it is julienned. [6] X Research source Alternatively, put a bell pepper horizontally on your cutting board and slice off the crown. Then turn it around and slice off the bottom. You should then be able to see through the pepper. Use a knife to remove the pith and seeds. Then slice the bell pepper into strips."
