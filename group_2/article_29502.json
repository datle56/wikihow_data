Unsupported filetypes will not show in the browsing window. When you find one you like, select it and press “Open”. Multiple images can be opened at once by pressing Ctrl + click ( ⌘ Cmd + click on Mac) and selecting multiple files in the browsing window. Alternatively, if you want to start a project from scratch, you can go to “File > New”."

You can make a duplicate of the base background layer by right-clicking ( Ctrl + click on Mac) and selecting “Duplicate Layer”. This way you can work on the photo in a duplicate while preserving the base image in its own background layer."
