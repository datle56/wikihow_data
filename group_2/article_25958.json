First, start by reducing the month, day, and year to a single digit each. Next, add those three numbers together. Lastly, reduce the final sum until you get a single number. So reducing the number 12 would be adding 1 and 2 to get 3. [24] X Research source For example, if your birthday is December 30, 1995 the calculation would look like this: Month : 12 = 1 + 2 = 3 Day : 30 = 3 + 0 = 3 Year (first reduction) : 1995 = 1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 24 Year (second reduction) : 24 = 2 + 4 = 6 Life Path Number (first reduction) : 3 + 3 + 6 = 12 Life Path Number (final reduction) : 12 = 1 + 2 = 3 The Life Path Number for someone born on December 30, 1995 would be 3."
