      "title": "Look for legs on the side:",
      "content": "Look for legs on the side: 1. Standard Signal - This is the regular forward-biased diode. 2. Zener - Operated in reverse-biased to hold a constant voltage 3. Small Signal - Used for applications with a much smaller current but with much more accuracy"

      "title": "Look for both legs under:",
      "content": "Look for both legs under: 1. Light Emitting Diode - Emits a colored light based on the materials used internally 2. Photodiode - Captures photons to generate current 3. Infra-Red - Emits light at the infra-red spectrum 4. Varactor - A reverse-biased diode used as a capacitor 5. Schottky - Used for precision and when voltage needs to be conserved"
