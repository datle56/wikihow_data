      "content": "Hike up the luminosity (brightness) in the display settings. Higher luminosity usually means high power consumption (screens need the most energy in a laptop). You may need to depend on a power outlet rather than a battery. Bring an extension cord or a backup battery pack. [1] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 24 February 2021. On a Macbook, increase brightness with F2 and decrease with F1 . Non-Apple laptops typically have brightness controls on the top row of keyboard keys, indicated by an icon of the sun and a plus (+) sign to increase, minus (-) to decrease. Depending on your system, you may need to hold down the Fn key as you press the buttons."

      "content": "Build your own laptop hood. Stores like Target and Ikea sell black square storage boxes/cubes that can be used with certain types of shelves. These boxes also make great DIY laptop hoods—simply slide your laptop inside (with the open side facing you) and use your laptop as normal. You can also try using a regular cardboard box."

      "content": "Work in the shade. Either find a spot under a tree, or set up a large beach umbrella. Not only will this make your laptop screen easier to see, but it'll also keep your laptop from overheating (especially if it's black). If you'd rather keep your body in the sun, keep only the laptop in the shade, and wear a hat with a brim to keep the sun from shining right in your eyes."

      "content": "Wear sunglasses. A pair of polarized sunglasses can do wonders for your vision in the sun. Plus, sunglasses make you look cool. When shopping for sunglasses, choose amber lenses to increase contrast and make details more clear. If given the option, upgrade to glasses that have anti-reflective coating on the front and back of the lens to effectively reduce sun glare."

      "content": "Get under a sheet or towel. If you're in a pinch, try draping a piece of fabric—if you don't have a sheet or towel, an article of clothing will do—over both your head and the laptop. While not the most ideal situation, this will almost certainly improve screen visibility in the sun."

[6] X Research source If you have a choice among laptops, or if you're shopping and want to keep your penchant for the outdoors in mind, look for laptops with screens that have a matte-finish screen. [7] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 24 February 2021. Those with a glossy-finish one might look nicer indoors, but they'll reflect the sun all too well if you take them outside. Matte-screen laptops are few and far between these days, but you may have luck finding a used or refurbished model."

      "content": "Find a glossy-screened laptop that works great in the sun. Now that glossy screens outnumber the matte, your options may appear limited. But not all screens are created equal—even some glossy screens have design enhancements that make them perform well in the sun. When deciding between different glossy-screened laptops, look for keywords in the advertisements/descriptions like “Outdoor View,” “I/O,” “Indoor/Outdoor,” or “Enhanced Outdoor.”"

      "content": "Buy a “rugged” or “outdoors” laptop. Some laptops with outdoor-friendly screens also have other features beneficial for outdoor use, such as a thick chassis that protects your laptop if it drops. These laptops nearly always have the word “rugged” or “outdoor” in their product names. Some of these laptops are even waterproof. Search online for reviews of these models, or drop by your local computer store to ask for recommendations."
