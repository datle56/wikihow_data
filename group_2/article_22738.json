      "title": "Take a few big, long breaths to regain your composure.",
      "content": "Take a few big, long breaths to regain your composure. When you get overwhelmed with emotion, you sometimes forget to breathe. When you feel like you’re about to cry, pay attention to your breathing rather than your emotions. Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Take 3–10 breaths until you feel like you’re less stressed out. [1] X Research source You can also try 4-7-8 breathing. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts, hold your breath for 7 counts, and slowly exhale for 8 counts. Keep your hand on your belly while you’re breathing. As you inhale, keep your chest still and let your belly push your hand out."

      "content": "Distract yourself from your other emotions with this quick trick. Grab the webbing between your thumb and index finger with 2 fingers. Pinch hard enough where you can feel the tension but not so much that it causes you pain. Since you’re distracted by and more focused on the new sensation, your tears are more likely to stop on their own. Alternatively, you can try pinching the bridge of your nose, but this is less discrete."

      "title": "Water cools you down when you feel emotions take over.",
      "content": "Water cools you down when you feel emotions take over. If you’re putting yourself in an emotional situation, keep a glass of ice water nearby. When you feel tears coming on, take a long slow sip of the water. Since your body temperature usually goes up when you’re emotional, it can help you regulate how you’re feeling so you’re more relaxed. [2] X Research source As an added benefit, water also clears up the lump in the back of your throat that you may feel when you’re stressed out or crying."

      "title": "Fiddle with something in your hands to release physical tension.",
      "content": "Fiddle with something in your hands to release physical tension. Keep a squishy stress ball, medallion, or worry stone in your pocket or your hand. When you start feeling frustrated or sad, don’t hold the tension in your body. Instead, squeeze the object tightly in your hand or rub it between your fingers to stay calm. Since you’re refocusing your stress, you’re less likely to start crying. [3] X Research source If you find yourself getting stressed at work, keep an object on your desk so it’s easy to reach. If you don’t have anything with you for stress relief, you might be able to overcome tears just by grasping tightly onto a pen."

      "title": "Clench your fist to regain a feeling of self-control.",
      "content": "Clench your fist to regain a feeling of self-control. When you start feeling sad or full of emotion, it can be hard to control what you’re doing. While you can’t always control when you cry, refocus your attention on parts of your body you can control. Squeeze your hands into tight fists, tense up your legs, or activate your core to stay discrete. Avoid tensing up the muscles in your face since it might make you cry more easily."

    {
      "title": "Think of something positive to redirect your focus.",
      "content": "Think of something positive to redirect your focus. Avoid getting self-conscious about the thing that’s making you cry. Take a second to close your eyes and visualize the things that make you happy. Try reflecting back on the happiest moment of your life, picturing yourself on a dream vacation, or imagining the person you love most wearing something silly. [4] X Research source Even if you do cry, imagining something happy will bring you out of a bad mood."

      "title": "Mentally list the objects in your surroundings to ground yourself.",
      "content": "Mentally list the objects in your surroundings to ground yourself. As soon as you feel your emotions coming on, stop and look around the room. In your head, name 5 things you can see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps you calm down and become more aware of how you’re feeling. [5] X Research source Alternatively, try pointing out all the things that are the same color or start with the same letter in the room."

      "title": "Keep tears from rolling down your cheeks with this simple fix.",
      "content": "Keep tears from rolling down your cheeks with this simple fix. If you already feel tears welling in your eyes, lean back and look straight up. While you’re tilted back, try taking a few deep breaths or visualizing something positive to help you calm down. When you feel like you have better control over your emotions, tilt your head back down. [6] X Research source You may notice a few tears if you don’t lean your head back far enough."

      "title": "Rest your muscles to prevent tears from falling.",
      "content": "Rest your muscles to prevent tears from falling. When you cry, you usually tense up your face and make tears roll down your cheeks. Instead, relax your eyebrows and forehead so they’re not scrunched up. Take a few deep breaths as you loosen your muscles. As you do, you’ll “lock” your tears up so you’re less likely to cry.

      "title": "Lighten the mood with your favorite song or video.",
      "content": "Lighten the mood with your favorite song or video. Rather than staying sad, search through your music and put on something happy or silly that always makes you smile or dance. Browse YouTube for funny video clips so you don’t feel as down. Ease yourself into a more positive and happy mindset so you can regain your composure. [8] X Research source Make a playlist of songs or videos that make you feel better so you have quick access when you need them. Be careful not to deny how you’re feeling if you’re sad or upset. When you’re in a better mood and don’t feel like you’re going to cry anymore, revisit those thoughts and address them."

      "title": "Put some distance between you and the thing making you cry.",
      "content": "Put some distance between you and the thing making you cry. If you can, step away from your desk or out of the room for a couple of minutes. Find a change of scenery, get some water, or go outside so you don’t feel as stressed about the situation. When you feel like the tears have passed, take a couple of deep breaths and come back to handle the situation again. [9] X Research source If you’re at work, politely ask if you can step out before leaving so you stay professional."

      "content": "Alleviate puffy eyes with some cold water. If you have access to a sink, splash some cold water under your eyes to hide that you’re about to cry. If you want to be a little more discrete, just wet your fingers and gently pat underneath your eyes. The cold water helps restrict blood flow so you don’t have puffy eyes or tears. [10] X Research source You could instead use an eye mask or a bag of frozen vegetables if you’re at home."
