Place 2 tablespoons (22 g) of the seeds in a spice or coffee grinder, and grind them until they are a fine powder. You can find fenugreek seeds at many grocery stores, but if your local store doesn’t carry them, visit an Indian grocery, organic grocery store, or a health food store. You can also order the seeds from online spice retailers. If you don’t have a spice, nut, or coffee grinder, you can use a blender or food processor to grind the seeds. You can also find fenugreek seed powder at the grocery store. However, you’ll get better results if you grind the seeds fresh for your mask."

      "title": "Combine the fenugreek seed powder, yogurt, and oil.",
      "content": "Combine the fenugreek seed powder, yogurt, and oil. Add 1 tablespoon (11 g) of fenugreek seed powder, 5 to 6 tablespoons (90 to 108 g) of plain yogurt, and 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 ml to 30 ml) of olive or argan oil. Mix the ingredients well with a spoon to ensure that they’re fully combined. You can grind your own fenugreek seeds, but store-bought powder works just as well. For the mask, full fat yogurt usually works best. It delivers protein to the hair to help strengthen it and heal damage. Add more of the yogurt and oil if you have long and/or thick hair."
