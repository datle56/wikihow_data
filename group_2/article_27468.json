On a landline, dial 011, which is the International Direct Dialing (IDD) number for the U.S and Canada, also known as an exit code. This signals that the phone number you will dial next is outside of the United States.

This number will vary depending on what the country of origin is for the number you wish to dial, but it will always have 1-3 digits. For example, if you were calling a phone number in Australia, the country code is 61. So, if you're using a mobile phone, you'd dial + 61 . On a landline, you'd dial 011 61 . You do not need to enter a country code if you're calling any of the following countries from the United States, as they all share the same country code of 1: American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guam, Jamaica, Montserrat, Northern Territory, Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, or the US Virgin Islands.

      "content": "Dial the city/area code, if applicable. After the international dialing code and country code, you will dial the city code or area code, typically given to you as part of the local number. This narrows down the phone number to a specific city or region within the country you’re calling to. The city/area code can be a number between 1-3 digits long. Note that smaller countries may not use city or area codes at all, in which case you will dial whatever phone number is given. Note that if a city/area code is not included in the number you have, ask the phone number's owner for the code instead of looking it up based on location."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source Phone numbers from other countries may have more or fewer digits than the standard 7 numbers in a domestic U.S. phone number. If a “0” is given before the phone number you are meant to call, omit this, and dial the following phone number. The zero is a “trunk code” meant for domestic calls within many countries but is not used for placing international calls. For a complete example, say you are calling the British Museum in the United Kingdom. To call from the U.S. landline, you use the IDD number “011.” The country code for the UK is 44, and the area code for London is 20. The rest of the phone number is “7323 8000.” So, in total, you would dial 011 44 20 7323 8000 to place your call."

      "content": "Ask your phone carrier about international call rates. Talk to the service provider for the phone you will use to make an international call before you dial. Ask both the provider for your landline and for your cell phone (if applicable) as the rates may differ. If you plan to make calls abroad often, talk to the provider about their international calling plans. Otherwise, inquire about the one-time rates you would be charged to place a single call to another country. Note that there are often added fees or overage charges that may make the package cost-effective only if you plan to make a certain number of calls per month. Some phone service providers may give you other specific instructions for dialing an international number. You should also remember that when dialing from any internal business line, you may need to dial “9” to reach any external line."
