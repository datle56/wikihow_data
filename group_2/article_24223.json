      "content": "Buy a mountable backup camera for your specific vehicle. For safety, make sure you purchase a device specifically designed to be a rear-view camera. Purchasing one made for your specific vehicle will make it easier to install than a standard aftermarket camera. So you can install it easily, look for a camera that mounts onto or directly behind your license plate.

      "content": "Get an external monitor if you want to keep your existing rear-view mirror. An external backup monitor is a small video screen that mounts onto your windshield similarly to a GPS. Though they take up more space than internal monitors, external monitors are far easier to see and can be easily replaced if necessary. If you’d like, you can use a standard video monitor instead. However, keep in mind that it may not have all the same features as devices designed for use with backup cameras."

      "content": "Purchase an internal monitor for a less obtrusive device. An internal backup monitor is a fully functioning rear-view mirror that houses a small screen inside the glass. Some internal monitors clip on top of your current rear-view mirror, but others replace your original mirror entirely. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Most internal monitors shut off and disappear when not in use, making them a perfect option if you want to preserve your car’s looks."

      "title": "Buy power and video cords if your camera and monitor didn’t include them.",
      "content": "Buy power and video cords if your camera and monitor didn’t include them. For most rear-view camera installations, you’ll need camera and monitor splitter cords with connectors for video and power cables, 2 bare wire power cables, and an RCA video cable . [3] X Research source Most installation kits include these cables, but some may require you to purchase them separately. Some camera models use wireless transmitters instead of standard video cables."

      "title": "Drill a small hole in the license plate mounting area.",
      "content": "Drill a small hole in the license plate mounting area. Make sure there are no obstructions between the license plate mount and the rear wiring chamber. Then, create a small hole in the car using a power drill equipped with a high-speed twist drill bit . Line up your hole so it is directly behind where your camera’s power and video cable will go. [6] X Research source To figure out where to make the hole, hold your camera up to the area you intend to mount it. Then, note the spot where its splitting cord sits. Create a hole that’s large enough to fit your camera’s power and video cable. If you come across any obstructions, try to remove them. If you can’t, see if you can make a hole nearby. For most jobs, you’ll need a drill bit that has a diameter between 1 ⁄ 8 and 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32 and 0.64 cm)."

These small rubber washers, available at most home improvement stores, will keep the wire in place and prevent leaks.

They hook directly into your vehicle’s tail lights and are normally located in the hatch or trunk of your car. These cords look different for every vehicle so, if you can’t find them, consult your owner’s manual for model specific information."
