      "content": "Condition the pipe by heating the smoking area and the adjacent area of the can. While there's no scientific evidence to back this claim, the general idea is that this will vaporize chemicals used to coat the interior of the can before you light up. You can also sand the paint off the indention and the adjacent area. The belief is that this removes a large part of the potentially harmful material that might be vaporized as you smoke. You can use the end of the hole-poker you used, or some sandpaper if some is available."

      "content": "Understand the health risks. Heating and inhaling aluminum is commonly believed to have a link to Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases. While it's true that it's difficult to heat the aluminum to a high enough vaporization point using a simple Bic lighter , it's also inefficient and probably best to not mess with. Studies are inconclusive on whether aluminum can cause Alzheimer's. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source That said, the plastics used in the paint and inner lining can contain BPA, and it isn't clear that heating and sanding will remove enough of these plastics. When smoked, it's possible that they may increase your risk of cancer. The basic principle of the soda-can pipe can also be transferred to widely available things like apples, potatoes, and other things that don't have the harmful potential for side-effects. Smoke at your own risk."
