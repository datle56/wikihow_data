The ideal temperature for milkshake-ready ice cream is 20째F (-7째C) and your freezer will probably keep it at about 0째F (-18째C). Allow the ice cream to sit out on the counter for a few minutes to soften. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Add three scoops of ice cream to your blender or milkshake mixer. A milkshake mixer is best because it churns and aerates your milkshake at the same time. But if you're not ready to invest in professional equipment, a regular kitchen blender or immersion (stick) blender will work fine. [3] X Research source If you don't have any of those things, use a large bowl and a whisk to beat the ice cream and milk together. [4] X Research source As you begin the recipe, take the glass you plan to use for your milkshake and put it in the freezer. Then it will be nice and chilled when you're ready to serve. [5] X Research source In the next section, we'll tell you what to look for when choosing milkshake ingredients ."

[6] X Research source This is when you can transform your vanilla milkshake into a malt, chocolate shake, strawberry shake, or even a caramel-pretzel-chocolate-chip shake. Never add ice to a milkshake. It will water down your shake and dilute the flavor and creaminess. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Blend your milkshake for about 1 minute.",
      "content": "Blend your milkshake for about 1 minute. If you are using a blender, don't just turn it on and let it go. Alternate between pulsing the blender and then hand-mixing with a spoon. This will give you the same effect as a spindle milkshake mixer. No matter which mixing method you use (whisk, stick blender, professional milkshake blender), you want to make sure your shake remains thick. If you insert a spoon and try to pull it out, the thick shake should give a little resistance. If you like a lumpy milkshake, only mix your shake for 30-45 seconds. If your shake seems too thick, add a splash of milk. [8] X Research source If your shake seems too watered down, add another scoop or half-scoop of ice cream and mix. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the milkshake into your chilled glass.",
      "content": "Pour the milkshake into your chilled glass. If the milkshake is the right thickness and consistency, you should need to use the spoon to get it out of the blender and into the glass. If it slides out easily, it's too thin or over-mixed and you'll want to add more ice cream. Top your milkshake with a healthy squirt of whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. Or garnish with a little extra of your chosen ingredients (like a fresh strawberry for your strawberry shake). Serve with a spoon and a straw."

      "title": "Choose a high-quality vanilla ice cream.",
      "content": "Choose a high-quality vanilla ice cream. For almost every type of milkshake, you will begin with a base of vanilla ice cream, even chocolate and strawberry shakes! [10] X Research source The vanilla ice cream is just sweet enough that the addition of flavored syrups or ingredients like cookies or candy won't make the milkshake overly sweet. Look for a high-density ice cream. Choose two brands of ice cream that are the same size (a pint, a quart, etc.) and hold one in each hand. The one that feels heavier will make the better milkshake. Ice creams that are lighter and fluffier contain more air. When you mix the milkshake you'll be introducing even more air, and won't get the thick, creamy consistency you want in a milkshake. Go for the dense ice cream over the extra-churned ice cream so you'll start out with less air. You can of course use any ice cream flavor you want, so stray from the vanilla base if you want to experiment. If you want a mint chocolate chip milkshake but don't want to mess with mint extract and chocolate chips, go ahead and use a mint chip ice cream."

      "title": "Choose a high-quality milk.",
      "content": "Choose a high-quality milk. Whole milk is preferable for a milkshake, since it has a fuller flavor and will make a thicker shake. But if you prefer skim, soy, or nut milk, feel free to use those instead. Just remember these milks tend to be a little thinner, so you want to either use less milk or add a little more ice cream for consistency. [11] X Research source If you can, look for a high-quality, locally produced milk. The better quality ingredients you put into your milkshake, the better the milkshake. If you're lactose intolerant or prefer to eat plant-based products, there are a wide variety of nut milks on the market to choose from, including soy, oat, almond, coconut, cashew, rice, hemp, and more. Each has a somewhat different flavor and consistency."
