      "title": "Remove the boot laces.",
      "content": "Remove the boot laces. Before you begin treating or waterproofing the leather, be sure to take out the laces. They’ll only get in the way if you leave them in the boots. Plus, leaving the laces in will make it difficult to treat and waterproof the boots’ leather tongue. [1] X Research source Set the laces aside in a safe place. Once the boots have been treated and have dried, you can put the laces back in."

      "title": "Knock any loose dirt off of the boot leather.",
      "content": "Knock any loose dirt off of the boot leather. To ready the boots for cleaning and waterproofing, remove any loose soil or mud that has built up on the boots. Knock the boots firmly against each other to dislodge soil and mud. [2] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. It’s best to do this outside, so that you don’t leave a pile of dirt and small stones inside your home."

      "title": "Clean the boot leather with a cleaning gel.",
      "content": "Clean the boot leather with a cleaning gel. Cleaning gel typically comes in an aerosol can and can be sprayed directly onto the leather surface. Follow the directions printed on the gel container, and let the gel sit for at least 1 hour after applying it to the boot leather. Then use a clean rag to rub the cleaning gel (and the dirt it’s collected) off of the leather. [3] X Research source If you prefer not to use a cleaning gel, you can also clean leather with a 1:1 mixture of white vinegar and water. An all-purpose saddle soap (bought at a feed and tack store) will also clean leather boots. [4] X Research source Depending on how dirty the boots were, you may need to use 2 or 3 rags to clean them."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the boots and let them dry.",
      "content": "Rinse the boots and let them dry. Run the cleaned boots under a light stream of water from a garden hose or (if you’re working indoors) bathroom sink or tub. You don’t need to soak the boots, so turn off the water once you’ve rinsed all of the leather surfaces. [5] X Research source Let the boots sit for at least 24 hours to dry. If the weather is dry and sunny, place the boots outdoors to dry. To speed up the drying, stuff one or two sheets of newspaper into each boot. Newspaper helps absorb the moisture, drying your boots faster. Do not use a blow dryer to dry the boots, as it can cause the leather to crack."

    {
      "title": "Rub conditioning oil into the boot leather.",
      "content": "Rub conditioning oil into the boot leather. Conditioning oil should only be applied once the boots have fully dried. The consistency of this oil is like thick cream, so use your fingers to dip out a quarter-sized scoop of conditioning oil. Hold the boot from the inside using your other hand, and then rub the conditioning oil into the leather. [6] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. If you have logging or industrial leather boots, mink oil may also work, but be wary about using it on standard hiking boots. Mink oil may over-soften the dry-tanned leather used for many hiking boots. Conditioning boots will help keep the leather soft and supple. Leather that does not receive adequate conditioning may dry and become brittle over time."

      "title": "Avoid applying products with lanolin to your leather boots.",
      "content": "Avoid applying products with lanolin to your leather boots. Some types of leather product, like jackets or purses, benefit from the application of products containing lanolin, as lanolin naturally softens and moisturizes the leather. [7] X Research source If applied to boots, though, the lanolin could soften the leather too much. This can lead to the boots becoming damaged while you’re using them outdoors. Check the list of included ingredients and chemicals on the side of a product if you’re unsure whether or not it includes lanolin."

      "title": "Apply a waterproof wax to the boot leather.",
      "content": "Apply a waterproof wax to the boot leather. Most types of waterproof wax come in a plastic container or tin. Dip a clean rag into the waterproof wax and massage the wax into all of the exterior leather surfaces of the boot. Work the rag in a circular motion, and fully rub the wax into one section of the leather before moving on to the next. [8] X Research source Apply waterproof wax to the boots once a year. Waterproof wax will seal the boot leather for many months."

      "title": "Consider a waterproof spray instead if you’re in a hurry.",
      "content": "Consider a waterproof spray instead if you’re in a hurry. Waterproof spray comes in an aerosol can and can be sprayed directly onto the boot leather. It can be applied more quickly than wax, so opt for a spray if you don’t have much time to spend waterproofing your boots. [9] X Research source Waterproof sprays may not need to be rubbed into the leather at all. Consult the directions on the packaging. The disadvantage of waterproof sprays is that they do not soak into the leather as well as a wax. Consequently, a spray will need to be applied several times during the course of a single winter."

    {
      "title": "Let the boots dry before wearing them.",
      "content": "Let the boots dry before wearing them. Whether you apply a waterproofing wax or a spray, you’ll need to give the leather time to absorb the chemicals and dry before wearing the boots. Air dry the boots until all of the wax has been absorbed and the leather is completely dry to the touch. [10] X Research source Place the boots in the path of a fan to speed up the drying process. The tongue should be propped open, and the fan should blow room temperature air on the boots. Never use a blow-dryer to dry the boots. The sudden application of heat can crack the leather."
