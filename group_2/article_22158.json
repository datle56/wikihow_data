[3] X Trustworthy Source Understood Nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences, such as ADHD or dyslexia Go to source Figure out your wake up time based on what time you need to get to school or work and how long your routine may take.

Build in a cushion in case you run late. Avoid using an alarm that plays loud and banging music or that has annoying high-pitched noises. Open your eyes and let them get used to the light. Sit up and then slowly get out of bed. Try some light stretching or yoga to get your blood flowing.
