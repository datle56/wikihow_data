      "title": "Begin with a confinement period.",
      "content": "Begin with a confinement period. Never allow two cats to interact face to face right away. Cats are territorial by nature. Your current cat will not react well if you simply introduce a new cat into its territory. Begin the introduction process with a period of confinement. [1] X Research source Jessica Char. Cat &amp; Dog Behaviorist. [2] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Choose a small room to keep the new cat. Make sure the cat has all the essential, such as food, a litter box, a scratching post, and so on. At first, keep the new cat's food, water, and other things away from the door. Interacting through the door can help the cats get used to each other, but you should not encourage too much interaction right away."

      "content": "Trade items between the cats. Cats learn to recognize other animals through scents and pheromones. In order to ease both cats into knowing a new animal, swap toys and bedding. The transition will go smoother if each cat is used to the other cat's scent. [3] X Research source Jessica Char. Cat &amp; Dog Behaviorist. [4] X Trustworthy Source Best Friends Animal Society Nonprofit animal welfare organization dedicated to saving animal lives by operating and supporting no-kill animal shelters Go to source For best results, go for items you've seen each cat rubbing up against or nuzzling."

      "title": "Encourage the cats to interact through the door.",
      "content": "Encourage the cats to interact through the door. After a few days, you can begin allowing the cats to interact through the doors. Play with each cat near the door. Move bedding, toys, food, and water closer to the door. The cats may be standoffish and nervous at first, but be persistent. You want the cat to gradually get used to the other animal. You may see your cats pawing at one another through the door. As long as there is no hissing, this can be seen as a form of play."

      "title": "Switch out the cats.",
      "content": "Switch out the cats. After two to three days of interaction through the doors, switch the cats between confinement areas. Let the new cat explore the house while the old cats are placed in the confinement area. This will get your new cat used to its new home and allow the other cats to get used to the new cat's scent. [5] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Switch out the cats several times a day for a few days. Make sure you only let the new cat roam around the house when you are home to supervise."

    {
      "title": "Allow the cats to look at one another.",
      "content": "Allow the cats to look at one another. If it's possible, let the cats look at each other before interacting. You can place a screen door between the confinement area and the rest of your home. You can also let the cats take a peak at one another with the door cracked open slightly. While this can certainly help with a smooth interaction, it may not always be possible depending on your home's set up. If you can't do this step, simply proceed to the next step."

    {
      "title": "Have the cats meet.",
      "content": "Have the cats meet. Only take this step if all the cats seem calm. All your cats should be eating, drinking, and using the litter box as normal. If your cats aren't showing signs of distress, you can let everyone meet face to face. [6] X Research source Jessica Char. Cat &amp; Dog Behaviorist. How long this will take depends on the temperament of your cats. [7] X Research source You can never quite predict how an interaction will go. Best case scenario, all the cats will act normal after inspecting the new household member. There may be some hissing and scratching. However, there is usually no need to intervene. Animals can often work out such conflicts amongst themselves."

[8] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Flattened ears, growling, spitting, and crouching are all signs a cat is becoming very aggressive. [9] X Research source Jessica Char. Cat &amp; Dog Behaviorist. If you notice any of your cats behaving in this way, find a way to distract them. Clap your hands or throw something like a pillow near the cat to distract it. Herd your cats to separate parts of the house if the aggression does not taper off after distracting your cat."

      "content": "Separate the cats when they're alone at first. Even if the introduction goes smoothly, keep the cats separate for the first few weeks when you're not home. A new cat will disrupt the balance of your household. Territorial disputes, or fights over food and toys, could break out when you're not home to intervene. Make sure all your cats have a chance to calm down with the new household member before leaving them alone together. [10] X Research source"

An aggressive cat, or one with existing behavioral issues, may not do well with other cats. [13] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source When selecting an adult cat, make sure it's lived with other cats before. A cat that's used to being an only child may never adjust to living with other animals. Ask at the pet store or shelter if a cat you're considering has any aggressive tendencies or behavioral issues. Kittens can usually adapt to situations quicker, especially if they're still very young at the time of the adoption."
