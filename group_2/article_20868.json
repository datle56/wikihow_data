      "title": "Dose the dog correctly.",
      "content": "Dose the dog correctly. Generally, you give a milligram per pound of dog. You can give it every 8 hours or so. So if your dog weighs 14 pounds, you can give 14 milligrams of Benadryl every 8 hours. However, it's always best to check with the vet for an appropriate dose.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Using children's Benadryl can make dosing easier, as it comes in smaller doses. In severe allergic reactions, a slightly higher dose may be appropriate, such as 2 milligrams per pound. Pills are usually easiest because most dogs don't like the flavor of the liquid. However, you can use liquid Benadryl (the children's formula). Usually, every 5 milliliters of liquid has 12.5 milligrams of Benadryl."

      "title": "Give it with food, if possible.",
      "content": "Give it with food, if possible. You can give Benadryl without food. However, using food will lessen the chances of drooling and vomiting. Plus, it will make it easier to get your dog to take it. [2] X Research source For instance, you can place the pill on a small piece of bread smeared with peanut butter, which your dog will likely gobble down."

      "title": "Apply it topically as needed.",
      "content": "Apply it topically as needed. Another option is to apply the Benadryl to the skin. You can use a spray, cream, or stick. However, be sure not to apply more than a couple of times a day, and don't combine it with oral Benadryl, as that can lead to overdose. It's not as effective as an oral medication, but it can help some. The Benadryl will have little benefit if your dog licks it off. Cover the area with a bandage or put a t-shirt or cone collar on your dog to prevent it from licking the irritated area."

      "title": "Watch for a reaction.",
      "content": "Watch for a reaction. While Benadryl is generally safe, any medication can cause a reaction if your dog happens to be allergic to it. Watch for stomach issues such as diarrhea and vomiting. Also notice if your dog is less interested in eating or is having trouble breathing. Agitation or a fast-beating heart is also an issue. Call your vet if you notice any of these side effects. [3] X Research source Also, some sleepiness is to be expected with Benadryl. However, if your dog seems excessively lethargic, is having trouble waking up, or is non-responsive, you should call your vet."

      "content": "Discuss it with your vet. While Benadryl is generally safe for dogs, every dog is different. It's best to talk to your vet before giving your dog Benadryl, to make sure it will be safe and to get a dose recommendation. [4] X Research source Technically, Benadryl hasn't been approved by the FDA for cats and dogs, but most vets agree it's safe. Discussing dosage with your vet is important because dogs can overdose on Benadryl. [5] X Research source"

Dogs with allergies tend to scratch more, and if your dog has been diagnosed with allergies, Benadryl can help alleviate the symptoms.

      "content": "Ensure your product only contains diphenhydramine. In the United States, most products with the Benadryl label only contain diphenhydramine. However, this ingredient has fallen out of use in other countries. For instance, in the UK, cetrizine is the active ingredient instead. While this ingredient is also dog-safe, it won't have all the same effects. [9] X Research source"
