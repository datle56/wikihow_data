      "content": "Consider what you want your Pokémon sprite to look like. You may want to have your Pokémon have the features of a single class of Pokémon, such as an electric Pokémon that combines the features of Pikachu and Voltorb. You may instead want to have a Pokémon that crosses types, such as a miniature version of Gamera that combines Charizard's flame with Blastoise's jet appendages. Even if you want to create a sprite to fit into a single Pokémon class, you may want to borrow from Pokémon of several classes to create your sprite. If you want to create an electric Pokémon with a body like Voltorb's, you may want to give it a shock aura that looks similar to Gasly's gaseous aura or projections resembling Bulbasaur's whip-like tendrils."

Instead of using a Poké Ball, you'll use the screen capture commands for your computer system or the graphic editor program you'll be using. You'll need a Pokémon for the principal body type, and one or more additional Pokémon for arms, legs, and other appendages."

      "content": "Copy the Pokémon images to your graphic editor program. Place the captured images close together to make it easier to move image portions from one Pokémon to another. You may also wish to save your selection of images, so that if you make a mistake, you don't have to recapture the images when starting over. Some images will display a black background when copied onto the canvas of your graphic editor program. For those images, you'll need to erase or repaint the background to match the canvas, or use the option to make the background transparent when pasted if such an option is available."

      "content": "Cut the part from the donor Pokémon that you want to apply to the base Pokémon. If you plan to use the part more than once on the base Pokémon, you may instead want to copy the part. You may want to flip or rotate the part to make it better fit onto the base Pokémon before attaching it, such as if you want to use Feraligatr's head spikes as chin or belly spikes for a sprite made from Voltorb's body. In some cases, you may want to erase away the body of the donor Pokémon, leaving only the part you want to attach to your sprite. For example, Voltorb and Gastly are both ball-shaped, so if you want to put Gasly's aura on Voltorb, you can erase Gasly's body, leaving only its aura."
