      "content": "Address your personal hygiene so you feel good about yourself. You don’t have to be movie-star handsome or body-builder fit to be an attractive person. Take care of yourself so that you look and smell good every day. Not only will you look more attractive, but you'll feel more confident, too. [1] X Expert Source JT Tran Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Brush your teeth at least twice a day and use mouthwash or chew gum if you have bad breath. Take a shower every day or every other day, especially if you’ve gotten sweaty or have been somewhere with strong odors, like a restaurant or a bonfire. Wear clean clothes that have been washed recently. Keep your nails clean and trimmed. Use deodorant every day to help combat body odor."

      "content": "Smile and practice good posture so you look and feel more confident. When you walk, keep your shoulders pressed back and avoid slouching forward. Look straight ahead and make eye contact with the people you pass instead of staring at the ground. Give others a genuine smile. Having open body language and facial expressions automatically make you a more approachable and interesting person. Girls who seem out of your league aren’t going to want someone who doesn’t believe in himself or who seems super insecure."

      "content": "Develop your hobbies and interests so you’re a well-rounded person. It may seem contrary to focus on yourself when all you really want is to focus on her, but becoming a better person is the best way to become more attractive to girls who are out of your league. Don’t worry about choosing a hobby that is “cool;” instead, focus on something you’re truly passionate about. Being yourself is more attractive than pretending to be someone you’re not. Sports, comedy, history, politics, animals, video games, art, travel, cooking, and woodworking are all cool things, but don’t be afraid to think outside the box!"

      "content": "Work to overcome your insecurities so you can be a healthier individual. Everyone has insecurities, but letting those self-perceived traits keep you from pursuing relationships or living your best life can be really harmful. Think about the ways in which you feel insecure: do you think you’re ugly, stupid, boring, or annoying? Perhaps you’ve been turned down before or have been bullied and this has affected your beliefs about yourself. Try the following to work on overcoming insecurities: [2] X Research source Identify which characteristics you feel insecure about. Think back to when you first started to feel that way. Visualize the kind of person you would like to be. Give yourself small goals to work past your insecurities, like reaching out to a new friend to initiate getting together, joining a new group or club, or simply making more eye contact with people. To pump up your own confidence, try playing upbeat music that makes you feel good right before you're going to see the girl you like.

Then, when you notice you’re saying something negative, stop, think, and reframe the thought to be something positive. [4] X Research source Implementing positive self-talk can be really hard because you have to break the habit of thinking badly about yourself. Be patient and keep at it. The kinder you are to yourself, the better you will feel. If you find yourself thinking things like, “She probably thinks she's better than me,\" reframe that to, \"I'm so glad to get to go on a date with a really awesome girl.\" [5] X Expert Source JT Tran Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 May 2020."

You want to be noticeable when you’re trying to attract someone out of your league, but you don’t want to be noticed because you’re mean or rude. Instead, choose to be noticed because of your good character. A more long-lasting relationship will be built on that kind of attraction.

Regardless of whether she's a model or the girl next door, she is ultimately a regular person with flaws and quirks, just like everyone else! Remind yourself that no matter how out of reach or unattainable she seems, she is a person who is most likely looking for a genuine connection with someone else, just like you. When someone seems out of your league, it’s helpful to remind yourself that they go through the same things as everyone else: they might have bad hair days or break out with acne; maybe they have anxiety or struggle in school. No one is perfect, no matter what it looks like from the outside!"

Just working up the confidence to go up to a girl and start talking to her can be the hardest part, especially if it seems like she is always with her friends. Try to be as casual as possible and have a question or opening line prepared. [7] X Research source You could say something like, “Hi, I’m Jack. I noticed that you were working on the set for the new school play. How is that coming along?” If you’re out at a bar or party, you could try something like, “Hey, I’m Taylor. I noticed you’re friends with Alisha. How do you guys know each other?”"

As you get to know her, ask her open-ended questions about what she does, what she’s into, where she’s from, and other similar things. Don’t be afraid to share things about yourself, too, especially if you find you have something in common. [8] X Research source If this is a girl that lots of other people are interested in, she may be used to people talking to her just because of her looks. Try saying something like, “Tell me more about what you’re studying in school,” or “What do you like to do for fun?\""

For example, if she loves salsa dancing, you could take dance classes. Or, if she is really into pop culture, download a few podcasts to brush up on the latest news. [9] X Research source You could even ask her to teach you something or to share her knowledge with you. This would be a really flattering way to get to know her better. Try saying something like, “I would love to hear more about what got you interested in art. Is that something you grew up around?” Don't be afraid to talk about the things you like, either. By showcasing yourself for a moment, you'll get her a chance to know who you really are. Then, you can shift the attention back to her.

[11] X Research source If she tells you three different times that she is a vegetarian and you keep forgetting, she is definitely not going to feel like you really want to get to know her. If she tells you she and a friend are taking a trip, ask her about it the next time you see her. She’ll appreciate that you made the effort to remember."

Whether you tell a funny personal story or simply use your wit to make funny comments, pay attention to what she responds to the most. Avoid telling cheesy joke-book jokes. Instead, be willing to laugh at yourself or tell stories from your own life. For example, try sharing something embarrassing that happened to you but that ended up being funny, like a mishap at a store or a misunderstanding at school. Don’t be afraid to use social media to your advantage. If you can find out what kinds of memes or videos she likes, you can tailor your jokes to fit that kind of content. For example, if she loves dog videos, you could pull up a favorite funny dog video to share with her."

Group activities are a great place to start getting more familiar with this person; plus, it’ll give both of you a chance to see how the other interacts with friends. Try inviting her to a movie, concert, sports game, art exhibit, or fun dinner. Say something like, “Hey Amy, me and a few friends are getting tickets to the big game on Friday. Do you want to come along? We’ll probably go out after to get something to eat, too.” You could also say something like, “My friends and I were planning to go and see that new movie that’s coming out.

Texting is a great way to bond and get to know each other better, and it can also let you show more of your personality and humor if you tend to be shyer in person. When asking for her number, say something like, “I’d love to send you that video we were talking about.

Make sure to keep things light-hearted and fun. Pay attention to how she responds to your flirting. If she blushes or responds to you similarly, she is most likely into it.

Try standing close to her so that your shoulders touch, lightly touch her arm when you make a joke, or pass her something so that your hands touch. Keep your touching to “safe areas,” though, like her shoulders, arms, upper back, and hands. If she steps back when you get close to her or seems uncomfortable in any way, give her some space. If she seems emotionally and physically comfortable after you've broken the touch barrier, you can continue to escalate your flirting.
