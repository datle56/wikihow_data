      "content": "Position the wig grip 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) back from your natural hairline. Tuck the grip behind your ears, as well. A wig grip resembles a headband and is typically made of double-sided velvet to grip your hair or skin on one side and the wig on the other. [4] X Research source There are also wig grips made from gel which have a pebbled texture on one side to prevent slippage. If you have a gel wig grip, position it so the textured side faces your head."

Place the hook-and-loop fastener clasp behind your head, at the nape of your neck. You want the wig band to feel secure, but not tight. [6] X Research source Wig bands are often helpful for people who get headaches after wearing a wig all day. The band redistributes the weight of the wig and is good for relieving pressure. If you have a small head, you might have a long piece of extra fabric at the back of your neck once you’ve fastened the hook-and-loop fastener. Tuck it in underneath the rest of the wig grip so it doesn’t get in the way when you put on the wig. [7] X Research source"

It can rip out your hairs when removed, which is painful. You can also try using just two pieces of tape, one on either side of the part, for a fairly secure but easier-to-remove option."

If you have longer hair, make sure the flyaways are tucked away into the cap or secured with gel or hairspray. You want to avoid errant hairs falling into the glue and getting stuck."

Silicone never stretches out and will last the entire lifespan of your wig, making it an economical choice. Silicone is not a particularly breathable material, so if it’s a hot day your head may get sweaty."
