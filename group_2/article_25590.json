      "content": "“L rizz” is a total lack of romantic charisma. If someone has “L rizz,” it means that they’re not super great at attracting other people, or at flirting. In fact, they may even repel others. It’s a spin on the popular slang term “rizz” which is essentially the ability to “make it happen,” romantically speaking. It’s paired with the slang term “L,” which is short for “loss.” [1] X Research source Here, “L” is used as a sort of negative modifier of rizz, to express a total lack of it. Examples: “We have to work on your game, dude. You have L rizz.” “He desperately needs a wingman with all that L rizz he’s got.” “Maybe you can’t get a guy because of your L rizz.”"
