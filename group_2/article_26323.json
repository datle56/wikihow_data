      "content": "Practice good hygiene. While some things will vary depending on your body type and personal style, you'll need to stick to some basics to avoid scaring most men away. Wear deodorant. Some men are lucky enough to have fewer sweat glands and may not need to use deodorant on a daily basis. However, most do. Reapply deodorant as needed, especially in warm weather or after exercise. Shower at least once a day. Use soap and water to rinse away dirt, dead skin, and bacterial buildup. Some people with fine or oily hair may need to shampoo daily, but most only need to wash their hair a few times a week or even less. Just don't go more than 14 days without a shampoo. [8] X Research source Keep your nails clean and free from dirt. Your nails can be any length, shape, or color you prefer. If your nails are longer, buff out breaks with a nail file to keep them from snagging on hair and clothing."

      "content": "Dress for the occasion. Wearing clothing inappropriate for a situation may make you appear unprepared or foolish. You may not be the type of guy who wears a suit every day; just make sure you own one for when you're expected to wear it. For more formal occasions like a job interview or wedding, stick to a dark matching suit. Your dress shirt and tie can be colorful as long as they don't clash or look tacky. Business casual is a happy medium for when you want to look sharp without overdoing it. Wear a collared shirt, slacks, and dress shoes. Pair with a blazer for a smarter look or a sweater. Ties are optional. This is a good look for networking events, evening parties, and first dates. [12] X Research source Casual wear covers just about everything else, such as the classic T-shirt and jeans look. This can be your day-to-day style. Cities with warmer climates may be more lax with dress codes. Nobody wants to wear a dark suit and jacket in extreme weather. If you aren't sure what to wear to an event, ask other men who will be there what they plan on wearing. If you're going to a restaurant or venue, try figuring out what's expected by looking up photos of the establishment online."
