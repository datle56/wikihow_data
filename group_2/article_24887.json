      "content": "Purchase a pouch, tin, or box to transport your tobacco on-the-go. Search online or specialty shop for a leather pouch, tin, or airtight plastic box that can hold a small amount of tobacco. If you aren’t sure about which item to purchase, ask a store associate or consult online reviews for further recommendations.

      "content": "Keep a handful of tobacco in a pouch and transfer the rest to a container. Purchase a mason jar or other sturdy container that can store a large amount of tobacco at once. Pour your tobacco into a Ziploc bag and close the top to create an airtight seal. Place this baggy in the mason jar, then place the lip on top. If you live in a humid area, mason jars might leave your tobacco feeling too moist. In this case, consider investing in a metal, humidity-controlled container, which can be purchased online."

      "title": "Use a Hydrostone to moisten your tobacco in a pouch.",
      "content": "Use a Hydrostone to moisten your tobacco in a pouch. Soak your Hydrostone in a glass of water for 5 minutes, then blot it dry so the stone is no longer dripping wet. After this, slide the Hydrostone into the pouch to keep your tobacco moist. Check on your pouch on a daily or regular basis to make sure your tobacco stays moist, and remove it if the tobacco begins to get wet. [2] X Research source You can find Hydrostones online, or in most stores that sell outdoor goods or tobacco supplies. For more specific guidance, consult the manufacturer’s guide."

      "title": "Place a section of foil on top of the tobacco.",
      "content": "Place a section of foil on top of the tobacco. Cut a small sheet of aluminum foil to serve as a buffer for your product. Place the pouch on top of the sheet, then trace around the bottom of your container. Cut out the tracing, then arrange the small section of foil on top of your ground tobacco. Try to trace your pouch as exactly as possible so the tobacco is fully covered."

    {
      "title": "Set a damp, folded paper towel on top of the foil.",
      "content": "Set a damp, folded paper towel on top of the foil. Rip away a section of paper towel, then soak with tap water. Wring it out and fold it into halves or quarters so it can fit in your pouch. Lay the paper towel on top of the foil so the tobacco can stay fresh. Once the paper towel and foil are in place, seal the pouch so it’s airtight. If you don’t have paper towels on hand, you can try using a small section of sponge instead."

      "title": "Check your tobacco on a weekly basis to ensure that it isn’t moldy.",
      "content": "Check your tobacco on a weekly basis to ensure that it isn’t moldy. Open your tobacco on a daily or otherwise regular basis to see if your tobacco looks and feels fresh. If you see any signs of mold around the tobacco or paper towel, be sure to throw out the tobacco, foil, and paper towel."

      "title": "Rehydrate the tobacco if it looks dry or stale.",
      "content": "Rehydrate the tobacco if it looks dry or stale. Transfer your dry tobacco to an unsealed plastic bag. Boil a kettle of water on the stovetop, then wait for it to start actively steaming. At this point, place the open end of the back over the steam and physically tie the bag shut. Set your timer for an hour, then check on the tobacco to see if it’s moist again. [4] X Research source Repeat this process as needed to rehydrate your tobacco."
