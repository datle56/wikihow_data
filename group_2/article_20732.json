Click the cookie next to the \" Reincarnate \" button and you will see a screen with a cookie and a pedestal with a cookie on it. Click it and click \" Confirm \". Now click \"Reincarnate\" and you're all set. However, remember to check the number below the word Prestige . If the number below it is more than 0, click on the cookie next to the \"Reincarnate\" button immediately , press the text \"Born Again\", then click the \"Reincarnate\" button.

Since you cannot click the big cookie, which in turn means you cannot easily get cookies, the only way you can get cookies is by waiting for a Golden Cookie to appear, and clicking it, and getting the \"Lucky!\" result. At the start of the game, there is only one useful outcome for clicking a Golden Cookie: \"Lucky!\" which gives you 13+15% of your total cookies. [1] X Research source So, you'll need to get 2 Golden Cookies which give out the \"Lucky!\" outcome. In between these two cookies, you will most likely get \"Frenzy\" and other outcomes, because there is only a 20% chance that you'll get the same outcome twice in a row. Not to mention that Golden Cookies will take around 7 and a half minutes to appear. If it's Christmas season in-game, you can instead click a Reindeer which will grant you 25 cookies. Since a cursor is only 15 cookies, it'll be more than enough to kickstart your run."
