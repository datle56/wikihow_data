This adds an album called \"Hidden\" to your Albums list. On iOS 16 and later, everything in the Hidden album stays private and protected, even if Show Hidden Album\" is enabled. This means that if someone gets ahold of your unlocked phone, they can see that you have a hidden album, but they can't see what's in it without Touch ID or Face ID. On iOS 14 and iOS 15, the Hidden album is not protected by Touch ID or Face ID. To keep the album private, disable \"Show Hidden Album\" when you're finished looking at your private photos."
