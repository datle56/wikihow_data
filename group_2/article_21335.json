[1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Choose between organic beeswax or an oil like castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil, or Vitamin E oil. Use a clean mascara wand or cotton swab to gently apply the oil or wax to your upper lash line every night before bed. [2] X Research source Wait up to 12 weeks for full results. Castor oil has ricinoleic acid as its active ingredient, which may stimulate prostaglandin E2 (“PGE2”)—a molecule that’s been shown in studies to encourage hair growth. [3] X Research source Naturally refined coconut oil moisturizes your lashes, which can help them to avoid breakage and stay hydrated, leading to possible hair and lash growth. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Olive oil contains a high percentage of oleuropein, a compound that’s been found to induce anagen hair growth in some studies. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Vitamin E oil is an antioxidant that deeply conditions your lashes while also protecting the cells from external stressors.

      "content": "Apply lash growth serums to your lid line daily. Try an eyelash accelerator or growth serum to “help strengthen your lashes, allowing them to grow longer and stronger,” instructs licensed esthetician Alicia Ramos. Certified esthetician Karina Villalta also agrees that “the best way to grow thicker lashes is to use a lash growth serum,...[which] works by prolonging the anagen, or growth, phase of the lash hair.” Ramos specifically recommends two effective lash serums: GrandeLASH-MD and the LashFood Phyto-Medic Eyelash enhancer . To apply these over-the-counter serums, beauty specialist Barbie Ritzman instructs to “remove all eye makeup and ensure your lashes are dry. Then, use the applicator brush to apply a thin line of the serum along your upper lash line, similar to applying a liquid eyeliner.” “Use the lash growth serum once daily, preferably at night,” continues Ritzman. “Consistency is key for best results.” To prevent irritation, Ritzman warns against “applying the serum to the lower lash line…If you experience any irritation or redness, discontinue use and consult with a healthcare professional.”"

      "content": "Clean your lashes 1-2 times a day with a spooly. Brush your lashes at least once per day with a spooly (aka a clean mascara wand or eyebrow brush), and “do a once-through with an eyelash comb before you go to bed,” says Ramos. Your eyelashes naturally accumulate debris, face oils, and dead skin cells. [8] X Research source By combing a spooly through your lashes, you may be able to clear some of that debris and give your lashes more space to grow. [9] X Research source Spoolies are also super cost-effective, making this a great hack, and you can keep them in a small plastic container or baggy to carry around with you wherever you go!"

      "content": "Give your eyelashes a break from mascara and other makeup products. Over time, thick coats of makeup or heavy lash extensions can put too much pressure on your hair follicles and damage your fragile lashes. If you typically wear makeup every day, try dedicating at least one day per week to skip the mascara and give your lashes a chance to breathe. [12] X Research source Limit your use of other tools like eyelash curlers and false lashes to restore strength and volume to your natural lashes. “Harsh eye drops…can [also] diminish the strength of your lashes,” adds Ramos."

It’s crucial to remove eye makeup before bed in order to prevent lash breakage and eye irritation. [13] X Research source When washing your face, however, Ritzman stresses the importance of “avoiding any rubbing or wiping of your lashes,” as these motions can make your lashes fall out. To wash your eye makeup off in a gentle way, avoid makeup remover wipes and cleaners—instead, opt for organic, raw coconut oil or other oil-based eye removal products . [14] X Research source Use a cotton pad (not a ball or swap) or your fingertips to gently massage the oil onto your eyes. Then, rinse it away and pat dry. In addition to avoiding rubbing or wiping your lashes while washing your face, try not to pull or tug on them in daily life. It’s best to leave your eyelashes alone as much as possible, since even applying makeup or eyelash extensions too close to the last line can cause the lashes to fall out or break."

Start by washing your hands thoroughly, then gently place your fingertips along your lash line. Gingerly rub the area in small circles, making sure not to apply so much pressure that you might damage your lashes or eyelid skin.

One of the most popular FDA-approved lash growth treatments is called Latisse (Bimatoprost Ophthalmic Solution). [18] X Research source To start using Latisse, “visit a healthcare provider to get a prescription,” instructs Ritzman. Once you have the product, “clean your face thoroughly of makeup and remove contact lenses if you wear them.” Then, “use the sterile applicator provided by Latisse to apply one drop of solution to the applicator brush,” instructs Ritzman. “Apply the lash solution to the upper lash line of each eye, being careful to not let the solution contact other areas.” Apply Latisse once daily, preferably at night. According to Ritzman, “initial results are typically visible within 4-8 weeks, with full results expected in approximately 16 weeks.” “Potential side effects include itching redness, darkening of the eyelid skin, and darkening of the iris,” warns Ritzman. If you experience any of these side effects, temporarily discontinue use and contact the medical provider that wrote your prescription. Ritzman advises to “continue using Latisse regularly to maintain results. Discontinuing use will cause lashes to return to their original length over time.”"

Use a clean mascara wand to gently brush your eyelashes upward—this step can help to separate your individual eyelashes and make them look more voluminous and defined.

Gently squeeze the curler a few times and slowly move toward the tip of the lash on each squeeze. [19] X Research source"

If you want the look of long lashes without actually growing your lashes, a mascara advertised for lift and length is probably your best bet. Place the mascara wand at the base of your lashes and “squiggle the brush as you move upward,” instructs licensed aesthetician and makeup educator Daniel Vann. “Make sure to agitate the lashes and work the product into them. Don’t just graze over [the lashes] lightly and timidly…you really want to work into the lash vigorously.” You can also layer your mascara to create a thicker look, but Vann reminds us to “layer dry over wet,” not wet over wet. “Put a little [mascara] on,” says Vann, “step away from it, do another feature, then come back and layer a little more on. If you keep working at it too furiously when it’s wet, [the mascara] doesn’t ever build.”"

Eyelash tinting dyes your lashes to a darker shade, giving them the illusion of more fullness and length. Contact a local beauty salon or esthetician in your area to ask if they offer eyelash tinting. Ramos specifically recommends lash tints because “even good quality eyelash tint appointments can be the same price as, or cheaper than, expensive mascaras. And they last up to 6 weeks!”"

If you’ve torn off your eyelashes and are trying to repair them, this process can also take 6-12 weeks for your eyelashes to fully grow back. [22] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Make sure you’re being consistent with whatever strategy you’re using to promote eyelash growth —if you’re not applying your products frequently, you’re unlikely to see results. [23] X Research source If you’ve been consistently applying a serum or other growth enhancer for a few months without any results, you may want to try a different product. Keep in mind that eyelashes are constantly growing (and dying) in a four-to-eleven-month life cycle, and they only grow about 0.13 millimetres (0.013 cm) per day! [24] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Over that eleven-month cycle, eyelashes move through three phases: anagen (growth), catagen (follicle shrinkage), and telogen (rest). After the telogen phase, your eyelashes naturally fall out and the new lashes behind them begin their anagen phase. [25] X Research source For your lashes to grow as thick and healthy as possible, they need nourishment and protection throughout each phase of this life cycle."
