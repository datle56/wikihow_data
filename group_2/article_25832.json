      "content": "Be sincere and include a return envelope to get a response. Briefly introduce yourself and explain how LeBron has impacted you. Whether he inspired you to start playing or you think he’s the greatest of all time, get specific about what you admire about him. Finish off with a polite request to return your letter, send an autograph, or answer one of your burning questions. [13] X Research source When writing fan mail , use conversational language to showcase your personality. To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps and stickers. Be genuine to make your message more meaningful. For example, instead of saying “You're the GOAT,” you could say, “I have your quote, ‘You have to be able to accept failure to get better’ posted in my locker. It helps me stay motivated during practice!” If you’re requesting an autograph, send your photo in a properly stamped and self addressed envelope. It can take 6+ months to receive a response, so try your best to be patient. In the meantime, send fan mail to Cristiano Ronaldo , Lionel Messi , or another athlete you admire!"
