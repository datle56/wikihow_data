      "content": "Trim away any sharp edges if your nail is torn. If part of your nail rips off, use nail scissors to carefully cut away the detached portion and trim any jagged edges. This will help prevent what’s left of the nail from snagging on things, which could cause further pain and injury. [1] X Research source After you trim your nail, rinse it in cool water for 20 minutes. Carefully pat the area dry with a clean towel and add a little petroleum jelly, then cover the injured nail with a bandage. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow your doctor’s home care instructions if you had the nail removed. If a doctor surgically removed your toenail, they will probably provide special instructions for caring for the nail after the surgery. Ask for a written care sheet that you can take home, and don’t hesitate to ask questions if you don’t understand the doctor’s instructions. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source For example, your doctor may give you instructions on how to change your bandages and monitor your nail bed for signs of infection. They may also prescribe or recommend medications to help you manage any pain from the nail removal."

      "content": "Keep the injured toe propped up for the first 3 days after losing the nail. After losing a nail, you will likely have some swelling and inflammation in the injured nail bed. To minimize these symptoms and promote faster healing, keep your foot propped up as much as possible during the first few days after the injury. Try to keep the toe above your heart level. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source For example, you might lie down on the couch with your foot propped up on the arm, or lie in bed with your foot on a couple of pillows. Rest the toe as much as possible. Avoid walking or putting weight on the toe if you can help it."

      "content": "Avoid getting your toe wet for the first 1-2 days after losing the nail. For the first 24-48 hours after losing your nail, keep the area dry as much as you can. If you have to shower, put a plastic bag over your foot to keep it from getting wet. This is especially important if you have stitches in your injured nail bed. If you have a bandage on your toe, change it if it gets wet."

      "content": "Wash your injured toe with clean water after the first 2 days. Once your toe has had 24-48 hours to rest and heal, you can start rinsing the area with clean, warm water. Gently wash the area twice a day. [5] X Research source This will help rinse away bacteria, dirt, and fibers from your clothing or bandages. You can also wash the area with mild soap, but take care not to use anything with harsh perfumes or dyes that might dry out and irritate the wound."

[6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Before bandaging your injured toe, gently apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the nail bed. Your doctor might also recommend using an antibiotic ointment on the injured nail bed. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Protect your nail with a bandage while it grows in.",
      "content": "Protect your nail with a bandage while it grows in. If the skin underneath your nail is exposed, put on a non-stick bandage. The bandage can help prevent infection, and it may keep the sensitive skin of your nail bed from rubbing painfully against socks and shoes. [8] X Research source Change your bandage daily, or whenever it gets wet or dirty. Whenever you change the bandage, wash your toe and apply a new layer of petroleum jelly. Keep wearing a bandage until your new nail grows in enough to mostly cover your nail bed. While the injury is fresh, avoid adhesive bandages or bandages made with fibrous materials that might stick to the wound (such as gauze). One good option it to use a silk bandage and hold it in place with a toe sock. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear shoes that fit well to avoid further injury. If you wear shoes that are too small (especially high heels), you can easily bruise your toenails and aggravate your injured nail bed. Your toes will only have a small space to move during a long period of time, which can slow the process of regrowing the nail. [10] X Research source Also refrain from making sudden stops. When you're done running, for instance, steadily slow to a walk so that you don't pitch forward, and your toes don't hit the tips of your shoes. Wear breathable cotton socks instead of tights or pantyhose. Your doctor may recommend wearing an orthopedic shoe for a while to protect your toe and give it a chance to heal."

      "content": "Be patient as your nail grows in. You may be able to somewhat speed your nail growth with soaks and vitamins, but you'll still need to wait for the nail to restore itself. It typically takes 12-18 months for a missing toenail to grow back, so don’t be concerned if your progress seems slow. While your nail is growing back, don’t disturb it or chip at it. It may be tempting to pull off unneeded bits of nail, but you shouldn't mess with it unless it's a hangnail or an ingrown toenail ."

      "content": "Soak the nail in warm saltwater 2-3 times a day to prevent infection. A saltwater soak can help clean your toe, kill bacteria, and promote healing. Make a solution of 1 teaspoon (about 5 g) of salt and 4 cups (0.95 L) of warm water and place it in a large bowl or shallow tub. Soak your toe in the solution for 20 minutes, 2-3 times daily. [11] X Research source This treatment is most effective during the first few days after you lose your toenail. You may need to wait 24-48 hours after the initial injury before you can safely do a soak, so ask your doctor for instructions. You can also make an Epsom salt soak using 2 teaspoons (10 g) of Epsom salts with 2 US quarts (1.9 L) of warm water. [12] X Research source"

[14] X Research source If you’re using vitamin E oil as opposed to a cream or ointment, consider mixing it with a little petroleum jelly or a gentle moisturizer to prevent irritation and help hydrate the area. Wear open-toed shoes (or no shoes) for an hour after application, or until the oil has soaked into the skin. The effect will be stronger if you give your skin time to absorb the moisture."
