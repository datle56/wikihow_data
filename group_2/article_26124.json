      "content": "Set aside a quiet time for prayer. Woodford explains that prayer is the first line of communication to God and “the foundation for any religious practice.” [1] X Expert Source Olivia Woodford Holy Bible Expert Expert Interview. 2 May 2023. Pray about anything, from your troubles and sins to things you're excited about. Think of prayer like texting or calling up the Lord—what will you tell Him? There are several times when the Bible describes Jesus going to a quiet place to pray. If the Son of God needed prayer as part of His spiritual life, imagine how important it is for you. Follow Jesus' example and make it a priority to spend some time each day talking to God and listening for His guidance."

      "content": "Honor Jesus by giving your time and energy to other people. Even though He was God's Son, Jesus didn't come here and demand that others bow down and wait on His every need. He fed people who were hungry, healed people who were sick, and even humbled Himself enough to wash someone's feet. If you want to live your life for Him, treat others the way He did—by helping them when they're in need, forgiving them when they do things wrong, and loving them no matter what. [2] X Research source Try volunteering your time helping people in need in your community, like working at a soup kitchen or organizing a clothing drive. You can also serve people in a less formal way, like buying a sandwich for someone who's hungry or listening to a friend who's having a hard time. As Mark 10:43-45 states, “But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of everyone else. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give His life as a ransom for many.”"

      "content": "Tell people about God's love and Jesus' sacrifice. You're usually excited to tell your friends when you see a cool movie or eat at an awesome new restaurant, right? Well, in the same way, the best way to honor the amazing gift of Jesus is to share it with others. When you're spreading that love, you're truly living for Jesus and making Him the biggest priority in your life. [3] X Research source Try joining an outreach ministry in your church to spread the message of Jesus while helping people in need. In Matthew 5:14, the Bible says, “You are the light of the world.” This means you have the power to share the light and hope of God's word with everyone around you. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread love to live a life Jesus would be proud of. God loves all people, no matter their sins or their beliefs. Follow in His footsteps by doing the same—love all your neighbors! Show Jesus' love by encouraging and motivating others instead of criticizing them or putting them down. Be someone people can rely on, not someone who scrutinizes. As Leviticus 19:18 states, “Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself.” [5] X Research source Jesus commands in John 13:24, “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.” [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Lean on other Christians for support when you need it.",
      "content": "Lean on other Christians for support when you need it. Jesus was the perfect Son of God, but He surrounded Himself with companions—not just to teach them about God, but to help support Him. In Matthew 26:38, as Jesus was facing death, He asked His friends Peter, James, and John to join Him as He prayed: “Then he said to them, ‘My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.’” [7] X Research source Even Jesus needed support; there’s no shame in asking for help. Ask your friends to join you in prayer or read Scripture together. A faithful fellowship can help you all grow as you follow Jesus."

      "title": "Pray that God will help you be strong against sin.",
      "content": "Pray that God will help you be strong against sin. Being a Christian doesn't mean you'll never be tempted to sin. Everyone faces temptation, but you have the power through Christ to fight it. Lean on God’s word and His love for you when in doubt. Your faith makes you stronger than you think. [8] X Research source In Matthew 6:13, Jesus prayed, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” You can use this same prayer when asking God for help to avoid sin. [9] X Research source In 1 Corinthians 10:13, the Bible promises that you have the strength to overcome the urge to sin: “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability.”"

      "content": "Put too much faith in objects, and you may lose sight of God. Woodford reminds us that when you're living for Jesus, remember that your goal is ultimately to join God and do as much as possible to serve Him. [10] X Expert Source Olivia Woodford Holy Bible Expert Expert Interview. 2 May 2023. In other words, what's waiting in heaven is more important than on earth. Avoid focusing too much on obtaining money or your possessions. [11] X Research source You can have nice things and enjoy them—they're blessings from God, after all! Just don't let the pursuit of them distract you from serving God . In Matthew 19:21, Jesus tells a rich man, “If you would be perfect, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.” [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Make the Lord the most important thing in your life.",
      "content": "Make the Lord the most important thing in your life. God's very first commandment is not to put any other gods higher than Him. However, it's more than just not following another religion—it means not having anything in your life that's more important than God. Ask yourself, “Where do I turn when I’m upset? What makes me the most excited in life? Do these things glorify God?” By putting your faith first, you’re living for the Lord. [13] X Research source In Ezekiel 14:3, the Bible describes idols as “things that will make [you] fall into sin,” or something that distracts you from God’s word. Idols can include harmful habits and substances, but they can also be things like your career, friends, video games, or sports. If you're willing to lie, steal, or cheat to accomplish or obtain something, it's almost certainly an idol. The sin might be more subtle, like getting angry or being jealous of someone else if you can't have it. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Make time to analyze and understand God’s word.",
      "content": "Make time to analyze and understand God’s word. To live for and like Jesus, it’s important to know what He was like. The first four books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) tell us about Jesus' life and the lessons He taught. This is a great place to start studying God's word, but don't stop there! Jesus instructed us to “keep the commandments” in Matthew 19:17, making it clear that it's important to understand all of God's law in order to really live like Him. [15] X Research source Woodford recommends setting aside a little time each day to read your Bible. Even 5-10 minutes can help you understand the love of Jesus. It can help to do this at the same time every day, like as soon as you wake up, on your lunch break, or before you go to bed. [16] X Expert Source Olivia Woodford Holy Bible Expert Expert Interview. 2 May 2023. If you're not sure where to start reading, buy a devotional book or sign up for a daily newsletter from a local church. These will give you a specific Scripture to meditate on each day."

      "content": "Look to Him for guidance even when times are hard. In Romans 8:28, the Bible promises that everything you go through is part of God's plan for you: “And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good.” This is true even when you're faced with struggles or hardships. Have patience and know that the Lord always has a plan for you; you just have to have faith . [17] X Research source In Matthew 22:39, Jesus prayed that God would help Him avoid being crucified. And yet, He still acknowledged the perfectness of God's plan when He said, “Not as I will, but as you will.”"
