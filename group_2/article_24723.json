      "title": "Attach a metallic or plastic strip to the inside of the boot.",
      "content": "Attach a metallic or plastic strip to the inside of the boot. Metallic or plastic strips, like No Slouch Boot Straight, are rigid strips that you attach to the inside of the boot. These rigid strips keep the material from bunching up around the ankle or anywhere else and stick firmly to the fabric inside the boot. You could also make a metallic or plastic strip, or try using a long wooden craft stick, and attach it to the inside of your boot near the ankle."

      "title": "Use adhesive tape to hold them up.",
      "content": "Use adhesive tape to hold them up. Purchase an adhesive tape for boots, like Boot Stay or Boot Straps. Simply peel off the protective backing and stick the adhesive tape to the inside of the top of the boots. The adhesive tape will stick your boots to your pants or stockings and keep them from slipping down and slouching at the ankle."

      "title": "Wear a boot band to keep them from slipping down.",
      "content": "Wear a boot band to keep them from slipping down. Boot bands, like the Boot Bra or Snap Strap, have two parts. You stick one piece, which has the male part of a snap button, to the inside of the top of your boots. Then, you place the second piece, which has the female part of a snap button, around your leg where the top of the boot hits. The pieces snap together to keep your boots from falling down or bunching up."

      "title": "Pad the ankle area to reduce slouching.",
      "content": "Pad the ankle area to reduce slouching. Boots often slouch at the ankle because that area is narrower than the calf. One way to prevent this slouching is to the pad the area around the ankle to keep the material from bunching there. Wear tall, thick socks and bunch them, comfortably, around your ankle to fill in the gap between your skin and the material. You could also wrap a piece of cloth around the ankle if the boots are too tight to accommodate thick socks on your feet."

      "title": "Avoid stressing the material.",
      "content": "Avoid stressing the material. The more careful you are with your boots, the less they will slouch due to worn-out material. Avoid tugging, pulling, or roughly handling your boots, especially when putting them on and pulling them up. Try to smoothly slip your foot into the boot, instead."

    {
      "title": "Store your boots individually.",
      "content": "Store your boots individually. Don’t leave your boots lying in your hallway or piled under clothes or other items. Take care of your boots and provide them with their own storage space. Lay them flat in your closet with a piece of cloth in between them. Alternatively, you can hang each boot up using binder clips or boot clips."

      "title": "Stuff your boots to help them retain their shape.",
      "content": "Stuff your boots to help them retain their shape. You can purchase boot shapers to fill out the shape of the boot when storing them upright while they’re not in use. [1] X Expert Source Penny Simmons Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. Alternatively, you can stuff your boots with newspaper or rolled-up magazines, or cut pool noodles to fit inside them. This will keep your boots standing up straight while you're not wearing them, so they'll be less likely to slouch when you put them on.

      "title": "Choose boots that fit snugly.",
      "content": "Choose boots that fit snugly. If the boots are loose around your leg, they will definitely bunch up. Pick boots that are snug around the ankle and calf, but make sure they aren’t too tight at the very top, either. Try on several pairs and select the ones that contour to the curves of your foot, ankle, and calf the best."

      "title": "Select boots made of a sturdy material.",
      "content": "Select boots made of a sturdy material. Though you may love the look and feel of soft, suede boots, the supple material is going to slouch at the ankle. Choosing boots made from a more sturdy material can help prevent the material from bunching around the ankle. Rigid leather boots or boots with ankle support are the least likely to slouch."

    {
      "title": "Pick a pair of boots with zippers or laces.",
      "content": "Pick a pair of boots with zippers or laces. Boots that have zippers or laces will stay up better than those you simply pull over your foot and leg. Zippers and laces are natural supporters that will help the boot fit your foot and leg better, leading to less slouching. Ensure the laces or zipper tightens around your ankle to keep your boots standing tall."
