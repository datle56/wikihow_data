It can be as large or small as you'd like, but working with flowers smaller than about two inches across will be difficult. Around 4\" will work well. Cut along the line. Then use the first flower shape to trace the same shape on four to nine other pieces of fabric. Cut out all the flower shapes. To draw a flower shape, start with a circle, then draw half circles around the circle. If you want, you can print out and use of the templates provided here http://www.oneprojectcloser.com/make-fabric-flowers-tutorial/ . How many flower shapes of fabric you use depends on how thick the fabric you're using is. Make fewer when using thicker fabric."
