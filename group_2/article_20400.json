      "content": "Wear something flattering. Make sure you choose an outfit that's flattering on your body type. Something that genuinely fits is key. However, if you want to get noticed, it's okay to wear clothing that's slightly more sexual or revealing. You may want to wear clothing that's a little tighter than your normal style, if you feel comfortable doing so. Do not pick something that shows everything off, but do choose something that compliments your best features. If you prefer a low-cut front, for example, don't also go for a lower cut back. If you're proud of your back muscles, go for something low-cut in the back but higher in the front. [1] X Research source A suit can be great club wear, if you choose one that's not too dressy. A blue suit jacket, for example, worn without a tie can be a nice club outfit. [2] X Research source You can also go casual, but make sure to pick something flattering. Fitted jeans can help you show off your legs or, if you're curvier, your curves. A tighter t-shirt can work great. If you want to add a splash of formality, wear a nice blazer over a fitted t-shirt."

      "title": "Choose shoes you can dance in.",
      "content": "Choose shoes you can dance in. Wear shoes that you love. Uncomfortable shoes that are difficult to dance in are not the shoes you want to wear at the club. Choose something that goes well with your outfit and is stylish. Most clubs are dark. People aren’t usually going to be looking at your feet. [3] X Research source Select a comfortable shoe like flats or sneakers. This will allow you to dance flirtatiously, getting a guy's attention."

      "title": "Do your hair and makeup.",
      "content": "Do your hair and makeup. Keep in mind that if you’re dancing, sweat is likely. Wear makeup and a hairstyle that is going to stay in place through the night. For makeup, you might want to change your normal daytime style to something more dramatic -- stronger colors, smokier, more shine, etc. You can also opt for waterproof makeup products, as this may stay intact more throughout the night. You can use hairspray to keep your hair neat throughout the night."

      "title": "Practice dancing beforehand.",
      "content": "Practice dancing beforehand. Unless you’re a really experienced and skilled dancer, practice to some of your favorite songs. Have a friend watch and help you. You might think you’re dancing sexily, but it might just look uncomfortable -- we all need a little help sometimes. There are a lot of videos online that can help you figure out the best moves for you. [4] X Research source Try to keep your body loose while you dance. If you make a conscious effort to release tension, your dancing will look natural. This can make you look sexier, increasing potential male attention."

      "title": "Be relaxed.",
      "content": "Be relaxed. When you’re at the club, try not to be nervous (even though you probably are). Dancing in front of people can be nerve-wracking. Wait a few songs before you begin and watch what other people are doing. You don’t want to stand out so much that people stop and point. Figure out how you are going to fit into the dance floor. You might even want to wait for a song you know before you start dancing."

    {
      "title": "Start dancing.",
      "content": "Start dancing. If you’re nervous, dance with your friends. Work on getting more confident and more easily noticed. If you’re feeling strong, dance by yourself. This is often an invitation for a guy to come up and start dancing with you. Even if a guy doesn’t, you can be sure that a lot of guys will notice you dancing by yourself."

    {
      "title": "Study him.",
      "content": "Study him. Notice what he is wearing, how he behaves, what he drinks, and what he does in the club. For example, is he there to have fun with his friends, or does he just want to pick up potential romantic partners? This can tell you a lot, and help if you approach him. You might study him and realize that he’s there with a significant other, so you will need to move on to someone else."

      "content": "Start flirting. If you see the guy at the bar, go to the bar and buy something to drink. If he turns, make eye contact before looking away. You can even look him up and down while he’s watching and then make eye contact and smile, if you’re feeling adventurous. You can also: [5] X Research source Offer to buy him a drink. This is a fairly classic method of flirtation. Be friendly. If you're being openly friendly with a strange guy, he may very well take this as flirtation. Smile at him and even offer a compliment. You can say something like, \"Hey, I love your shirt.\" [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Try to start a conversation.",
      "content": "Try to start a conversation. Many men will be flattered if you try to engage them in conversation. [7] X Research source Get him to talk about himself, his opinions, and interests. Most of us like to talk about ourselves. If you’re really at a loss, ask about his tattoos (if he has any showing) or if he has any that aren’t. You can also use the following questions: Try a compliment. [8] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. You could say something like, \"You look athletic. Do you play sports?\" You could also try something like, \"That's a great shirt. Where did you get it?\" If you're both waiting at the bar, comment on this to strike up conversation. For example, say something like, \"Can you believe how crowded it is?\" After he responds, introduce yourself. Ask about him when starting a conversation. Find something you can observe about him and ask about it as a way to talk. For example, \"Excuse me, but what kind of beer are you drinking?\""

      "content": "Continue to show interest throughout the conversation. Once you have a guy hooked in conversation, make sure to send signals you're interested. Nod and smile to show you're listening. Maintain eye contact as he talks. [9] X Research source Pay as much attention to listening as you do to talking. If you appear interested in someone and what they're saying, this can appear flirtatious. Appear engaged. Talk in an animated voice, sit up straight, and smile on occasion."

      "content": "Decide if he’s interested. If you notice the guy flirting back a bit, you have successfully gotten his attention. If he responds to the eye contact and flirting, you have gotten him to notice you! You might want to continue flirting and talking, or take it to the dance floor. Now that he’s noticed you, it’s up to you where you want to take the night from here."
