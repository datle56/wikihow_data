Don't feel like you have to laugh at a joke you find offensive. It's more important to stick to what you believe in than to make him feel good about himself."

Also try letting out a small gasp, as if you just remembered something, and grabbing his arm or shoulder as you tell him what it is. Avoid touching his leg unless the two of you are close friends. This is a much more personal action that may come across too strong if you don't know each other well."

It’s a subtle but powerful way to act like you’re doing him a favor (because you are), while also getting physically closer to him. If you don’t know him very well, ask if you can do it, first.

You don’t need to know a lot, just enough to ask a question, like, “So is that the second or third movie in the series?” All that said, a conversation is a 2-way street, so don’t hesitate to talk about yourself, if and when he asks."
