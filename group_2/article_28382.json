      "title": "Brushing while wet can cause damage to your hair.",
      "content": "Brushing while wet can cause damage to your hair. Before you get into the shower, grab a brush or a wide toothed comb and start at the ends of your hair. Gently detangle and work your way upward toward your scalp, being careful not to tug or pull on your hair as you go. [1] X Research source If you have curly hair, you can wait until after your shower and brush your hair while it’s damp with a wide toothed comb."

      "title": "Hot water strips your natural oils from your hair.",
      "content": "Hot water strips your natural oils from your hair. Thankfully, you don’t have to take ice cold showers, either! Turn down your water temperature until the water is warm, but not scalding hot. It will help protect your hair and keep it from getting too dry after you wash it. [2] X Research source The optimal temperature is below 112 °F (44 °C). If your shower is steaming, it’s probably too hot."

      "title": "These ingredients can dry out your hair.",
      "content": "These ingredients can dry out your hair. When you’re shopping for shampoo and conditioner, look for bottles that say “silicone- and sulfate-free” on them. They won’t dry out your hair as much, and you’ll keep more of your natural oils on your scalp. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Also avoid products with alcohol in them, as that can dry out your hair too."

      "title": "There’s no need to get shampoo on every strand of hair.",
      "content": "There’s no need to get shampoo on every strand of hair. When you’re in the shower, get your hair wet and put a glob of shampoo into your hands. Rub the shampoo onto your scalp, and use your fingers to gently massage the product into your hair. When you rinse, the shampoo will run down to the ends of your hair and make sure it’s all squeaky clean. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Putting shampoo straight onto the ends of your hair can dry them out and cause damage. Plus, the ends of your hair are very rarely dirty or greasy. While it might feel good, try to avoid the temptation to scratch your scalp with your nails as you shampoo. This can damage your scalp and lead to issues like dandruff and irritation."

      "title": "Give your hair a little extra love every week or so.",
      "content": "Give your hair a little extra love every week or so. When you’re still in the shower, rub a hair mask or a deep conditioner onto the ends of your hair and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Wash the product away before you get out of the shower to give your hair extra moisture and shine. [5] X Research source Look for hair masks and deep conditioners with avocado oil, grapeseed oil, or olive oil in them for natural hydration. You can make your own hair mask by combining 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coconut oil, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil, and 1/2 cup (120 mL) of honey."

      "title": "Rubbing your hair with a towel can cause damage.",
      "content": "Rubbing your hair with a towel can cause damage. When you get out of the shower, gently squeeze out the excess water and blot your hair with a towel. Wrap it up to get the majority of the water out before you let it air dry. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you’re feeling fancy, try using a microfiber towel instead of a cotton one. They’re gentler and cause less frizz when you dry your hair."

      "title": "Aim for once a week at most.",
      "content": "Aim for once a week at most. Hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons can really dry out and damage your hair. When you do use them, make sure you spray a heat protectant onto your hair to keep it from getting too damaged.

Try using no-heat hairstyles, like braiding your hair while it’s wet to create soft waves."

      "title": "Wearing your hair up can cause breakage.",
      "content": "Wearing your hair up can cause breakage. If you love a slick bun or a high ponytail, try to let your hair down every once in a while. If you ever notice that your hair seems dry or brittle, give it a rest from being tied up all the time. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Try using a scrunchie instead of a hair band. They’re softer on your hair and they don’t tug as much on your scalp."

      "content": "The right nutrition can give you long, healthy hair. Make sure you’re eating plenty of lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and plant oils in moderation. Eggs, spinach, leafy greens, berries, and avocados are particularly good for your hair health.

      "content": "Protect your hair from harsh chemicals. When you go swimming, put on a swim cap and make sure all your hair is tucked tightly underneath. When you get out of the pool, take a quick rinse to avoid drying out your hair with chlorine. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you have blonde hair, it’s especially important to rinse afterwards. Chlorine can turn blonde hair green if it’s left in long enough. If you don't feel like wearing a swim cap, wash your hair with fresh, clean water and conditioner before jumping into the pool. The clean water will act like a barrier and prevent your hair from soaking in any chlorine or salt.

If your hair grows slowly, you could even push it to every 2 months. [13] X Research source Trims don’t help your hair grow faster, but they do help your ends look fuller and healthier."

      "content": "Cotton pillowcases cause a lot of friction. When you go to bed, switch out your pillowcase for a silk or satin one to smooth down your locks while you snooze. You can find fairly inexpensive pillowcases online or at most home goods stores. [14] X Research source Silk pillowcases can also help maintain your natural curls overnight."
