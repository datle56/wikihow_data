[Take Poll] A relationship between a 1 and a 6 is often emotionally secure and supportive."

So reducing the number 15 would involve adding 1 and 5 to get 6. First, start by reducing the month, day, and year to a single digit each. Next, add those three numbers together. Lastly, reduce the final sum until you get a single number. [23] X Research source To find the life path number of someone born on March 9, 1993, you would do the following calculations: Month : 3 Day : 9 Year (first reduction) : 1993 = 1 + 9 + 9 + 3 = 22 Year (second reduction) : 22 = 2 + 2 = 4 Life path number (first reduction) : 3 + 9 + 4 = 16 Life path number (final reduction) : 16 = 1 + 6 = 7 The life path number for someone born on March 9, 1993 would be 7."
