      "content": "Take off Barbie’s clothing and accessories and give her a rinse. Find a nice tub or sink that is deep enough for you to dip her into the water. If she is filthy, wash her body with soap or washing up liquid. Do not do this on wood floors."

      "content": "Use shampoo or soap to clean Barbie’s hair. For a smooth finish, soak her hair with fabric softener and then rinse it with water. You can also brush shampoo and conditioner through her hair and wash it out thoroughly. Then, let her hair dry."

      "content": "Use a small pick comb and pick out knots. Some Barbies come with small brushes to comb her hair. A wide-toothed comb can also help remove tangles and mats."

      "content": "Take some scissors and cut Barbie's hair into a new style. Try doing something simple like short hair or a bob, or add layers if you like. Don't hold the hair between the index and middle finger while cutting; it will stretch out and might come shorter than expected. If you are young, ask an adult for help with cutting Barbie’s hair."

      "title": "Use Kool-Aid to dye Barbie’s hair a fun color.",
      "content": "Use Kool-Aid to dye Barbie’s hair a fun color. If you want to be creative and funky, you can dye Barbie's hair using Kool-Aid. Massage some Kool-Aid powder into her hair (as well as enough water). Dry her hair and then wash out any remaining powder. It should wash off using hot water and soap. Washable markers work well, too. If you don't like the Kool-Aid idea, you could use a permanent marker such as a Sharpie to color her hair. But remember, a permanent marker is permanent. If you don't want to dye her hair at all, you can temporarily use a fluorescent highlighter to give Barbie some awesome highlights. The liquid in a highlighter is not usually permanent, so if you are not satisfied, you could try again. Another way to temporarily dye Barbie's hair is to use washable markers. You can use washable markers and color directly onto Barbie's hair. However, being washable, this dye will wash out. As another alternative, dye Barbie’s hair with paint. Mix conditioner and the paint color you chose in a cup, then paint the color in the doll's hair. Let Barbie’s hair dry, which takes about 1 day. Then, wash out the paint (the color will still be there) and let her hair dry."

      "content": "Make some new clothes out of scrap fabric. If you have experience sewing or you know how to, find some really neat fabric. Try designing a cool fashion for Barbie and sew it together. If you hate your current Barbie outfit, you can just alternate it to suit your liking (like sewing on beads, etc)."

      "title": "Use acrylic paint and a small paintbrush to add makeup.",
      "content": "Use acrylic paint and a small paintbrush to add makeup. You can use black for eyeliner, red for lips, pink for cheeks, etc. You can soften the acrylic paint colors by adding water. After the paint has dried, go over the paint with a matte finish to make sure the paint stays on the Barbie. If you want to remove the makeup from Barbie before you start painting her, you can remove the makeup by using pure acetone and a cotton swab. You can finish off her lips with some petroleum jelly to provide a lovely shine to those lips, or you can use a clear gloss acrylic paint. Never, ever, ever use ink on a doll of any kind, especially a Barbie. The ink will expand on the vinyl and permanently change and damage your Barbie. So do not use a pen to create her makeup, unless you want to end up with a ruined doll."
