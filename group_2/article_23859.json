This is especially helpful if this is the first time you are using a diaphragm. If you schedule an appointment with your doctor, the procedure takes around 10-20 minutes and you may experience some discomfort during the fitting.

Knowing the pros and cons of using a diaphragm is vital and allows you to choose the proper contraceptive method for you. [22] X Research source Unlike hormonal contraceptives, diaphragms do not produce hormonal related side effects or risks. Diaphragm does not interfere with intercourse and can be inserted several hours before intercourse begins. You are in control of your contraception. During the insertion process, using diaphragms can become uncomfortable because some women are not comfortable touching themselves. Cases of diaphragm dislodgement during intercourse may result to unwanted pregnancy. Diaphragms do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Women using diaphragms are at higher risk for urinary tract infections. Note: UTIs respond easily to medical treatments. If you have a UTI or experience frequent UTIs, seek medical attention. Urethritis (infection of the urethra) and recurrent cystitis (infection of the bladder) can be caused by upward pressure of the diaphragm rim against the urethra. Diaphragms increase the risk of toxic shock syndrome especially if used improperly. To prevent toxic shock syndrome, use proper hygiene methods before inserting or removing your diaphragm and do not leave your diaphragm in for more than 8 hours after sexual intercourse [23] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source"
