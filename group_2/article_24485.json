      "title": "Kindle Unlimited is worth it if you read a lot of books or magazines.",
      "content": "Kindle Unlimited is worth it if you read a lot of books or magazines. If you don't read a lot, you might be paying more for the subscription than the book or magazine is worth, meaning that Kindle Unlimited isn't worth it for you. It might be worth it if you're part of a family group so multiple people can read the same book without paying for it repeatedly. If you qualify for a free trial, you can see if you like the service. There may also be discounts for the subscription service that make it worth it."

      "title": "Kindle Unlimited offers unlimited reading and listening.",
      "content": "Kindle Unlimited offers unlimited reading and listening. Yes, you read right. You can read books or magazines OR listen to as many audiobooks as you please. You can also download up to 20 books, audiobooks, or magazines at the same time!"

      "title": "Pros:",
      "content": "Pros: Read anywhere from your Kindle or using the Kindle mobile app (so you can read on your smartphone or computer even if you don't have a Kindle device). Over 4 million books, audiobooks, magazines, and comics. Easy to explore new authors. (You won't be as annoyed or frustrated as you would be if you rented a physical book and now have to return it prematurely, or spent money on a book and ended up disliking it. Instead, you can return the book with the tap of a button.) Trendy and viral books might be available. Seasonal updates (for example, when the holidays roll around, there are more holiday-themed books available). You can listen to books if you don't have the time to read them. No hard deadline to return reading material."

    {
      "title": "Cons:",
      "content": "Cons: Not every author, book, or magazine is available. It's a pricey subscription fee if you don't read a lot. You need an internet connection to download anything."

      "content": "Here are some alternatives that are cheaper for you to try: Libby - You just need a library card, and you're good to go! Download the Libby app for your iPhone, iPad, Android, Amazon Fire tablet, Windows PC, Mac, or Chromebook, then sign in with your library card. Search for the book you want to borrow, and it will appear in your \"Shelf\" so you can read it! Libby offers free access to ebooks, digital audiobooks, and magazines. [1] X Research source Prime Reading - This is free if you're already an Amazon Prime member and you can access it the same way you would access Kindle Unlimited, through the Kindle app or web browser. Prime Reading has a very limited selection compared to Kindle Unlimited, but this might be worth it if you aren't an avid reader. Google Play Books - While there's no monthly subscription for renting books, a lot of books also aren't available to rent. Instead, search for your book and see if there's a renting rate. This is the better option to KU if you don't want to pay a monthly subscription, but just need to borrow a specific book. Check your library in the Google Books app to see how long you have left in the rental. [2] X Research source Kobo Plus - Like Kindle Unlimited, Kobo Plus is a reading subscription that offers access to both ebooks and audiobooks. Depending on your preferences, you can sign up for a plan that offers just ebooks, just audiobooks, or both! The first 30 days are free for new subscribers, so you can test it out before you commit to spending money. [3] X Research source Everand - This subscription offers access to unlimited ebooks, audiobooks, newspapers, magazines, podcasts, and even sheet music. Like many of the other options listed here, Everand offers a free 30 day trial. [4] X Research source"
