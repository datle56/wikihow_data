This will serve as the base for the tetherball pole and will be cemented into a tire. [1] X Research source Be sure to measure the rebar carefully; the crossbar won’t fit inside the tire otherwise."

      "content": "Secure the pole to the base. Weld a 10-foot (3 meter) long piece of 2-inch (5 cm) pipe vertically to the center of the welded cross bars. Alternatively, you can drill holes in the pipe and use 16.5 gauge rebar tie wire to secure the steel rebar to the pole."

      "content": "Install a hook for the cord. Weld an eye bolt about 2 in (5 cm) from the top of the vertical pole. This bolt will hold the cord that is attached to the ball. Alternatively, drill a hole at the top of the pole using a ⅜ in (9.5 mm) drill bit. Attach a washer and ¼ in (6.4 mm) by 2 in (5 cm) eye bolt. Secure the bolt on the inside of the pole with one washer and a ⅜ in (9.5 mm) nut."

      "content": "Secure the pole with concrete. Mix concrete well, per its label instructions, and fill the tire with wet concrete, cementing the tether ball pole firmly in place. [2] X Research source Use a level to make sure your pole is completely vertical. Use wire to attach your pole to a ladder or other tall structure to ensure it stays in place while the concrete is drying."

      "content": "Allow the concrete to dry fully. You will typically need to dry the cement overnight, but check the manufacturer's label for specific instructions. [3] X Research source Remove the garbage bag from the bottom of the tire once the concrete is dry."

Make sure your knots are secure so neither the cord nor the ball comes loose. [4] X Research source Some tetherballs come with a cord attached; if this is the case, use that instead of the rope."
