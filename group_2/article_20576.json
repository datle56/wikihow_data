      "title": "Be clean and organized in all aspects of your life.",
      "content": "Be clean and organized in all aspects of your life. “Pick up after yourself and be conscientious of cleanliness and hygiene,” advises Garbis. Virgo men tend to veer on the side of perfectionism and may be turned off by messy partners. If you invite your Virgo man over, keep your place clean—he may be turned off by a floor that needs sweeping or a sink full of dirty dishes. Put effort into your appearance and overall hygiene by cleaning your clothing and showering regularly. Don’t wear anything with stains or holes, and make sure to run a lint roller over your clothes prior to going out. When out to eat, eat slowly and avoid slurping or spilling your food. Keep your napkin on your lap at all times. If you are a neat person who pays attention to the details, then you and this Virgo may be well-matched. However, if organization and tidiness are not your style, he may not be the one for you."

      "title": "Avoid any flashy displays of materialism.",
      "content": "Avoid any flashy displays of materialism. Virgo men tend to value modesty and find showy displays of wealth to be tacky and distasteful. Rather than worrying about material things like gifts or expensive trips, focus on building a connection with your Virgo man that’s based on your shared values and interests. Virgo guys appreciate a deep emotional connection above all else, so taking this approach will win you a lot of brownie points with your man."

    {
      "title": "Plan dates that appeal to his senses and intellect.",
      "content": "Plan dates that appeal to his senses and intellect. Virgo men value intellect, but they also value beautiful sensory experiences. To plan a perfect date with a Virgo man, choose a cultural event like going to a museum, seeing a play, attending a planetarium show, or visiting a local art gallery. Or, curate a sensory experience like cooking him a delicious meal or taking him to a pottery class."
    },
    {
      "title": "Show up to your plans on time.",
      "content": "Show up to your plans on time. Punctuality and good manners are hugely important to the Virgo male, so showing up late for plans may make him think that you don’t value his time. If he begins to view you this way, he may lose interest in you, so make your best effort to show up to events on time (if not early)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Show off your hard work and talents.",
      "content": "Show off your hard work and talents. A Virgo man loves people who take pride in who they are and what they do—from lifelong passions to daily chores. [1] X Research source So, he might be turned off by people he perceives as lazy or complacent. If you have a job, for example, strive to be the best employee you can. Pay close attention to small details, be on time every day, and use downtime to learn more about your company. Continue to show off your skills and work ethic outside of the office by keeping a neat home and staying active in different hobbies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask him questions about himself.",
      "content": "Ask him questions about himself. A Virgo man likes to know that you have a genuine interest in getting to know him, so try to ask him open-ended questions that will reveal his inner thoughts and feelings. Pay attention to his answers and practice active listening so that he knows you’re interested in the conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Engage in intellectually stimulating conversations.",
      "content": "Engage in intellectually stimulating conversations. Virgos are thought to prefer people who can carry on an intellectual discussion. If this sounds like your man, you may want to read up on what is going on in the world and strike up a conversation about the latest happenings. [2] X Research source Download a few news apps on your phone, like apps put out by the New York Times, that send you regular updates about recent news stories. Put CNN on in the background while you cook dinner or turn on a radio show that talks about current events. Read books and watch documentaries about a variety of topics and in a range of genres."

    {
      "title": "Make him laugh with funny stories and witty jokes.",
      "content": "Make him laugh with funny stories and witty jokes. The \"typical\" Virgo man is considered serious by nature, so he may be drawn to someone who can get him out of his head. Try flirting with lighthearted, observational jokes like jokes about the weather or cute puns. As you get to know your man's sense of humor, start with jokes that aren't too edgy or raunchy. [3] X Research source If raunchy is your sense of humor, that's fine, and you don't have to change it for him, but it's best to feel things out a little before launching into a naughty limerick or off-color jokes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Present yourself with confidence and self-assurance.",
      "content": "Present yourself with confidence and self-assurance. Virgo men are highly picky, so they appreciate someone who’s confident in exactly who they are. Being overly needy or seeking approval can be a real turn-off for this sign, so presenting yourself in a confident manner will go a long way with the Virgo (even if you’re just faking it ‘til you make it!)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play it somewhat coy.",
      "content": "Play it somewhat coy. The typical Virgo is a little slow to show emotion. You may want to try to be subtle in your emotions if your guy has this trait, but if you're a naturally emotional, affectionate person, don't feel pressured to behave in a way you're not comfortable. Do what feels natural, and watch the guy for cues. [4] X Research source If he's uncomfortable with your level of emotion, you may want to dial things back until you get to know each other better. When a bond is built, a Virgo man will enjoy displays of affection, but you have to win him over first. Play it cool during communication. Make sure he knows you're interested in him by returning his texts and phone calls, but avoid being too excited. Go for a response like, \"Thanks for inviting me out. I look forward to it.\" A more enthusiastic response, like, \"I can't wait to see you!\" may put off a Virgo man."

    {
      "title": "Be direct and honest about your feelings.",
      "content": "Be direct and honest about your feelings. Although you don’t want to come off as overly emotional or needy to the analytical Virgo, it’s good to be honest and sincere. Virgo men really don’t like playing games when it comes to their relationships—their pragmatic personality will pick up on and reject insincerity right away. But if you’re able to communicate your feelings in a calm and collected way, you’ll definitely impress your Virgo man. “It’s very hard to get a Virgo to open up and chase you,” says Garbis. “But if you make yourself open and available and not a hard target, that might get a shy and receptive sign like Virgo to approach.”"

      "title": "Be kind and loyal.",
      "content": "Be kind and loyal. If your man is a typical Virgo, he will be very dedicated to his partner, and he will expect as much in return. Virgo men also have very little patience for unnecessary drama. Be loyal to your Virgo man and avoid baiting him into unnecessary arguments. While you should never put aside your own feelings, try to avoid arguments. If your Virgo man upsets you, approach him in a calm, kind fashion. Say something like, \"Could I talk to you about something that bothered me? I just want to make sure we talk it out so it doesn't affect our relationship.\""

      "content": "Be nurturing as you encourage him to come out of his shell. Virgo men can take a while to open up and be vulnerable, so they really need a nurturing and soothing environment around them. Show him that you understand his feelings and encourage him with kind words any time he decides to open up to you. Garbis recommends that you “listen to them and let them talk when they need to talk and let them complain without stepping in.” Additionally, make sure his needs are met in your relationship and try to frequently demonstrate your affection with kind words and caring acts.

      "content": "Be patient and let things flow naturally. Virgo men are deep thinkers and may take a while to make a decision about a partner. If you're looking for a whirlwind romance, you might not get that from a Virgo man. It may take him a while to commit, so strive for patience while dating your Virgo man . [5] X Research source Try not to pressure your Virgo man for a commitment early on. While the wait can be frustrating, remember that Virgo men are kind, loving, and loyal. You will have an extremely kind, caring significant other if you allow a Virgo man to come to you. Respect his boundaries during this waiting period. If this guy likes to take it slow, then slow your pace to match his. Some people take longer than others to decide if they want to be physical or enter into a relationship with someone, so respect his feelings and follow his lead. When it comes to physical intimacy, watch his body language and ask him outright to make sure he’s okay with every step of your physical relationship."

      "title": "Allow him to pursue his own work.",
      "content": "Allow him to pursue his own work. If your Virgo is passionate about his hobbies or work, it may be important for you both to be good at doing things independently and having a little \"me\" time. Virgo men do not do anything halfway, and a Virgo man is sure to put his all into any pursuits. [6] X Research source A Virgo man may be very dedicated to work. Allow him to do his job without interference. If your Virgo man has hobbies, expect him to take them seriously. Try to support his passions. For example, your Virgo man may be on a sports team.

[7] X Research source Try to do something active each day, even if it’s as small as some light stretching or a lengthy walk. Get outside as much as possible and eat nutritious meals .

      "content": "Accept his intensity. You can expect a Virgo man to be intense; it's just part of his nature, and it's unlikely to change. A Virgo man tends to take everything seriously, including your relationship. Once he's ready to commit, he will be intense about the commitment. This intensity can be a good thing, as you'll have a loving and loyal partner, but he will also be intense about work, school, and hobbies. You need to accept this to be with a Virgo. [8] X Research source Allow your Virgo man the time he needs to pursue his passions. He may get very serious about matters that seem silly to you, but try to accept this. It is just in his nature. If you aren't interested in the same things, take that time to pursue your own passions. Remember, his intensity will ultimately benefit you. You want a partner who's intense about you, as this will spell out a long-term commitment."

Since it can be hard to tell if a Virgo is serious about you , you may have to take charge and make it perfectly clear how much you like your Virgo guy and just see how he reacts. Your confession may make it easier for him to reveal his own feelings, and if he doesn’t, then you might be better off as friends. [12] X Research source"
