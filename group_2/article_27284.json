      "title": "Separate the garlic cloves.",
      "content": "Separate the garlic cloves. Peel each head of garlic and separate all the cloves of garlic within each head. The amount of garlic powder you wish to make will depend on how many garlic cloves you use. Each head of garlic will have about 10 cloves; sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. [1] X Research source For a smaller batch of garlic powder, use one head of garlic. For bigger batches, use more."

      "title": "Peel the garlic cloves.",
      "content": "Peel the garlic cloves. You can use your fingers to peel away the skin on the clove, or crack open the skin with your knife. Simply place a clove on your cutting board, and lay your knife directly on top of the clove. Gently push on the knife and garlic clove to loosen and crack the skin around the clove. [2] X Research source You don’t want to push down too hard on the clove, because you want to keep the clove whole, and in tact so you can slice it. Use your fingers to peel off the skin away."

      "title": "Thinly slice each clove.",
      "content": "Thinly slice each clove. Use a knife to slice off the root ends of the cloves. [3] X Research source These ends are tough, and not necessary for flavoring. Then use your sharp chef’s knife to thinly slice the cloves of garlic. Slice the garlic cloves about ¼” thin lengthwise, or even thinner if you like. [4] X Research source When all the garlic cloves are sliced, place them on a baking sheet or a dehydrator sheet lined with parchment paper. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry the garlic in an oven.",
      "content": "Dry the garlic in an oven. You can dry the garlic in an over or a dehydrator. If you’re using an oven to dry out your garlic, preheat your oven to one of the lowest heat setting. On most ovens, this is between 150 and 200° Fahrenheit. When your oven is completely heated at a temperature between 150°F and 200°F, place the sheet of garlic into the oven and cook for about an hour and a half to two hours. [6] X Research source While the garlic is drying, you can check on it and stir the garlic bits around to ensure they are drying out evenly. [7] X Research source Remove the sheet of garlic from the oven and let the pieces cool. You'll know that the garlic is thoroughly dry when the pieces snap, break, and crumble easily in your hand.

      "content": "Dry the garlic in a dehydrator. If you’re using a dehydrator to dry out your garlic, set the temperature to a lower setting, at about 125°F. Allow the garlic to dehydrate for about 8-12 hours. [9] X Research source When you remove the garlic from the dehydrator, the garlic bits should be brittle to the touch. [10] X Research source That is when you’ll know that they are completely dried."

      "content": "Grind the dried garlic. You can use a coffee grinder, blender, food processor, spice mill or mortar and pestle to grind up the garlic pieces. [11] X Research source Grind the garlic to your desired consistency. Sift through the powder with your fingers and remove any large chunks. These chunks can be gathered and reground. [12] X Research source Grind the garlic for a shorter amount of time if you want the powder to be chunkier. Grind the garlic for a longer amount of time if you want the powder to be finer. Allow the garlic to sit in the grinder for about 10 minutes. [13] X Research source This will allow the garlic bits and their fumes to settle, so you don’t breathe in the harsh garlic odors."
