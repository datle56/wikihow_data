      "content": "If you have a 4-Wheel-Drive system on your vehicle, select the 4-HI setting, or if you really want to take the extra time and make it as absolutely difficult as possible, enable the 4-LO mode. By enabling the 4-wheel-drive system (automatic 4-wheel-drive doesn't count, you have to select a full-time mode), the drivetrain is all locked together, and requires all four wheels to move together. By selecting 4-LO, the low gearing will undoubtedly hold the vehicle where you parked it. Don't forget to disable 4WD when you decide to leave, otherwise damage may occur to the drivetrain when operating 4WD on pavement."
