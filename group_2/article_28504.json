[1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Measure and record the width and height of the inside of your window frames, then purchase blinds that are sized to those measurement, rounding down to the nearest 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) to ensure a snug fit.

      "content": "Mount blackout curtains above your windows for added darkness. Blackout curtains sit in front of your windows, and like blinds, prevent excess sunlight from seeping through. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Install a curtain rod about 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) above the window so the curtain covers the glass completely. Secure your blackout curtains to the curtain rod , double-checking that the material covers the entire window. [4] X Research source Secure the edges and corners of the curtains to the wall with painter’s tape or command strips to reduce any light that may bleed through past the edges of the curtains. Use a double rod to hang multiple curtains, increasing their ability to block the light."

      "title": "Block out the windows with foil or blackout fabric to block sunlight.",
      "content": "Block out the windows with foil or blackout fabric to block sunlight. If you’d rather not fuss with hardware, add a layer of blackout fabric to your windows instead. A layer of aluminum foil also works well. Measure the dimensions of your window panes and trace these measurements onto a sheet of fabric or aluminum foil. Cut out the measured fabric and stick it in your window with a few strips of painter’s tape . If the fabric isn’t wide enough to cover the window, overlap several sections of fabric and secure them together with tape. Blackout film is similar to blackout fabric, but is an adhesive film applied directly to your windows after measuring and cutting it to size. If you don’t have foil, blackout fabric, or film, opt for black trash bags, cardboard, or something similarly opaque. Placing decor like potted plants or shelving in front of your windows also helps to intercept any light."

      "content": "Turn off all electronics in the room. Look through your room for any devices that might glow during the night, like your phone, TV, or computer. Turn off or unplug any devices that you don’t use during the night—you can always plug them in again once you wake up! [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Or, simply flip your phone face-down so its light doesn’t bother you while it charges. For instance, turn your TV off completely instead of leaving it on a standby screen."

      "title": "Stick electrical tape over any light sources you can’t turn off.",
      "content": "Stick electrical tape over any light sources you can’t turn off. Look for light-up screens that are essential to your routine, or which you can’t turn off, like an alarm clock or a surge protector. Instead of unplugging the device, place strips of dark electrical tape over the lit-up areas to block their light. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Remove the strips when you wake up so you can check the time again. This is a great solution for small, lit surfaces, like a fitness tracker that you’ve plugged in to charge. Or, place smaller items like watches in an opaque bag or box to hide them away."

      "content": "Cover your face with an eye mask for extra support. Don’t leave anything to chance when you go to sleep—even if your room is dark, wearing a sleep mask helps to block out any extra light your eyes may be taking in. Put on the mask when you plan on going to sleep, which can make it easier to fall asleep during the day.

Check that the snake or towel is snug, and that no light can get through the bottom of the door. This has the added benefit of dampening any noise that might filter in from other rooms.

      "content": "Rearrange your bed to face away from any windows. Reposition your bed so you aren’t facing a window or other light source, or so that it’s as far away from any light sources as possible. Even if your windows are blocked out, you may have an easier time getting to sleep if your bed is facing a different direction. Ask a friend or family member to lend a hand if your furniture is unwieldy. Also add room dividers around your bed to help seclude it and insulate it from any light sources."

      "content": "Paint your walls a darker color to absorb light. If you’re looking to make a long-term change, think about changing the wall color altogether. Dark colors tend to absorb more light than lighter colors. [9] X Research source This may help dissipate the light in the room. You could paint your walls black for the best effect, but consider darker hues of other colors in order to make the space more comfortable. [10] X Research source For example, a dark red or brown may lend your bedroom a cozy feel. A dark or navy blue , on the other hand, may help you achieve an even darker atmosphere. If you can’t paint your walls, hang dark room tapestries or other dark-colored wall decor like posters or picture frames to absorb as much light as possible."
