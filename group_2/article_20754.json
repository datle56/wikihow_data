From there, travel southeast until you reach a ruined building with a turret. There’s a chasm on the northeast side; climb to the bottom and follow the tunnel until you see a ladder. At the top is the Bonny Village ; go east until you reach the Bridge Leading to the Village Site of Grace , then north. [1] X Research source That north road will lead to the Church District Entrance Site of Grace , which you can activate. Sites of Grace allow you to teleport from place to place. The instructions above assume you haven’t been to the Church District yet, but if you’ve already activated the Church District Site of Grace, simply teleport there!"

Go left to find and activate the Storehouse, Back Section Site of Grace .

[6] X Research source There’s another Fire Knight waiting at the top of the ladder with its back turned to you, so decide how you want to deal with it.

Climb it, then go forward, right, right until you reach a second ladder, and use it to climb back down. [7] X Research source For the final right turn, you’ll need to sprint and jump to reach the second ladder! Before climbing to the first ladder, you can collect 7 Thin Beast Bones around the corner. After taking the first left at the top of the ladder, you can loot 4 Smithing Stones from a corpse. Finally, at the base of the second ladder, you can loot 4 Rada Fruit from a corpse."

[8] X Research source However, there’s a Fire Knight at the top of this ladder; be careful, as it may try to knock you off the rafters with a wind spell. If you’re knocked onto a lower platform, look for the lift below you and drop onto it to ride it back up to the right level. It’ll bring you to the Fire Knight’s area again, so be prepared! On the level where the lift is, you can also explore a bit to find 1 Rune of the Unsung Hero on a corpse."

From the Shadow Keep, Back Gate Site of Grace, you can also go straight forward to face Commander Gaius . You must defeat this Remembrance Boss to get 5 Scadutree Fragments by the Scaduview Chalice."
