      "title": "Heat your curling iron.",
      "content": "Heat your curling iron. To get long lasting Marcel waves, you will need a hot curling iron. Turn on your curling iron about 15 minutes before you want to use it. This will help to ensure that it is hot when you begin making the Marcel waves. Set the temperature on the curling iron to a temperature that is appropriate for your hair type. For example, you should set the curling iron temperature to 300 degrees. However, coarse hair may need a temperature of 400 degrees to achieve the style you want."

      "title": "Start with clean, dry hair.",
      "content": "Start with clean, dry hair. The look will last longer if you start with clean hair. Wash and dry your hair before you get started. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin. Use a hair dryer if necessary. If you have fine or thin hair, then you can add a little mousse or hairspray before you get started. This may help to add some extra volume to your look."

      "title": "Brush your hair so it is tangle-free.",
      "content": "Brush your hair so it is tangle-free. Using a curling iron on tangled hair may result in a messy look. To ensure that your waves look as lovely as possible, make sure that you brush all of the tangles out of your hair. Run your fingers through your hair to make sure that it is tangle-free."
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide your hair into sections.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into sections. The waves will look better and last longer if you divide your hair into sections and only work on one small section at a time. To do this, you may need to pull back some of your hair and work from the bottom layer of your hair. Try clipping up most of your hair on top of your head. As you finish a layer, let down a little more of your hair and keep doing this until you have finished waving all of your hair. If you have very short or fine hair, then you can probably just work on all of your hair at once rather than dividing it into sections. It's a good idea to decide where you want to part your hair before you divide it into sections. A side part is the most common for Marcel waves."

    {
      "title": "Clamp a piece of your hair near the root.",
      "content": "Clamp a piece of your hair near the root. To start creating Marcel waves with the curling iron, clamp the iron onto a piece of hair that is a couple of inches away from your root. Remember to clamp only a small section of hair at a time for best results. If you clamp too much hair, then the waves may not set or hold properly. Try to clamp only about ½” to 1” piece at a time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the hair into an S shape.",
      "content": "Bend the hair into an S shape. For Marcel waves, you do not roll all of the hair onto the iron as if you are curling it. Instead, just roll the iron towards your root slightly and hold the other end of the hair around the barrel so that the hair is bent into an S shape. Hold the hair this way for about 15 to 30 seconds and then release. Your hair will now have its first Marcel wave."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move further down your hair.",
      "content": "Move further down your hair. Next, move the curling iron a couple of inches past the first wave on the same piece of hair. Then clamp the piece with the curling iron and bend the piece into an S shape as you did the first time. Hold it for 15 to 30 seconds and then release. Continue clamping and bending the first piece of hair until you reach the bottom of the section. Then, start at the root for a new section. Continue doing this until all of your hair has Marcel waves."

    {
      "title": "Set your hair with some hair spray.",
      "content": "Set your hair with some hair spray. Marcel waves are meant to be voluminous, so you may not want to use too much product. However, using a bit of hairspray can help the look to stay longer. Try misting your hair with a light layer of hair spray to finish your look."

      "content": "Wear it down or up. The Marcel wave can add glamour and texture to an updo, or it can create volume and texture for your hair when you wear it down. Style your hair however you like. A popular updo for the Marcel wave is a chignon or low bun. This look was especially popular in the 1920s for women with bobs, but it looks great with just about any length of hair. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Shape it into a single big wave if you want a retro look. After your curls have set, you can use a brush and pins to create one big wave, as the style was worn in the past. Use the brush to smooth the hair into a single wave, then pin it in place."
