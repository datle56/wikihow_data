      "content": "Use long side lunges to target your butt muscles. For increased intensity, you can also add dumbbells. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands on your hips. Putting your hands on your hips will force you to use your core muscles for balance. If you're using dumbbells, keep your arms straight down by your side. Still facing forward, move your right foot about 2 feet (0.6 m) to the right. Bend your right leg as you put your weight on your right foot; your left leg should stay straight. Keep both feet pointing forward and your hands on your hips. Push off with your right heel to return to the original position. Repeat the exercise on the left side; do 3 sets of 10 reps if you're using weights, or 20 reps if you're not using weights."

Place your toes on the floor so your heels are in the air. Push your body into the air with your arms, making sure to keep your body straight and contract your buttocks and thighs. Repeat until you start to feel tired. Take a break, and then do some more.

If you want to tone your arms more with this maneuver, you can add dumbbells and a bicep curl as you come up.

Another way to track how many calories you're eating, and thus, reduce them is to keep a food diary. Just write down everything you eat in a day, including portion sizes, then calculate your calories using an online calorie counter. You can also find apps for your phone that will help you count calories."

In addition, the extra fiber will help you feel fuller. [13] X Research source Remember when you're grabbing a salad that not all salads are healthy.

[16] X Research source Always look at food labels. Foods can have added sugars without you even realizing it, such as breads, dressings, and condiments. Don't forget that sugar can be under other names, such as \"high fructose corn syrup,\" \"molasses,\" and \"sucrose.\" Add other flavors to replace the sugar.

If you curve at your hips and thighs, opt for a bikini with a high cut, as other bikinis may cut you off strangely. In addition, this cut will add visual inches to your legs, making them appear longer. Try a string bikini, as it can accommodate your curves. [23] X Research source If your problem area is your stomach, opt for boy shorts with stomach control. Not only will it slim down your stomach, the suit will highlight you summer-ready bikini butt. [24] X Research source If you are larger in your butt and thighs, try a bikini with ruffles and a small skirt. A small skirt can help hide problem areas, and ruffles add length, meaning you can adjust it up or down as needed. [25] X Research source If you're athletic, try a string bikini. String bikinis add less bulk to your already muscular body. [26] X Research source Avoid shiny materials. Shiny material will show every bump on your body, highlighting problem areas.
