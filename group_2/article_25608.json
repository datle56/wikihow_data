      "content": "Ensure you have an even number of eyelets for bar-lacing. Check to see if your skate shoes have an even or odd number of eyelets (lace holes) on either side. You can straight-lace any pair of Vans with an even number of eyelets. If your Vans have an odd number of eyelets, you may have to adjust your technique slightly. [1] X Research source Most Vans have about 7 or 8 eyelets. However, shoes can have as few as 4 and as many as 9. Don’t count the top eyelet, as you’ll be using this pair of holes to tie your shoes."

Keeping the left lace on the left side and the right lace on the right side, thread your shoelace through the bottom 2 eyelets. This will create a bar across the bottom with the laces going inwards. [2] X Research source Some Vans shoes come with the bottom part of the shoe already laced. If your shoes arrive out of the box like this, skip this step. Pull to ensure that both the left and right sides of your shoelace are equally long. If one side is longer than the other, re-thread the lace accordingly."

This will hide the inner lacing and give this style its unique look. [3] X Research source Whether you go by your right or the shoe's right doesn't matter. The end result will be the same, as long as you stay consistent in your threading."

Repeat as necessary, continuing to reverse sides after every 2 bars are completed. If your shoes have an odd number of eyelet pairs, skip lacing the last 2 eyelets (the eyelets furthest from your toes).

You will now have a bar and 2 cross-laces in your lacing. Pull the newly-crossed lace to the right (away from the shoe) to get it out of the way. If you want a looser lacing style, tug on the tongue and/or sides of your Vans every so often to free up some tension in the cross-laces. [10] X Research source Sk8 Highs and other Vans high tops tend to look better with this looser, cross-laced stitching style."

Start by crossing the lace on the right-hand side over to the left side and downward through the eyelet, making sure that the other lace emerges from between the two crossings. Pull the newly-crossed lace to the left to get it out of the way. Then, cross the left lace over to the right side. Repeat until the shoe is completely laced. Lacing the shoes this way ensures that the cross-laces always go in one direction over the other lace. When the time comes to lace your other shoe, reverse the process so that your laces mirror each other. Leave a few eyelets empty if you want more room for your foot to maneuver. Lace all your shoe’s eyelets if you want a more snug fit."

To begin a zipper-laced pattern, thread your shoelace downward through your Vans’ bottom pair of eyelets, with an equal amount of lace on the left and right side. Zipper lacing provides extra tightness in the shoe, because it locks at each pair of eyelets. [11] X Research source This is especially helpful for Vans Old Skools and other, flatter Vans."

Feed the left lace toward the 3rd-bottom right eyelet and the right lace toward the 3rd-bottom-left eyelet. Thread your laces in the direction of the toe upward. [13] X Research source Because of the zipper-like pattern, the stitching pattern in the 2nd-to-bottom eyelets will look more diagonal than bar-laced.

Loop the laces under the row directly beneath them and feed them through the pair of eyelets directly above them diagonally. It’s likely there won’t be much lace left to tie when you’ve finished looping a zipper-lace pattern. If this is the case, simply tuck what’s left of your laces under the tongue of your shoe. The pattern itself will be tight enough to keep your Vans from falling off."

Each time you pull your laces through the eyelets, slowly flatten them out to keep them from twisting up and looking uneven. [15] X Research source Don't over-tighten your laces. This can cause them to bunch together and mess up the look. Feel your laces to ensure they’re firm when you take your Vans out of the box for the first time. If your laces are soft and floppy, you may have been given fake Vans and further inspection is required."

      "content": "Use thick white laces. Vans laces are usually the best laces for Old Skools, high tops, and other types of Vans. However, any variety of white sneaker lace will work. In general, skate laces are pretty puffy and white, whereas basketball and other sneaker laces are thinner and more cylindrical. Use any color of laces you like, but new white laces are the most commonly associated with Vans."

      "content": "Change up the way you lace your shoes. To get the most life out of your shoes, alternate between the styles you use when you lace them. This way, they won't wear from repeated lacings. If you bar-lace your shoes, cross-lace them every now and then to keep them looking new. If you cross-laces your Vans, change the direction of the crosses, so that the right side isn't always over the left, or vice versa. This will help to keep the shoes from wearing unevenly."
