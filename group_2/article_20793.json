You want the customer to leave with the same value they gave you, only now part of that value will be the product, and the rest change. It’s that simple. [1] X Research source For example: If they gave you $20 to buy a $5 book, they will leave with $5 worth of book plus $15 worth of change, for a total value of $20."

      "content": "Add up the amount the customer gives you. Before you can make change, you'll need to know how much money you've been given. As you count the money, place it on the register or table in front of you both. When you are done counting, state the amount paid. This will ensure that there is no confusion or disagreement about how much the customer gave you."

      "content": "Count out loud to avoid confusion. You don’t need to count out every single coin, but it is important to at least call out the running total whenever you reach the end of a particular unit such as pennies, nickels, dimes, or quarters. With bills mistakes are more costly, so it’s a good idea to keep a running count. For example, if you were given $10 for a $6 product, you would either: Count the one dollar bills and then give the total: “One, two, three, and four makes ten.” Or add up as you go: “Seven, eight, nine, and ten.”"
    },

      "title": "Start with coins.",
      "content": "Start with coins. Do pennies first, then nickels, dimes, and quarters before handing out paper money. When you give back change the other way around, it's awkward and your customer is more likely to drop the change as they are already holding the paper money. If your customers drop your money when you pass it to them, this is probably why. [3] X Research source In our initial example, you are starting with $7.59 (the price of the sandwich), so you would hand back: 1 penny (“that’s $7.60”) 1 nickel (“7.65”) 1 dime (“7.75”) 1 quarter (“8.00”) While this is the most efficient combination of coins, it doesn’t really matter how you add up to $8.00, so long as you get there."

      "content": "Consider doing a bit of subtraction first to make things simpler when dealing with more complex transactions. It may not be immediately obvious how to get from $12.78 to $23.03. Here is where a little initial subtraction can simplify things: [5] X Research source Start with the amount paid. Subtract from it to get a simpler number. In this case, 23.03 – .03 = $23.00. Now subtract the same amount from the price: 12.78 – .03 = $12.75. It's clear now that you'll need to first give back a quarter. 1 quarter takes you from $12.78 to $13.03.

They give you 6 twenties, a nickel, and a penny. [6] X Research source Add the amount paid by counting up as you put the money down: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and six cents. Tell the customer the amount paid: \"$120.06\". The customer gave you a bizarre amount of change, so this might be a good time to do a bit of subtraction. 120.06 - .06 = $120.00, and 112.31 - .06 = $112.25. Better. You need 3 quarters. Now start adding up from $112.31 to $120.06. 3 quarters (\"takes us to 113.06\") - We know this works from our earlier subtraction exercise. 2 one dollar bills (\"114, 115\") 1 five dollar bill (\"and 5 is 120.06\") Check your work: You gave .25 + .25 + .25 + 1 + 1 + 5 = $7.75. $7.75 + $112.31 = $120.06 – the amount the customer paid."
