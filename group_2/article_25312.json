      "title": "Open the Messages app.",
      "content": "Open the Messages app. Looking at message information is not as reliable of an indicator as using test calls. However, some information displayed underneath iMessages can be helpful in determining if someone has blocked you."

      "content": "Open the conversation with the suspected blocker. Check underneath the last message you sent."

      "title": "Check for a \"read receipt\" below the last message.",
      "content": "Check for a \"read receipt\" below the last message. Many users have read receipts turned on, so if you no longer see \"Read at...\" underneath your sent messages you might have been blocked, or the person may have turned off read receipts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for a \"Delivered\" receipt under the last message.",
      "content": "Check for a \"Delivered\" receipt under the last message. If you used to see \"Delivered\" when messages were sent and no longer do, you might have been blocked. The \"Delivered\" receipt is known to show inconsistently, so this method may not always be reliable. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Call the person you think has blocked you.",
      "content": "Call the person you think has blocked you. Using a test phone call is one of the more reliable indicators as to whether or not someone has blocked you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to the way the call is received.",
      "content": "Listen to the way the call is received. If you hear exactly one ring and are then sent to voicemail, you may have been blocked. Just because your call goes straight to voicemail doesn't mean you have been blocked. Your contact's phone may be dead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call again to see if your results differ.",
      "content": "Call again to see if your results differ. If you receive the same result after calling a couple times, it's a good indicator that the person you're trying to reach has blocked you or has a dead phone. Users are not notified if they are receiving a phone call from a blocked number."

    {
      "title": "Dial \"*67\" before your contact's phone number.",
      "content": "Dial \"*67\" before your contact's phone number. You can use a masked number to double check the status of another person's phone."

      "title": "Tap the green call button.",
      "content": "Tap the green call button. Doing so will start a call without your contact information appearing to the recipient."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to the way the call is received.",
      "content": "Listen to the way the call is received. Many people avoid answering calls from blocked numbers, but if you hear the call going through like a normal call should, you may have been blocked. If the call goes directly to voicemail after one ring, your contact's phone may be dead."
