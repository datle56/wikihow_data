      "title": "Identify the information contained in a docket number.",
      "content": "Identify the information contained in a docket number. A docket number identifies a case as it makes its way through the court system and appeals process. If you are a defendant or party to a civil case, you'll need this number to file documents on your own behalf. If you interview an attorney to take your case, they may ask for your docket number so they can research your issues. Also, with the docket number, you can follow cases that you are interested in by tracking the documents that are filed by all parties and the court. The docket number is critical if you want to order copies of documents from the federal court archives. In most cases, criminal and civil proceedings are public record. Anyone who knows the docket number can look at the public file. Some courts, including federal court, are fully computerized and all the documents are accessible via their website. In state courts, you may have to ask to see the public file at the courthouse. Cases involving juveniles are usually not accessible to the public. In divorces, reports dealing with child custody, such as psychological evaluations, are not public record. The court clerk may not even give out a docket number for a juvenile case. Courts keep a running diary of the court's actions in the case files. These case notes can summarize appearances, court dates, arrest warrants, convictions, and sentencing. Since people may be involved in more than one issue, you'll need to know the docket number to ensure you are following the right case."

A state court docket number is very different from a federal court docket number because the two systems have different coding procedures."

      "content": "Interpret the information contained in the docket number. Knowing a few simple codes, you can tell a lot about a court case by looking at the docket number. Court case numbering conventions vary by jurisdiction, but there are some similarities. If a docket number includes the code \"CR\" it is probably a criminal case, either a felony or misdemeanor. A \"CV\" code typically stands for a civil case. A \"J\" in the code usually means it is a juvenile case and you will have difficulty getting information about the proceeding. Juvenile cases are often confidential to protect the child's identity. A typical state court docket number will include the county, the year of filing, the case type code, and the numerical file number. Therefore a Kansas court case styled \"BB-2014-CR-550\" was filed in Bourbon County (BB,) in 2014, as a criminal case (CR,) and was the 550th case filed in 2014."

      "content": "Understand the federal docket numbers. Court dockets are a collection of all documents and materials related to a particular court proceeding. When a case is opened, the clerk assigns it a docket number. That number will not change, even after the case is resolved. Federal docket numbers usually reference the year the case was filed, a reference number, alpha case-type codes, the location of the filing, and the initials of the judge(s) assigned to the proceeding. For example, a federal docket number might look something like: 1:15-cv-03849-ABC(DEF) The 1 refers to a specific filing location. The 15 indicates that the case was filed in 2015. The cv indicates that it is a civil proceeding. The 03849 shows that it was the 3,849th case filed during that year. The ABC represents the initials of the district judge the case was assigned to and the DEF are the initials of the magistrate judge."
