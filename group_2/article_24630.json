      "title": "Determine if you qualify.",
      "content": "Determine if you qualify. In good conscience, make sure that you can answer the following questions in the affirmative. Am I a Catholic gentleman who is in union with the Holy See and who practices the precepts of the Catholic Church? Am I 18 years of age or older? Am I willing to give my time? Your commitment can be as little as twenty-four hours in a year, or as many hours as you are able to dedicate to charitable work."

    {
      "title": "Approach the process patiently.",
      "content": "Approach the process patiently. There are four degrees of membership and it takes up to a year to progress through them all. The ceremony for each level focuses on one of the core values and you must progress through them in order. You are considered a full member of the Knights of Columbus once you have attained the Third Degree. An initiate becomes a First Degree Knight of Columbus through the exemplification ceremony. Subsequent degree ceremonies, each focused on one of the four principle virtues, are held throughout the year. Members who have been in the Knights for one year (six months with special approval) and have attained Third Degree membership are eligible to join the Fourth Degree. The Fourth Degree color guard are the members of the Knights of Columbus you see with the regalia (cape, chapeaux, and sword). Participation in the Honor Guard is voluntary, and not an automatic part of becoming a Fourth Degree Knight. Fourth Degree members are encouraged to participate in this highly visible arm of the Order."

Each member belongs to their local council, which is typically connected to a specific parish. The districts and jurisdictions connect these local groups and aid in regional planning.
