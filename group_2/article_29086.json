For example, you could say, \"The dress looks good on you!\" You could also say, \"You know, you're really smart! You always seem to have the right answer in class.\" Another option is, \"You have the best hair! I love how full and healthy the wave is.\" Or, be sincere and, if you really like her eyes you should say something like, \"Hey I really like that shade of blue on you, it really complements those beautiful eyes.\" Don't get too carried away.

      "content": "Poke fun of yourself. Poking fun at yourself shows you don’t take yourself too seriously, and that’s an attractive quality. Plus, any time you can crack a joke, even at your own expense, will help to make a girl smile, and it can help lighten up any tension in the room that may be the cause of the girl's frown. This type of humor works especially well when you do something a little silly or clumsy. For instance, if you trip over your shoelaces when she's around, you could say, \"If only someone had taught me to tie my shoes, I wouldn't be in this situation.\" It can also work if she does something clumsy. You can take the attention off her by poking fun at yourself. For instance, you could say, \"That wasn't clumsy. Let me tell you about clumsy. One time, I tripped on my own shoe and went tumbling down the stairs. Now THAT was clumsy. What you just did was just cute.\""

[8] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021. Some of the main ingredients of a good joke include finding the right target, having the element of surprise, exaggerating everyday life, and having the basis of truth. [9] X Research source The \"target\" refers to what you tell the joke about. When telling a joke to someone, the target should be relevant to their interests. For instance, telling a combat joke to a teenage girl may not make much sense, since she's (likely) never been in combat. The surprise is the twist to the joke that makes it funny. Exaggerating makes it funny because it takes it beyond the every day while still keeping an element of truth. For example, if you're eating together in the cafeteria, try cracking a joke about the food. You could say something like, \"This food is so terrible my dog would turn up his nose at it.\""

You could even employ some slapstick humor, such as \"accidentally\" spraying yourself with the water fountain by holding your thumb over the stream. Be aware that slapstick could backfire if the girl just finds it ridiculous. It could also backfire and hurt you if you are not careful enough. Think about what makes you or your friends laugh, as she'll likely find some of the same things funny."
