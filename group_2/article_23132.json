Professional matchmaker and dating coach Lauren Sanders suggests asking your partner about their romantic preferences to build intimacy. Talking about love and romance helps create a flirty spark between you. It can also help you understand what they want in a relationship. Try one of these to get started: If you had to describe the feeling of falling in love in one sentence, what would you say? Suppose we had a chance to kiss anywhere in the world. Where would it be? Imagine we’re going out on the perfect date night. Would it be casual or fancy? If you could make the perfect partner, what personality traits would you pick? If a genie offered to create the ideal relationship, would it be monogamous, polyamorous, or open? How connected are emotional intimacy and physical intimacy for you? Do you need to have one to enjoy the other? If you could only have one type of kiss for the rest of your life, which would you want it to be? Imagine seeing the perfect person. What physical qualities would they have? If we just met, how long would it take you to realize there was chemistry between us? Do you think it’s better to have a specific “type” or be attracted to lots of different types of people?"
