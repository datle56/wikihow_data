Enter this code at http://www.starbucks.com/rewards . Then, follow a series of prompts to enroll in the Rewards program.

      "content": "Use your registered card to purchase products at Starbucks stores. Using the physical or virtual card that you just registered or created, spend money on food, drinks, or other products at participating Starbucks locations. You will earn two “Stars,” or virtual reward units, for each U.S. dollar that you spend using your card. [5] X Research source You must use the exact card that you registered to earn stars. If you are using another card, it must be registered to the same rewards account as your original card. You can't earn Stars while loading new money on your card, or while purchasing alcoholic beverages. Products sold in other countries will earn Stars as if their value were expressed in US dollars. For instance, if you spend 1 Pound at a Starbucks location in the United Kingdom, you will earn two stars (the same amount you would have earned if you had spent 1 dollar)."

The amount of Stars that you earn by entering Star codes from purchased products will vary depending on what you bought and how much you paid for it. Star codes expire about a year after the product's “Best by” date. Be aware of this if you're trying to enter a code from a product that you purchased a while ago. [7] X Research source"

Make sure the entirety of the receipt is visible and legible in the picture that you upload. If not, your submission may not be approved, and you may not earn any Stars."

Then, you'll be able to use your Gold card to continue accumulating Stars. You can easily transfer the balance of your old registered card to your new gold card by logging into your Starbucks account, selecting “Manage”, then following the transfer prompts.

To accomplish this, continue buying drinks and snacks as often as possible at Starbucks locations using your Gold card, or any other registered card. [11] X Research source To earn stars for other Starbucks products you purchase outside of stores, upload your receipts or enter Star codes from the products online. This is an especially good idea if you have only been earning Stars at Starbucks locations, but are now struggling to collect enough Stars to maintain your Gold membership. Monitor your Star balance on your mobile app or by visiting http://www.starbucks.com/account to make sure you're on track to reclaim your Gold status next year."
