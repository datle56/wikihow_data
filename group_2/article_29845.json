      "content": "Stir some liquid soap into the water. You can use just about any type of liquid soap, including: body wash, dish soap, and hand soap. Keep stirring until the soap has completely dissolved and no streaks remain. [2] X Research source Plan on using about 1 part soap to 10 parts water. [3] X Research source You can also add liquid glycerin . The glycerin will react with the silicone and cause it to clump together. [4] X Research source"

Squeeze enough of the silicone into the bowl to cover your desired item with. [5] X Research source Construction silicone may also be labeled as silicone caulk. If your tube of silicone did not come with a syringe, you will need to purchase a caulking gun , insert the tube, cut the end off, then poke a hole in the tip. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the silicone while it is submerged. Put on a pair of plastic gloves, and reach into the water. Grab the silicone with your fist and squish it together. Knead it until it is no longer sticky while keeping it under the water. This will take about 5 minutes. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Form the putty into a thick disk. Begin by rolling the putty into a ball between your palms. Press it against a flat surface, and lightly push down on it. It still needs to be thicker than the item you will be molding. [8] X Research source If the silicone is sticky, coat your hands and work surface with a thin layer of your liquid soap.

It may be dry and crumbly at first, but keep kneading. If it is too sticky, add some more cornstarch into it. [15] X Research source You may have some cornstarch leftover in your dish; this is fine. The silicone will have picked up all the cornstarch it needed."

Also, make sure that the design portion of your item is facing up, and the back is pressed against the tape. [22] X Research source Flat-backed items work the best for this.

Some types of silicone are supposed to be measured by volume, while others need to be measured by weight. Read the instructions that came with your silicone closely, then measure them accordingly. Pour the silicone into the cup included with your kit. If your kit did not come with a cup, pour the silicone into a plastic, disposable cup. You need enough silicone to cover your items by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters)."
