Do a few sets of 30 to 50 grips in each hand with a grip or ball of your choice. Stress balls are usually palm-sized balls that you can squeeze to exercise your hand. Don't have one?

Baoding balls are Chinese stress-relief balls that can be used to exercise your hands. To use them, you rotate two balls around in your palm. They make nice sounds and help you exercise your hands."

      "title": "Do wrist exercises.",
      "content": "Do wrist exercises. Wrist-strengthening exercises have the added benefit of increasing your grip strength, as you hold the weight that you're using. You can do wrist-strengthening with bands, hand-weights, or other household items. Hand weights: Grip a small amount of weight (3 to 5 pounds) in each hand, your palm facing toward the ground. Flex your elbow up so your arm comes out straight, letting your wrist hang down. Flex your wrist slowly, making your arm straight. Then let it back down slowly. Do three sets of 10 to 15 reps with each hand. If you don't have hand-weights, use cans of soup, bricks, or any other hand-sized objects. Exercise bands: Stand on one end of the band and grip the band with your hand, palm facing down. Lift your arm until it comes out straight, then flex your wrist slowly as you grip the band, making your arm straight. Do three sets of 10 to 15 reps with each hand."

      "content": "Do finger push-ups. If you're in relatively good shape but still struggle with slightly fatty fingers, start doing more advanced push-ups. Instead of doing push-ups with your palms flat on the floor, do them with your palms raised and your weight on your fingertips. Shoot for doing a few sets of 5 to 10 reps. Do a couple more sets of regular push-ups in addition to your fingertip push-ups. Push-ups help to strengthen your wrists and your pectorals, both good for all-around upper body strength and weight loss."

      "content": "Eat less salt. Excess sodium can cause water retention, which results in mild swelling, specifically in the hands and feet. If you want slimmer hands, cut the salt from your diet.

Many packaged and frozen foods, even vegetables and sweet snacks, are extremely high in sodium. You can eat a lot of salt without even realizing it. Pay attention to the serving sizes as well. Many \"Reduced Salt\" or \"Reduced Sodium\" options are basically the same product with a manipulated serving size, to reduce the sodium content per serving."

      "content": "Choose healthier snacks. You can gain lots of extra weight from eating unhealthy between-meal snacks.

Dump the snack cakes and chips and keep fresh fruits and vegetables around, so you won't have the choice. Have an apple. Apples are low in calories and high in fiber. Don't skip dessert, but make your dessert a bit healthier. For example, instead of having a bowl of after-dinner ice cream, switch to a cup of low-fat Greek yoghurt and frozen blueberries. Or, if you love a piece of chocolate cake every now and then, then keep an antioxidant-rich dark chocolate bar around, and eat a square (just one) when you get a chocolate craving."

      "content": "Eat more slowly. Research suggests that one of the best ways to curb your hunger cravings is to chew more and eat more slowly. If you struggle with overeating, slow down and wait for your body to catch up. Start your meal with a small cup of broth-based soup, or eat a small handful of unsalted almonds 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. This has been shown to reduce the amount of food you consume in the subsequent meal. Don't skip meals. Some studies show that skipping meals, especially breakfast, forces the body to store the calories you consume later in the day more quickly. In other words, skipping breakfast makes you gain weight.
