      "title": "Wash your face at least twice a day.",
      "content": "Wash your face at least twice a day. Remove oils and debris from your face every morning and night to get clear, glowing skin. If you work outside or are sweating more than usual, you may want to wash your face more frequently. Use mild, unscented, and dye-free soap and water. Check the ingredients. In most cases, a mild soap is enough to keep your skin free from blemishes and give it a healthy glow. Make sure products don't contain peroxide and alcohol. These ingredients strip protective oils from the skin, leading to dry, uneven complexion. Body washes often contain harsh dyes or fragrances. If you want the aroma therapy experience of using your favorite scented body wash without exposing skin to potentially damaging chemicals, add one teaspoon of the scented body wash to each ounce of wash that is more gentle. You’ll get the clean, moisturized skin you need and the fragrance you want."

      "content": "Use a tissue to assess your skin type. An hour after you wash your face, run a tissue over your forehead and the bridge of your nose. If the tissue is oily, you likely have an oily skin type. If the tissue reveals flakes of skin, you likely have dry skin. If you have oily skin, you’ll want to look for products that are light lotions or foams rather than heavier creams and masks because oil on the skin may create a barrier sealing creams or masks onto skin and clogging pores. If you have dry skin, avoid soaps that have alcohol and peroxide, and apply moisturizers more liberally. Alpha hydroxy acids, AHAs, are good for anti-aging and keeping an even skin tone , but they can be drying so patients with dry skin should use them sparingly. Glycolic acid is good for oily skin and lactic acid is good for dry skin. Use a facial treatment with enzymes to smooth and brighten skin tone no matter what your skin type. Vitamin C is also essential to protect and repair both oily and dry skin. Use a product with sulfur once a week to reduce oil on the skin without drying. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use different products for day and night. Your skin has different needs according to the time of day. In the morning, you want to prepare your skin for the rest of the day. Start by using a gentle cleanser to soothe your skin. Next, apply toner if that is part of your routine. Most importantly, you want to choose a daytime moisturizer. Ideally, a daytime moisturizer should contain SPF. It should also be light, and should not make your skin feel oily. At night, you want to use a thicker, richer moisturizer. Retinols and peptides are good ingredients to look for, as they can help repair your skin overnight.

      "content": "Clear up acne with peroxide and salicylic acid. When celebs get pimples, they may have to put their film shoot on hold, hide from paparazzi, and otherwise worry about ending up on the “celebs without make up” page. Many of these celebrities rely on dermatologists to give them amino acid therapy with light catalyst a few times a year to avoid these breakouts all together. However, professional therapies can cost as much as $4000. Instead, you should consider using a cleanser with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to treat chronic breakouts. They don’t work as quickly, but you’ll start seeing a difference within a few weeks. These products range from ten to fifty dollars. [3] X Research source"

Even if you don’t get sunburns, sunscreen is essential to protect your skin from UV rays, pollutants, and harsh weather conditions. Choose sunscreens that are oil free and at least SPF 15 or higher. Sunscreen typically wears off after three hours, so bring sunscreen with you and reapply often for best results. You may also want to consider a moisturizer and sunscreen combined to simplify your care routine. Consider sunless tanning. A high quality sunless tanning lotion offers a sun-kissed glow without exposing skin to the sun. Additionally, they even out skin tone, block UV rays, and moisturize. [5] X Research source You can also consider professional sunless tanning to give the entire body a consistent color and give skin a healthy-looking glow."

      "title": "Moisturize throughout the day.",
      "content": "Moisturize throughout the day. Don’t assume one application of sunscreen or moisturizer will keep your skin moisturized and protected all day. Skin that’s exposed to ultraviolet light, smog, rain, wind, and other elements needs to be retreated periodically, and most sunscreens are ineffective after just three hours. Reapply a moisturizer or sunscreen every three to six hours for optimal effect. [6] X Research source If you have extra dry skin, consider steaming. You can buy steamers specifically made for facials that cost between $25 and $100, but it’s just as effective to use a boiled pot of water. Bring the water to a fast boil, remove it from heat, and lean over the pot allowing the steam to cover your face for about ten minutes. Pat skin dry and apply moisturizer. Applying moisturizers improves circulation, preventing the loss of collagen that leads to an increased appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. [7] X Research source If you have oily skin, look for moisturizers that are specifically made to reduce oiliness, and always choose oil and petroleum free products."

      "content": "Adopt healthy habits. It's important to lead a healthy lifestyle to keep the skin on your face and body free from blemishes and glowing beautifully. There are a number of daily habits you can adopt to improve your skin and your overall well-being. Sleep eight hours a day. Beauty sleep is no joke. During rest, the body heals and rejuvenates itself. Without adequate sleep, your skin cells are unable to repair, and over time, this can result in skin with a dull appearance. Eat fruits and veggies. Not only are these foods good for your health, they also contain vitamins and minerals essential to keeping skin healthy. Choose foods high in vitamins A, C, and E as they help to protect skin and heal damage. Cut out foods with a lot of sugar, grease, and/or oil as they can cause blemishes or give you oily skin. Limit sodium intact as it can cause puffiness and swelling. [8] X Research source Be sure to drink water. [9] X Expert Source Kimberly Tan Licensed Esthetician Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. Water flushes toxins out of the body, hydrates from the inside out, and improves skin’s elasticity. Avoid stressful situations. Relaxation is proven to promote improved whole body health and skin clarity. Going to a spa is a great way to relax and receive great skin treatments all at the same time. Smiling and laughing have been proven to clear skin, and research suggests this is due to the stress relieving effects of laughter.

Ask the doctor, \"What specifically should I do to care for my skin every morning/evening/throughout the day?\" Take notes about specific care products.
