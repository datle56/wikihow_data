      "content": "Use a wearable male vibrator. A wearable male vibrator increases blood flow to your penis, resulting in harder, longer-lasting erections. Tenuto 2 by MysteryVibe is an FDA Class 2 device clinically proven to help with ED and performance anxiety. This male vibrator has four motors that send powerful vibrations all along the penis and perineum (the skin between the penis and anus), which increases circulation and sensations for a firmer, fuller erection. It sits comfortably, yet snug at the base of the penis to restrict blood to the penis, keeping erections lasting longer, and doesn’t require removal to ejaculate, which is beneficial for couples trying to conceive. Additionally, three of the four motors are intentionally designed to stimulate your partner, which helps you both have stronger, better orgasms."

      "content": "Try a vacuum erection device or penis ring to get and keep a firm erection. To help get a firm erection, explore using a vacuum erection device (also known as a penis pump ). Follow your product’s instructions—in most cases, you’ll place your penis inside a tube and operate a pump or switch to pull blood into the penis, forming an erection. Then, put on a penis ring to maintain the erection throughout sex. [2] X Research source Penis rings keep blood in the penis so it stays firmer for longer. To use, simply place the ring around the base of your penis (or around your penis and scrotum). Remove the ring after sex or after 30 minutes (otherwise it may cause tissue damage that makes future erections more difficult). [3] X Research source Toys and devices like these are easy, cheap ways to improve erectile dysfunction without visiting a doctor, using medication, or making large lifestyle changes."

      "title": "Communicate with your partner about your sexual interests and needs.",
      "content": "Communicate with your partner about your sexual interests and needs. Generally, involving your partner in your ED treatment yields better results. First, explain to your partner that your softer erections are not due to a lack of sexual interest in them; this reassures them that they are not “to blame.” [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Then, tell them about what you really enjoy during sex and what the two of you can do together to enhance your arousal. [5] X Research source Many men shy away from communicating about their turn-ons, which can cause or worsen soft erections. Doing so will not only lead to harder erections and more sexual pleasure, but also make you feel closer to and more relaxed around your partner."

      "title": "Focus less on penetrative sex and more on pleasurable sensations.",
      "content": "Focus less on penetrative sex and more on pleasurable sensations. The self-imposed pressure of penetrative sex can cause anxiety in many men. In older men, who typically need more stimulation to get and maintain a firm erection, there may be a tendency to rush into sex out of fear of losing the erection instead of taking things slow, which may only make the problem worse. Instead of prioritizing penetration, try some of the following: [6] X Research source Take your time with foreplay, either by yourself or with your partner, before trying penetrative sex. Consider role-playing or exploring erogenous zones like the ears, lips, neck, or inner thighs. This time can build up to a fuller, longer erection. Plan a sex session that doesn’t require an erection at all. Play with techniques like kissing, teasing, sucking, and other touching to stimulate yourself and your partner while relaxing and enjoying yourself. If possible, use these techniques to achieve an orgasm. After several sexual sessions that lead to orgasm without penetration, you’ll likely find that sexual encounters are fun again. This helps you re-engage with your partner instead of avoiding sex out of fear of failure, and this new attitude can help form stronger erections."

However, some men with ED or soft erections have perfectly normal levels of this hormone. Ask your doctor if your testosterone levels might be to blame, especially if you’re experiencing other symptoms like a decreased desire for sex (libido) or general fatigue.
