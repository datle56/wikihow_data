To send a gift, you must purchase TikTok coins, a virtual currency you can only use in the TikTok app. You can then use coins to buy gifts to send to your favorite creators, either during a TikTok LIVE or to a video (if they have video gifts enabled). When you send a gift, the coin value is converted into diamonds. Diamonds are another virtual TikTok currency specifically for creators that can be converted into money and transferred to a bank account. [1] X Research source One coin is equal to half a diamond, and each diamond is worth about half a cent."

      "content": "Determine how much a single TikTok coin costs. To do this, divide each coin pack purchase amount by the amount of coins in the pack. At the time of writing, there are 8 coin packs available for purchase, and the results from dividing the price by the coin amount are as follows: 0.0145, 0.0152, 0.0151, 0.0151, 0.0151, 0.0151, 0.0151, and 0.0152. Find the average of the results (add the results up and divide by 8). This will give you the average cost of a TikTok coin in your currency. One thing to note, however, is that TikTok focuses mostly on USD, so the exchange rate may affect the final amount the creator earns. Using the quotients calculated above, the average is 0.015. This means that, on average, a TikTok coin is worth one and a half US cents."

However, you can easily figure out how much you're actually paying for a gift by multiplying the average you calculated in Step 1 by the amount of coins a gift costs. Rose: A Rose gift is only worth 1 coin, which means it costs one and a half US cents to buy. Rosa: Not to be confused with the Rose, the Rosa gift costs 10 coins. This comes to a worth of $0.15 USD. Hat and Mustache: The popular Hat and Mustache gift costs 99 coins, which means it costs around $1.48 USD. TikTok Universe: The most expensive TikTok gift is the TikTok Universe. It costs 44,999 coins, which converts to just under $675 USD."

      "content": "Convert coins to diamonds to see how much a creator earns. If you're curious how much money your favorite creator is getting from your gift, you can figure this out with some simple math or by using a TikTok diamonds calculator . One TikTok coin is worth half a diamond. To determine how many diamonds a creator gets from your gift, take the total coin cost and divide it in half. For example, if you sent a gift worth 20 coins, the creator would get 10 diamonds. Once you calculate how many diamonds a TikToker got from your gift, multiply that by 0.005. This is because one diamond is worth half of a US cent. Using the example of a 20-coin gift being worth 10 diamonds, 10 x 0.005 is 0.05, or five US cents. You can also get an idea of what percentage TikTok is taking from gifts by comparing how much a 20-coin gift would cost (around $0.30 USD) to how much was paid to the creator ($0.05 USD)."

If you send the gift during a LIVE, it's an interactive experience with the TikToker and everyone else watching. However, TikTok creators don't get most of your donation when you send a gift. If this concerns you, check if your favorite creator has a Patreon or Ko-Fi where you can either subscribe monthly to support their work or send them a monetary tip to show your appreciation for their work. If you can't afford a TikTok gift or you're under 18 and trying to skirt around TikTok's age restriction for gifting, then TikTok gifts aren't worth it . Learn how to spend responsibly and identify the signs of a parasocial relationship (especially if you're only buying a creator gifts because you want them to notice you)."

Overall, you probably won't make a lot of money off of TikTok gifts unless you're one of the top TikTok creators with millions of followers and you go live often. Gifts are a fun way to connect with your audience, especially during LIVEs, as they're interactive. If you want to connect with your viewers while also understanding that you may not make much money off of TikTok gifts, then gifts might be worth it to you. However, if you rely on TikTok gifts for most of your income, then gifts probably aren't worth it, especially if you're asking for gifts repeatedly—many viewers could get put off by this and stop watching your LIVE. Try improving areas in your content that you feel are lacking, focusing on more reliable ways to get paid by TikTok, or consider cross-posting your content to multiple sites to increase your revenue streams."
