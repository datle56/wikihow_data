      "content": "Measure your banister to determine how much garland you need. Whether you want to drape your garland along the banister in a scalloped design or wrap it around the banister, measure the length of your banister and multiply that figure by 2. [1] X Research source For instance, if your banister is 7 ft (2.1 m) long, you need 14 ft (4.3 m) of garland. You can always piece together shorter pieces of garland with twist ties or craft wire to get the length you need."

      "title": "Attach the garland to the top of the banister with a zip tie.",
      "content": "Attach the garland to the top of the banister with a zip tie. Hold the garland at the top of your banister on the outside of the staircase. Then, wrap a zip tie around both the garland and the banister to secure it in place. Snip off the excess zip tie. [2] X Research source Zip ties, also called electrical ties, are made of plastic. They’re very strong and can hold garland in place for a long time. Choose dark green zip ties so they blend in with the garland. Having a family member or friend help you hang garland on your banister can make it easier. One person can hold the garland while the other person attaches it to the banister."

      "title": "Drape the garland along the banister for a traditional approach.",
      "content": "Drape the garland along the banister for a traditional approach. Drape the garland so it hangs down 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) from the banister to every third, fourth, or fifth spindle. Use zip ties to attach the garland to the banister and repeat the process to create a scalloped display along the entire banister. [3] X Research source Be sure to hang the garland at even intervals. For instance, if you have 20 spindles, you could attach the garland at every fourth one. If you have 15 spindles, you could attach the garland at every third spindle. Fluff the greenery to camouflage the zip ties completely. Or, use holiday ribbon to secure the garland to the banister."

      "title": "Wrap the garland along the banister for a festive option.",
      "content": "Wrap the garland along the banister for a festive option. Alternatively, you can wrap the garland between every second, third, or fourth spindle. Secure the garland to the banister with zip ties about every 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m). Wrap any extra garland around the post at the bottom of the stairs. [4] X Research source Consider attaching large holiday bows to the side of your banister to hide the zip ties. Bows with wire on the back are fairly easy to attach. Pile on holiday decorations and stockings for a truly dramatic garland."

      "content": "Place a garland hanger across the length of your door frame. These hangers are similar to tension rods and are the best options for hanging garland quickly and easily without putting any holes in your walls or door frame. Start by stretching the hanger across the length of your door frame. Slide the included pins into the holes at each end so that the frame is the right length. [5] X Research source A garland hanger has a loop on each end and a support feature in the middle that looks like a \"V\" with curls. Most garland hangers require minimal assembly. Hardware is usually included. You can buy a garland hanger at a craft, home improvement or home decorating store. They come in various sizes so shop for the one that best fits your door frame. You can fit the garland anywhere between the door frame that's comfortable for you since a door frame measures the same width from top to bottom."

Using both hands, position the garland hanger across the very top of the frame and straighten the center hinge of the hanger.

Secure each side of the garland over the loops at the ends of the hanger. [7] X Research source Take a step back and see how your garland looks. Fluff it as needed and attach accessories like twinkling lights, holiday bows, and ribbon with twist ties or cord."

Multiply this number by 2 to determine how much garland you need to wrap 1 entire column. Get twice as much garland if you're wrapping 2 columns. If necessary, buy a long length of garland and cut it to size or piece together smaller lengths of garland with wire. [8] X Research source"

With your cordless drill and a drill bit measuring 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm), drill a small hole no deeper than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) at the top of the back of your porch columns. Then, drill another hole at the bottom of the back of your porch columns. [9] X Research source Make the holes shallow so that your cup hook meets some resistance and holds firmly when screwed into the column. Drilling holes at the back of your porch columns make the cup hooks less visible."

Press and screw 1 cup hook into each hole you drilled in the porch columns. [10] X Research source Buy the largest cup hooks you can find at your local hardware store. Garland tends to be bulky, so the cup hooks you use must be big enough to hold it up."

You can use an all-purpose spray cleaner to remove dirt and grease buildup. If you don't have spray cleaner on hand, clean the tops of your cabinets with warm, soapy water. [13] X Research source Let the tops of your cabinets dry completely before sticking on the hooks. You might have to step on the counter or use a ladder to reach the tops of your cabinets."
