[2] X Research source If you have normal skin, your skin has the right balance of moisture, oil and durability. This is what you're trying to achieve with keeping it clean. If you have oily skin, your face might appear shiny, greasy or oil only a few hours after washing. If you have dry skin, it's often flaky, and can look dull. If you have sensitive skin, your skin is often tight or itchy and you experience allergic reactions when you come into contact with certain chemicals.

[4] X Expert Source Paul Friedman, MD Board Certified Dermatologist, American Board of Dermatology Expert Interview. 8 April 2020. Everyone's skin is different and needs different things. You may have to test out a few different face washes to find the one that works best for you. What you really want from a face wash is something that cleans away dirt and germs and excess oils, but doesn't strip your skin of its healthy oils. [5] X Research source Picking your cleanser is based on your skin type, how often you wear make-up, and how often you work out.

For instance, if your skin is oily, you'll want a cleanser that has a low pH level, which will be more effective in cleaning the oil. If you have sensitive skin, you won't want the cleansers that are full of chemicals. Avoid using ordinary soaps, which are too harsh for your face and can strip it of its natural oils. It's best to rinse your face with warm water or cool water. Hot water strips the healthy natural oils from your skin. You need to wash your face after exercising to get rid of any sweat and dirt and oils that might clog your pores. If you want to avoid chemicals from store-bought face wash, you can consider making your own ."

      "content": "Use toners. While not necessary, toners can be a great help to people with oily skin, acne, or badly plugged pores. Toners help remove excess oils, and dead skin after that remain after cleansing. This is an excellent way to add active ingredients like retinoids, antioxidants and exfoliants to your skin regimen. [7] X Research source Apply the toner after cleansing with a clean cotton facial pad to your forehead, nose and chin (the so-called \"t-zone\"). Move the pad in gentle circles, avoiding the eye area. Find the right toner for your skin type. Certain formulations can help exfoliate acne-prone skin; others contain anti-inflammatory properties for sensitive. Many dermatologists recommended not using an alcohol based toner because it's too drying even for oily skin."

Try to buy make-up that has \"noncomedogenic\" or \"non-acnegenic\" on the label if you can, as these are designed to help prevent acne and breakouts and won't clog your pores. Make sure that you aren't using old make-up. Skincare products, like food, have an expiration date. Using them after that date will do more harm than good. Try to use mineral based or water based makeup instead of choosing oil based ones as they make skin look greasy and dull."

A nice exfoliation scrub can increase the circulation in your face giving you a healthy, rosy glow.

Wash your hands well before dealing with pimples to avoid infection. [11] X Research source Avoid touching or trying to pop the pimple or you might irritate it. Popping a pimple can lead to scarring if you're not careful. Apply a cold, wet washcloth or teabag on the spot for three to five minutes throughout the day. This will help lessen the irritation. Use a spot treatment that contains 1 percent or 2 percent salicylic acid, which is often less irritating than benzoyl. Applying Visine on a cotton swab to the spot can reduce the redness."
