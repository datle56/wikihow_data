      "content": "Sow a jacaranda seed to grow a tree from scratch. Whether you purchased or harvested seeds from an established jacaranda, take a dry seed and soak it in water for 24 hours. This will help speed up the germination process. [1] X Research source Afterward, place the seed on a bed of potting soil in a container. Cover the seed with thin, well-draining soil and keep it moist. Wait 2 to 8 weeks for seeds to sprout. [2] X Research source Wait 8 months before transplanting the seedling outside or into a larger container. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Take a cutting from an established tree to propagate jacaranda. If you know a friend or relative with a jacaranda tree, ask for a cutting of their tree. Use a pair of sterilized, sharp shears and select a healthy brand with at least three buds. Cut a 15 in (38 cm) segment at an angle just above a leaf node to encourage growth. Place the jacaranda cutting in water so only the bottom is submerged. Roots take 2 to 3 weeks to appear when left in a warm area with indirect sunlight. [4] X Research source Spring is the ideal time of year for propagation."

      "content": "Use an established seedling or tree to get blooms sooner. If you live in a temperate or warm climate, get a jacaranda seedling from a local plant nursery or major retailer. [5] X Research source Jacaranda trees grow best in zone 10 on the hardiness scale. However, they can also survive in cooler areas—even regions with light frosts. [6] X Research source You may find jacaranda seedlings around the base of mature trees. If you can safely and legally dig up a seedling, you can transplant it into a container to grow your own.

      "title": "Select a spacious outdoor area with direct sunlight for 6 to 8 hours.",
      "content": "Select a spacious outdoor area with direct sunlight for 6 to 8 hours. Jacarandas can grow 25 to 50 ft (7.6 to 15.2 m) tall and 15 to 30 ft (4.6 to 9.1 m) wide. [8] X Research source Plant them in an area that receives direct sunlight for most of the year. [9] X Research source Plant the tree at least 15 ft (4.6 m) away from any nearby buildings, and avoid planting seedlings in the shade of other, larger trees. If you plant the jacaranda in a crowded space (e.g., under a patio or between narrow walls), it will not grow to its full size and may wither and become unhealthy."

      "title": "Use rich, well-draining soil to provide the tree with nutrients.",
      "content": "Use rich, well-draining soil to provide the tree with nutrients. Jacaranda roots will suffer if they're not well-drained and require fertile, rich soil to provide them with plenty of nutrients. [10] X Research source Opt for sandy soil with a slightly acidic pH level (6-7.5). [11] X Research source However, you can also use well-draining clay or loam soils . Look for limestone or perlite ingredients in your soil. [12] X Research source If you're growing your jacaranda directly into the ground, look for a patch of soil that isn't prone to having puddles or other plants."

If it feels dry, pour a cup of water into the soil. If the soil is already moist, wait 7 to 9 days before checking it again. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Water the tree once a week in the summer and once a month in the winter. Healthy jacaranda trees grow quickly but will wilt and possibly die without sufficient water. Use your finger to test the soil—if the top 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of soil feels dry, it's time to water it. Soak the soil until it is moist at a depth of 15 to 20 in (38 to 51 cm). Generally, you'll want to water the tree once a week in the spring, summer, and fall. [14] X Research source During the cooler winter months when the tree is dormant, water it once a month."

      "content": "Feed the jacaranda twice a year with a well-balanced fertilizer. Adding fertilizer to your tree is a great way to increase its resistance to injury from diseases and insects. [16] X Research source Jacarandas prefer organic fertilizers containing either composted manure, bone meal, or blood meal. Use a fertilizer with an N-P-K ratio of 10-20-10 to promote sturdy, deep root systems. For mature trees, use an N-P-K ratio of 12-10-10 for leaf development and energy production. [17] X Research source For young trees, use 1 lb (450 g) of fertilizer per 1 inch (2.5 cm) of trunk diameter twice a year during the spring or late summer. For mature trees, use 1.5 lb (680 g) per 1 inch (2.5 cm) of trunk diameter twice a year during early spring and mid-summer. N-P-K stands for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).

      "content": "Avoid pruning and allow the branches to grow on their own. The branches of a jacaranda tree grow vertically and expand outward in all directions. Let the branches grow on their own; if you trim shoots or prune branches, you may permanently stunt the tree's growth. Whenever a jacaranda branch is pruned, it sends out vertical shoots, and so continual pruning will lead to an unnaturally tall and misshapen tree. [19] X Research source A jacaranda will grow into a roughly umbrella-shaped tree if left undisturbed."

While a jacaranda’s brightly-colored flowers are beautiful, they have a pungent and foul smell when they start to decompose. They can also produce slime on your sidewalk and yards. So, to avoid a mess, rake up the flowers regularly. [20] X Research source Avoid planting a jacaranda tree in a position where its branches will arch over a swimming pool. When the flowers fall in autumn, they will blanket the surface of the pool and can clog the water filter. [21] X Research source"

Although jacaranda trees are strong, they're not immune to pests like aphids, spider mites, whiteflies, and sharpshooters. These pests can leave behind sticky residues and mold and drain vitality from the tree. Inspect the undersides of the leaves for tiny bugs or webbing. Spray insecticidal soap or horticultural oil on the leaves to treat them. [22] X Research source Use more potent chemicals or seek professional assistance if your tree is heavily infested.

To remedy this issue, reduce watering. Wait until the top 3 or 4 in (7.6 or 10.2 cm) are dry before watering again. Improve drainage by using raised soil beds or installing subsurface tile drains or vertical drains. [24] X Research source"

If the soil is soggy, add an absorbent layer, like compost, to help aerate the soil. Additionally, if you've recently transplanted your tree, it could be shocked.

[27] X Research source However, if a mature jacaranda still isn't blooming, this could result from insufficient light, improper pruning, or nutrient imbalance. Ensure the tree gets full sunlight for at least 6 hours daily and increase your fertilizer's phosphorus intake.

Jacarandas can only thrive in subtropical to tropical areas like Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil and select US locations like Hawaii, Southern California, Florida, and parts of Texas. They are mid-size trees known for their vibrant spring colors and purple or blue flowers. [30] X Research source Jacaranda bark is a thin, grayish-brown color that forms scales as it ages. These trees can live for as long as 200 years but average around 50. [31] X Research source Common varieties of jacarandas include Blue Jacaranda, Alba or White Christmas, Maroon, Bonsai Blue (shrub), Boxwood, Jacaranda Cuspidifolia (fern), and Yellow Jacaranda. [32] X Research source Jacarandas can grow from small shrubs to large trees. Blue Jacarandas are the most common variety; Boxwoods share the same appearance but are smaller. [33] X Research source Generally, Jacarandas take on a vibrant purple with a blue hue. However, Maroon or Purple varieties lack the blue hue. [34] X Research source"
