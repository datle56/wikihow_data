      "content": "Lateral raises One good exercise for building up your shoulder muscles and targeting your side delts is the side lateral raise . Start out with light weights (maybe 10 or 15 pounds (4.5 or 6.8 kg) to focus on good form) and move up to heavier ones as you gain strength. [1] X Research source To perform this exercise, hold some dumbbells in each of your hands and place your arms against the sides of your body. Then, raise the dumbbells up out to your sides so they are parallel with your shoulders. Recommended volume: 3 sets of 6–10 reps"

[2] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. By performing upright rows with a wide grip, you can work the muscles on the outer edges of your shoulders with heavier weights than lateral raises, building strength and widening your shoulders. [3] X Research source To perform upright rows, grasp a low cable bar with an overhand grip. Pull the bar straight up and back, leading with the shoulder, pulling the bar back. Arana offers rows with dumbbells as another option. [4] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. Stand next to a bench and place one knee on it. Then, place the hand on the same side of your body on the bench and grasp the dumbbell with your other hand. Pull the weight upwards lifting your elbow into the air behind you as you do so. Recommended volume: 3 sets of 6–10 reps (or to failure)"

As Arana explains, “There are 3 delt muscles: middle, front, and back.” [5] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. These are similar to side deltoid raises, but you perform them while bent over. [6] X Research source To do rear deltoid raises, bend over so that your back is parallel with the ground (keep it straight!). Get a dumbbell in each hand that is light to moderate (10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg)). The weight should not be so heavy you can’t lift it more than a few times. Then, begin raising the dumbbells out and away from your body until they are almost parallel with your back with slow and controlled motions. Initiate the movement from your delt without bringing your traps into it. Recommended volume: 3 sets of 8–10 reps on each side"

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand in front of you. [7] X Research source Starting with your hand close to your body, begin lifting the dumbbell upwards and in front of your body. When the dumbbell is about at shoulder height, begin to lower it slowly back to its starting position. Keep the delt activated while you lower it by moving slowly (not just letting your arm drop). Recommended volume: 3 of 8–10 reps on each side"

To do an overhead or military press , start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and holding a dumbbell in each of your hands. [8] X Research source To do the exercise, bend your elbows so the dumbbells are about shoulder height. Press the dumbbells straight upwards above your head and then bring them back down slowly. Alternatively, use a barbell with an overhand grip. As you push above your head, bring your hands back slightly so the bar is over your head (think about pushing “through” your head).

      "content": "Wide-grip pull-ups If you want to work with your own body weight, then doing pull-ups is a great option. Pull-ups will work your shoulder muscles along with your arm and back muscles at the same time. Using a wide grip will enhance the shoulder work as well. [9] X Research source Grasp a pull-up bar with your hands a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Then, pull your body weight upwards until your chin reaches the bar. Do as many pull-ups as you can. If you can’t do regular pull-ups yet, then you can try doing assisted pull-ups with a machine or resistance band. Most gyms have one of these machines. They use weights to counter your body weight and make the pull-up a little easier. Recommended volume: 5 sets of as many reps as possible Reader Poll: We asked 409 wikiHow readers and 57% of them agreed that pull-ups are the most challenging exercise to perform. [Take Poll] So you should take your time and work your way up to the full exercise!"

      "title": "Pike-style push-ups",
      "content": "Pike-style push-ups Push-ups also use your body weight to work your upper body and core muscles. However, you can target your shoulder muscles more intensely if you do pike-style push-ups . [10] X Research source To do pike-style push-ups, you will need a weight-lifting bench or a sturdy chair. Get into the push-up position in front of the bench or chair, then put your feet up on the chair. Use your hands to walk your upper body back towards the chair until you are in the pike position, which is similar to a headstand, but with your feet on the bench or chair. Your body should be bent at the waist. To do the exercise, lower your face down towards the ground by bending your arms. Then, when you are close to the ground, raise yourself back up by pushing through your shoulder muscles. Recommended volume: 3 sets of 8–10 reps Warning: Keep in mind that this type of exercise should be done with caution because losing your grip or positioning could result in serious harm to the neck and spine. When you feel close to failure, slowly lower yourself back down to the ground."

      "title": "Lat pulldown",
      "content": "Lat pulldown Using the lat pulldown machine primarily works your lats (the largest muscles in your back), but it also activates your rear deltoids (plus, having a broad back gives you that V-shaped torso which makes your shoulders appear wider). [11] X Research source Arana agrees: “Having a wider upper back will give you that illusion of having more broad shoulders. So working the lats would be the number one muscle to focus on. You can do that easily by doing lat pulldowns.” [12] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. To do the exercise, sit on the bench and adjust the knee pads so you can sit up comfortably with your knees bent at about 90 degrees. Grab the bar above you with a shoulder-width (or slightly wider) overhand grip. Engage your core and pull the bar down to about your clavicle, leaning back slightly as you pull. Recommended volume: 3–4 sets of 6–12 reps"

Along with sculpting your shoulder muscles, try to lose a few pounds to create a more V-shaped torso and make your shoulders look wider. [13] X Research source To lose weight at a healthy rate , you will need to reduce your overall caloric intake so that you are eating 500–750 fewer calories per day than you burn. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try keeping a log of everything you eat to determine how many calories you consume and cut down as needed. Only aim to lose 1–2 pounds (0.45–0.91 kg) of fat per week. More dramatic weight loss can impact your muscle growth and make it more difficult to grow your shoulders. Fill up on non-starchy vegetables, such as green beans, cauliflower, peppers, and zucchini to help reduce your overall caloric intake. You can also replace fatty proteins with lean proteins, such as skinless chicken, turkey burgers, tofu, and eggs."

If you’re already lean and working out regularly, aim to consume about 350–500 more calories a day than you burn.

[15] X Research source Daily protein: Aim for 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (about 0.7–0.8 grams per 1 pound (0.45 kg)) each day. Daily carbs: You’ll need about 4–7 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight (around 1.8–3.2 grams per1 pound (0.45 kg))) per day.

As you learn new exercises or start training your shoulders intensely for the first time, start with lighter weights (something you can do 12–15 reps before getting fatigued).

Aim for a 10% increase in any of these categories week to week to see progress. [17] X Research source For example, if you have mastered the overhead press at 50 pounds (23 kg), then try 55 pounds (25 kg) the following week. For bodyweight exercises where the weight is unchangeable, increase your intensity by adding extra reps. If you can reliably do 10 pike-style push-ups, aim for 11 to 12 next week. In general, you want the end of each set to be within 3 reps of failure.

[19] X Research source Stand up straight with your chest out and shoulders back and straight to make them look wider.

With some strength training , good posture, and confidence, you’ll give the illusion of broader shoulders (even if you’re not quite there yet). If your confidence is low, then work on building it up so that you can look and feel your best. Try writing yourself a letter from the perspective of someone who cares about you and wants to boost your confidence. What would that person say? Which of your strengths might they point out?
