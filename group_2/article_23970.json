      "content": "Make sure your floor is level. Using a level, check your floor for bumps or low spots. If you are replacing old flooring, then the floor will usually be level, but if you are installing a floor in a new house you need to be sure the surface is flat. Use a hammer and chisel to grind down high spots. Use a leveling compound to fill in any low spots. Ensure the subfloor is level and smooth. Oriented strand board or OSB is best for the underlayment or subfloor. Use a wood filler to fill in the gaps, holes, or cracks."

      "content": "Remove any molding or baseboards from the edges of the walls. Pry off the baseboards carefully and set them aside to reinstall after you've finished the floor. Place a putty knife of a thin metal blade in between the wall and the baseboard. Pry the baseboard off the wall by pulling towards you with the blade. Work your way down the board, repeating this motion every 3-6 inches. Use a pry bar to completely remove the baseboard if it still doesn't come off."

      "content": "Take off the doors. Remove the doors so that you have more room to work and don’t have to worry about them swinging at you. In some cases, you may have to trim the bottom of the doors or buy new doors if your new flooring is so high that the door catches. Remember this when you reinstall the doors."

      "content": "Cut underneath the doorjambs to make room for the new flooring. Using a jamb saw, which is available at most tool libraries or rental centers, trim away the bottom of the door jamb. The door jamb is the frame of the door, or its casing. Set your jamb saw to the height of the flooring and cut away so that you can slide your new flooring snugly underneath. You can also use a regular saw if you cannot get a jamb saw. Place a piece of laminate up against the doorjamb to see the proper height. Using a saw, cut into the door jamb using the laminate to guide you."

      "title": "Know the difference between laminate and traditional wood flooring.",
      "content": "Know the difference between laminate and traditional wood flooring. Laminate flooring consists of pre-cut wooden boards that snap into place with each other. You don't need nails or screws because each piece comes with an interlocking tongue and groove. You place one row of flooring down, then snap the next row into the first one until the room is covered. You always place laminate parallel to the longest side of the room. You need to figure out exactly how wide your final row of laminate will be, as it is rare that the rows will all fit perfectly right out of the box."

      "title": "Measure the dimensions of the room.",
      "content": "Measure the dimensions of the room. In order to buy the right amount of flooring, you need to know the square footage of the room. To calculate the square footage of a rectangular room, simply measure the width and length of the room in feet and multiply the two numbers. If you have an oddly shaped room, imagine it is made up of many smaller rectangular rooms. Measure each of these \"rooms\" separately and add together your answers to get total square footage. For example, an \"L\" shaped room would measure the vertical section and the horizontal sections, then add the answers together."

      "content": "Measure the distance from the longest wall to the other side of the room. It is easiest to install laminate flooring parallel to the longest wall in a room, and it usually looks best. Measure the width of the room from this wall to the other side and write this number down. Subtract 1 inch from the final result to account for the space between the floor and wall. For example, your room might be 22 feet (6.7 m) wide, or 268 inches wide. You need 267 inches of flooring to cover this width."
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide the width of the room by the width of your laminate.",
      "content": "Divide the width of the room by the width of your laminate. Take your longest width and divide it by the width of your planks or tiles. For example, if the width is 267 inches wide and the planks are 6 inches wide, you would get 44.5 planks. This number means that you need 44 and half of your six-inch planks to cover the entire width of a 268-inch floor."

      "title": "Use this measurement to plan the first and last row of flooring.",
      "content": "Use this measurement to plan the first and last row of flooring. This is often the hardest part about setting up your new floor. In the previous example, you needed 44.5 planks to cover your flooring. This means that there will be half a plank missing if you only laid down 44 pieces of tile/laminate, so you need to cut one row in half to make everything fit. To find the width of your last piece, multiply the decimal from your calculation by your plank width. For example, pretend you are using 8-inch wooden planks and you need 20.65 of them to cover the width of the floor. This means you need 20 normal rows, plus one row cut to 5.2 inches (.65 x 8 = 5.2)."

      "content": "Cut your first and last rows to fit your floor. You can use a table saw to do it yourself, but most hardware stores will cut wood or tiles for free if you ask. If you are cutting a new plank greater than 3.5 inches, consider splitting the difference and cutting matching first and last planks. Simply divide the number by two and cut two new sets of planks. For example, if you need your last plank to be 5.2 inches wide, you could instead have a first plank that is 2.6 inches and a last plank that has 2.6 inches, matching them perfectly. [2] X Research source Make sure that all of your planks are at least 2\" wide or bigger. Though less professional, you can also install all the floorboards and then measure the remaining space at the end. This, however, can lead to an unattractive “squeezed” look if your last row is much skinnier than the rest."

To do this, you need to start and finish with different lengths of laminate for every row, so the number of pieces needed will change each time."

      "content": "Lay out the underlayment. An underlayment protects your floor from damage and moisture, and is essential for laminate flooring. However, check your chosen laminate before buying an underlayment -- many of them come with pre-attached underlayment. Ask a specialist at your home-improvement store if you have any questions, but be sure to have an underlayment before continuing. A vapor barrier is one of the most important underlayments. It prevents moisture from getting under your floors and ruining them. They are essential if your subfloor is cement. Always install a vapor barrier if it does not come pre-attached."

For a better look and a sturdier floor, the horizontal joints of your laminate should be at least 6-12 inches apart. [5] X Research source If you have no remainder, or the remaining piece is too small, cut a piece of the laminate so that it is 2/3 the length of the piece next to it, then start with that.
