      "content": "You can’t get an itinerary for 100% free if you need one. Unless you qualify for a special, free visa (like you’re traveling for charity work, or you’re a diplomat), there’s going to be a fee for your application. These fees differ from country to country, but expect to spend anywhere from $15 to $300. [1] X Research source You’ll also typically need to spend money to prove that you have tickets or a reservation for tickets. Countries require proof of tickets because a return flight “proves” you won’t stay past your visa date’s expiration. On top of that, buying tickets can force you to have some skin in the game, which theoretically ensures that you aren’t just applying for a visa without intending to visit. For some countries, the reservation alone is enough to demonstrate that you’re serious. This is where a “dummy ticket” will work. If the requirements mention a “reservation,” this might be a good way to go."

      "content": "Read the visa requirements to see if you need to buy full tickets first. The visa requirements and application will be online. If the visa requirements indicate that you must purchase arrival and departure tickets (i.e. a reservation alone is not enough), then you’ll need to buy the tickets outright. Purchase both sets of tickets and submit the receipts and a copy of the tickets with your application. [2] X Research source If a visa application specifically indicates that you have to buy your tickets ahead of time, you will be denied a visa if you do not do this and there are no ways to do this for free."
    },
    {
      "title": "You can just reserve the tickets if the requirements say it is allowed.",
      "content": "You can just reserve the tickets if the requirements say it is allowed. If you only need a reservation, contact the airline you’d like to fly with and ask if they have a reservation process for travel itineraries. If they do, pay the small fee to reserve a ticket on future flights for both your departure and arrival and submit the confirmation paperwork with your application. [3] X Research source The cost of a reservation depends on where you’re going, who you’re flying with when you’re flying, and how far in advance you book. It can range anywhere from slightly cheaper than a normal ticket to thousands of dollars. Remember, this will only work if the visa application explicitly states that a reservation is acceptable."

      "title": "Buy refundable tickets so you can get your money back.",
      "content": "Buy refundable tickets so you can get your money back. Many airlines sell both refundable and non-refundable tickets. If you buy refundable tickets, you’ll be able to cancel them and get your money back if your visa application is denied. [4] X Research source These tickets may be slightly more expensive than their non-refundable alternatives, but you’ll be able to get your money back if you can’t use them, which you may not be able to do otherwise."

      "title": "Book with an airline that allows you to transfer tickets.",
      "content": "Book with an airline that allows you to transfer tickets. Many airlines will allow you to transfer tickets you weren’t able to use on the flight you booked. If you have somewhere else you were planning to go after the visa-required trip, go with an airline that allows transfers. That way, if your visa is denied you can simply move the tickets from the canceled trip to the future flight. [5] X Research source There’s rarely a fee for this, but there are often time restrictions. Book with an airline that gives you enough time to move the tickets for the second trip. For example, Spirit Airlines only gives you 60 days to use your transferred tickets, while Virgin Airlines will give you a full year."

      "title": "Get travel insurance for your tickets so you can get a refund if necessary.",
      "content": "Get travel insurance for your tickets so you can get a refund if necessary. If you have to book tickets for the application but aren’t sure you’re going to be approved, purchase travel insurance that will reimburse you for the flights if you have to cancel. It may cost a little bit upfront, but if you need to cancel your tickets you might get a lot of that cost back! [6] X Research source You don’t need to buy “full” travel insurance. Just contact a travel insurance agency and explain that you’re looking for insurance for the tickets alone."

      "content": "The ticket requirements are usually all you need, but it depends on the country. Find the destination country’s visa requirements online or contact their embassy directly to get them. Read through the requirements to determine what you need to do to get approved for a visa. Some countries are extremely strict, while others have very broad requirements. Familiarizing yourself with the steps might make the itinerary process easier. [7] X Research source Try not to visit any non-government site to research visa rules. There are a lot of shady websites that promise to get you visas for cheap, but they aren’t all 100% trustworthy. Make sure you’re following the steps for the correct visa since there are multiple options. For example, you usually need a student visa to study abroad, while conducting business requires a business visa. If you’re just going on vacation, you need a tourist visa. [8] X Research source"

Explain that you want help fulfilling the itinerary requirements for the visa. They’ll walk you through it and help you submit everything you need to be accepted. This can be the most efficient way to ensure that your visa is approved. It may cost up to $500 for a full itinerary, but you may be able to get help with the application for less if you want to book the tickets and plan the core of your trip on your own."

      "content": "An itinerary is confirmed if it’s verified by an airline. If you have a document from an airline that lists a confirmation code or demonstrates that you’ve actually reserved or booked your tickets, you have a confirmed travel itinerary. “Confirmed travel itinerary” isn’t a special designation or legal term—it simply means that your itinerary exists and someone at the airline can confirm it. [9] X Research source If a visa requirement mentions a “confirmed travel itinerary” in their requirements, they’re basically saying that they won’t take your word for it—you’ll need to provide proof that you have tickets."

There are a lot of travel itinerary companies online that will reserve tickets for you and provide the necessary booking information to fulfill the visa requirement. They often cost $15 to $20 depending on where you’re going. In some scenarios, this will work, but it’s risky. Not all of these companies are reputable, and your success depends on the destination company’s requirements. [10] X Research source This is a riskier option in most cases. You can go this route if you really want to save some money, but depending on where you’re going, it may not fulfill the visa requirement."

A dummy ticket will work if you actually paid to have a flight reserved for you and the visa application says you only need a reservation. [11] X Research source Technically, there isn’t any difference between a dummy ticket and a reservation—it’s just a question of whether you’re paying a company to do it or you do it through an airline directly. The reason people use dummy tickets instead of doing it themselves is that the dummy ticket companies can often get a better rate than you would going directly to the airline. However, you may have a higher risk of getting scammed if you use a disreputable dummy ticket company. It is illegal if you lie about the ticket or if you use a template to make it look like you have a real ticket.

If your application is denied, wait for them to “update” or change the flight information and cancel within 24 hours of that!

You’ll need to fill out the application with your personal details, submit a copy of your passport, and explain where you’ll be going. They may ask for payslips or bank account records to prove you can pay for the trip. They might request a physician’s letter to prove you have the necessary vaccines. [15] X Research source Outside of the application fee and the tickets, the rest of this process is typically free. It can be a little time-consuming to check this stuff off of your to-do list, but it tends to be fairly straightforward. Once you have everything you need, submit everything you need to the destination country’s online portal. [16] X Research source You can always contact that country’s embassy where you live if you have any questions or concerns.

For example, imagine you’re spending two weeks in Europe. Commutes would be shorter if you go from Paris to Berlin to Warsaw than they would be if you went from Paris to Warsaw to Berlin.
