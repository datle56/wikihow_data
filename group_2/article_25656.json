      "content": "Start with two to three necklaces of different lengths. For most occasions and styles, two or three necklaces should suffice to layer. You’ll get to show off more of your favorite pieces without creating a busy or distracting combination. The choice of lengths is up to you, but try to ensure at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of space between each necklace when wearing. [1] X Research source Here are some common lengths: [2] X Research source Choker (14 to 16 inches (36 to 41 cm)) – A common base/top layer. Princess (17 to 19 inches (43 to 48 cm)) – Hits at or below the collarbone. A common middle layer. Matinee (20 to 24 inches (51 to 61 cm)) – A common bottom layer. Opera (28 to 36 inches (71 to 91 cm)) – Adds dramatic length. Rope (over 36 inches (91 cm)) — Best for doubling over. If your necklaces aren’t different lengths, they can cover one another. They may also tangle or tarnish by rubbing against each other."

      "content": "Make sure each necklace complements the others in some way. Lay out all your necklace options (or viewing them on a jewelry tray or in a box). Note which ones have the same metal type, gemstone, color, thickness, setting, or texture. Matching at least one of these elements will guarantee a cohesive look, helping you set an easily identifiable theme. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your focal point on the top of your stack.",
      "content": "Place your focal point on the top of your stack. Your focal point should be the most dramatic, attention-grabbing piece in the stack. While you’d think the showstopper should be the centerpiece, most necklace layers feature a focal point on top or bottom. This helps draw the eye to the piece without it getting lost in the mix. [4] X Research source When putting your necklaces on, start with the top necklace, then the middle one, and finally the longest one. This will help you avoid tangling."

      "title": "Add a middle necklace that’s similar to the focal point but more subtle.",
      "content": "Add a middle necklace that’s similar to the focal point but more subtle. While you can mix and match lengths, metal colors, metal types, thicknesses, textures, and materials, you want to add complementary pieces for the sake of cohesion. Adorn your focal point with a piece that’s simple and subtle (usually in the middle) and another that’s interesting but not overwhelming. [5] X Research source It might take some trial and error to decide which pieces go best with your focal point necklace. Don’t be afraid to experiment—you never know what flattering combinations you’ll create."

      "title": "Add an accent necklace to the bottom of your stack.",
      "content": "Add an accent necklace to the bottom of your stack. Even if your top or middle necklace is the focal point of your stack, it never hurts to add visual interest at the lowest point. You can place the biggest gems on the bottom—long chains allow them to hang more neatly than short ones. [6] X Research source Alternatively, put your favorite pendant, spike, or charm necklace below the rest for a dazzling accent."

      "content": "Experiment with contrasts as you get more comfortable with layering. Mix the textures of your layering necklaces for a rich look that won’t blend into itself. Combine metal colors for varying levels of warmth or coolness. Make a statement with a vibrant beaded necklace or colorful solitaire, or keep your stack demure by simply contrasting lengths.

Use your personal judgment, considering your outfit and where you’re going to decide the appropriate amount of necklaces. While it’s fun to create a neck mess, balancing the number of necklaces will prevent your stack from becoming too busy to appreciate. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "When in doubt, buy a layered necklace set. Putting on layered necklaces (also known as layering necklaces or a necklace set) makes the whole process easier. Save time and potentially money by purchasing a layered necklace set you can wear daily or to many events. Try to buy a set in person if you can, so you can try it on and get a sense of how the necklaces hang on your collarbone and cleavage."

      "content": "Delicate Gold Chains A trio of delicate gold chains with subtle details creates a soft look. Start with a 16 inches (41 cm) thin chain—either plain or with a small gemstone. Put another princess-length thin gold chain in the middle. Finish with a final delicate chain—either matinee length or a longer princess length—that has a pendant or charm for an eye-catching detail. Image consultant Nejla Renee says layered gold necklaces and simple gold stud earrings create a casual chic look."

      "content": "Turning Up the Charm(s) A stack of charms adds personality and color to any ensemble. Create a natural visual pyramid by stacking three chains of the same color/metal, with the smallest charm on top and the largest charm at the bottom. Or, add several charms to your middle necklace and one more intricate one to the lowest piece in your layer. If you’re only layering two necklaces together, consider pairing a colorful beaded choker with a single, complementary charm on a chain hanging below it."

      "content": "A Variety of Thicknesses A thick chain between simple necklaces is perfect for streetwear statements. Select a chunky gold or silver chain and match the metal type when choosing the other necklaces. Offset it with simple designs—a loose herringbone choker on top, for example, with a square pendant necklace below. This look is an exception to typical layering, highlighting a bold piece in the middle of your stack because of its size and unique texture."

      "content": "Matching Gemstones A sparkly stack of gemstones adds elegance to any outfit. To start, layer two (17 to 19 inches (43 to 48 cm)) solitaire necklaces that feature matching stones in different shapes. For example, the top necklace could have a round diamond, while the central necklace has a square-cut (princess-cut) one. Complete the look with one or two longer solitaire necklaces with the same gems. [9] X Research source When stacking gemstones, look for solitaire necklaces with small, elegant stones. Differently sized gemstones may appear dissimilar or visually overwhelming."

      "content": "Mixed Metals A mix of two short silver chains and a long gold one provides playful contrast. While some necklace-layering purists shy away from mixing metals, there are no real rules. Layer a silver choker and princess-length necklace with a gold matinee-length piece for a dynamic look. Or, frame a dainty gold choker with two longer silver necklaces. Even when mixing metal types, try to color-match necklaces of the same metal to prevent clashing. For example, commit to all rose gold, white gold, or yellow gold pieces when you layer gold necklaces with silver ones."

      "content": "Pop of Color A colorful beaded necklace with a pendant chain is a perfect layer combination for summer. It’s also a good option if you don’t own many metal necklaces but still want to create a layered stack. Since this is a playful look, feel free to get creative when layering. Pair two contrasting sizes. Or, choose a necklace with a large, reflective pendant that will catch the colors of the beads. Most beaded necklaces are chokers, meaning they’ll be the base/top necklace in your layer."

      "content": "Lariat Look Lariat necklaces tend to be much longer than your average necklace (between 30 to 50 inches (76 to 127 cm)) making them ideal focal points for the bottom of a stack. A thin chain and simple initial pendant layered over a lariat necklace creates a classic look. Alternatively, you can swap the pendant in the middle for your favorite charm to add a pop of color."

Create chic contrast by varying the textures of the top and bottom chain—for example, starting with a paperclip chain , then a princess-length string of pearls, and finally placing a long figaro chain . The warmth of yellow gold pairs nicely with pearls, while white gold complements their coolness and lets their natural luster shine through.

[11] X Research source While neck messes often feature more than three necklaces, meaning is more important than quantity—you want to craft a stack that accurately represents your personal style. Layer five unique chains, finishing with your favorite pendant, for an easy maximalist neck mess. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a necklace detangler to undo knots and tangles. Necklace detanglers are special tools featuring small points or hooks. While proper storage and thoughtful layering can help you avoid tangles, sometimes they’re inevitable. A detangler will save you time, especially when dealing with fine chains. [13] X Research source Alternatively, jeweler Joseph R. Villarreal, G.G. (GIA) recommends using two small tweezers to undo jewelry knots. The tweezers will help you grab and tug the chain, making it easier and less frustrating to untangle your favorite necklaces."

Use a small, metal necklace spacer , also known as a necklace clasp, to hold the ends of your necklaces apart from one another, helping to prevent knotting. They’re often sold with enough clasps for three necklaces. You can also use a necklace extender to add length to one necklace, preventing shorter pieces from tangling with each other.

      "title": "Pair chains of similar thickness and clasp weight.",
      "content": "Pair chains of similar thickness and clasp weight. Thicker chains are heavier than thin ones, meaning they’ll likely weigh down lighter necklaces. When layering, try to find chains of similar thickness. If you’re intentionally including an extra-thick necklace, ensure there’s adequate distance between all of the layers. [15] X Research source"

Start by putting both necklaces on. Turn them so the clasps are in front of you and unclasp them. Reconnect the first necklace’s clasp to the second necklace’s link, and repeat. Then, twist the clasps back behind your neck. [16] X Research source"
