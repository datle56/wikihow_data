[1] X Research source You will be using ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances. If you have a very small head, you might want to cut a smaller circle. If you have a bigger head, you'll need to cut a bigger circle."

[2] X Research source If you want a taller hat, make the rectangles 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide instead.

[3] X Research source If you want a wider brim, cut the arches 4½ inches (11.43 centimeters) wide instead.
