      "content": "Practice levitating your card. Taking care to make sure you don't get tangled in your invisible line, shuffle a deck of cards until you are ready to make your card float. Then, raising your hand with your fingers splayed, catch your invisible thread between your pointer and middle fingers. Hold your deck of cards loosely as you do this, and as you raise your hand, the card will be raised, as though it is floating, on your invisible thread. [14] X Research source Alternately, you can shuffle until you are ready, take your trick card in hand, and launch it in a gesture similar to that of throwing a Frisbee. This will cause your card to spin rapidly and hang in the air. Try not to use excessive force! If your card moves too much, your audience might realize the pivot point from which it is hanging.
