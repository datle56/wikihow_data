      "content": "Use a sanding tool on the seam. Insert 220-grit sandpaper into a handheld sanding tool and gently apply the tool to all of the seams on your jean jacket. Use long swipes in order to gently distress the denim and avoid damaging the fabric. [1] X Research source It's okay to hold the sandpaper in your hand if you don't have a sanding tool. Sanding tools can be bought at a home improvement store. Do not press down too hard with the sanding tool or you may pop the topstitching."

      "title": "Brush your sanding tool all over the jacket.",
      "content": "Brush your sanding tool all over the jacket. Once you've gone over the seams, make long, sweeping motions with the sandpaper all over your jacket. Go over the sides and back of your jacket to create light marks. If you want more apparent marks, push down longer and harder with the sandpaper. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Go over the sleeves with the sandpaper.",
      "content": "Go over the sleeves with the sandpaper. Use a long piece of cardboard or a sleeve board to keep the sleeves stiff as you apply sandpaper to them. Gently use the sandpaper over the length of the sleeves. Focus on the elbows because this is an area that becomes naturally distressed over time. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Put a thick piece of cardboard inside of the jacket's arm. Make sure the cardboard is underneath the elbow of the jacket. This will prevent you from making a hole all the way through the jacket. You will use this piece of cardboard for other areas of the jacket that you distress as well."

      "content": "Go over the marked spots with an X-ACTO knife and sandpaper. Once the cardboard is in place, use your X-ACTO knife to make cuts in the fabric. You can make the cuts as small or as large as you'd like, depending on how distressed you want the jacket to appear. After you've made the cuts, roughen them up by rubbing heavy-duty sandpaper over them. Repeat this process on the other arm. The cuts should go through only one side of the fabric, not both sides of the jacket's arm."

Use the X-ACTO knife to make cuts around this area. Alternate between deep and shallow cuts to create variety. Be careful to only make cuts through the pocket and not through the back of the jacket. Go over the cuts with the sandpaper. Then, repeat if there is a pocket on the other side of the jacket."
