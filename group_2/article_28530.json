      "content": "Recognize that numbing yourself comes at a cost. Studies show that repressing negative emotions can deplete your psychological resources, making it more difficult for you to handle stress and make good decisions. This means that numbing yourself from emotional pain might hurt your resilience or even your ability to remember events. Only numb yourself if it is truly necessary for you to get through your daily life. An effective alternative to numbing yourself is to work through your emotional pain by reframing it and focusing on more positive emotions. For example, you might want to numb yourself to an embarrassing incident that happened to you at work. However, maybe you can try to see that the incident is not humiliating, but rather quite funny. This is commonly known as cognitive reappraisal and, while not the same as emotional numbness, can produce a similar desired effect.

      "content": "Take control over situations you dislike. Sometimes you have to be around people you dislike or perform tasks you hate. If you cannot avoid the things that cause you emotional pain, find ways to take control over them. Do not view yourself as a helpless victim: find as much agency as you can in the situation. Simply reminding yourself that you always have a choice can help you get through emotional times relatively unscathed. [6] X Research source For example: If you get stressed out studying for tests the night before the exam, try studying for the exam two nights before instead. Then you can relax the night before the exam. If you hate going to parties because there are too many people, ask one or two close friends to attend it with you. Seek them out if you need to get away from the crowd and have a more private conversation."

By distracting yourself, you will be able to process your emotions later, when you are more likely to be calm and reasonable. But for now, don't worry about processing your emotional state: simply change your mood by changing your activity.

In other words: by pretending to feel a certain way, you can actually begin feeling that way for real. If you want to be emotionally numb, act emotionally numb. This might be difficult during times of stress, but with some practice it will soon become natural.

Even when you are not sad or upset, being mindful of what you are feeling and why will help you understand your instinctive emotional responses to everyday life. Eventually, your mindfulness will allow you to control your emotional responses more effectively. When you perform your \"mental check-in,\" ask yourself the following questions: What am I feeling in this moment? Am I feeling a single, overwhelming emotion, or a combination of emotions? Simply giving your emotions a label can help you view them more objectively. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Why am I feeling this way? Are my emotions due to internal factors (such as my own fears) or external factors (such as when somebody yells at me)? Do I like the way I am feeling now? Perhaps you are feeling joyful or grateful about life and want to foster these emotions. But perhaps you are feeling anxious or nervous and do not want to experience these emotions in the future. What can I do to control my feelings in the future? Ask yourself if you can encourage your positive emotions while discouraging or even dismissing your negative ones. How can you structure your life so that you are the one controlling your emotions--not letting your emotions control you?"
