This will make brushing take longer, but will ensure a thorough brushing."

If the matts are too big to comb through, cut them out with the scissors. Don't yank and pull to get the matts out. This will hurt your dog make grooming a negative experience for it. If your dog seems to be prone to matted fur, consider taking them to a groomer. They may recommend an all-over haircut to make the matting less likely."

[11] X Research source To properly trim the nails: [12] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Choose between guillotine- and scissor-type trimmers. Although they’re both effective, guillotine trimmers may be easier for you to use. Hold only one nail at a time. Position the trimmer so you cut the nail at an angle that matches the nail’s natural curve. Trim to just above the quick, the pink vein running through the nail. The quick is easier to see in light-colored nails. If your dog has dark nails and you cannot see the quick, start by clipping the nail little by little. As you get closer to the quick, you will notice the white spot at the center of the nail begin to darken. This can be a good cue to stop clipping. It is a good idea to have styptic powder on hand so that if you do clip the quick on accident, you can quickly stop the bleeding. Styptic powder should be available at your local pet store. After trimming all the nails, file them with an emery board (available at your local pharmacy) to smooth out the rough edges."
