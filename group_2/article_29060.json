      "title": "Click the gear button in the top-right corner.",
      "content": "Click the gear button in the top-right corner. This will open your level settings, which allows you to pick your level's speed, colors, music, and more. Once you finish this menu, click OK . The options are as follows: Speed: The default is normal speed, denoted by the blue arrow. You can change this to a slower speed or one of three faster speeds. You can change this at any time during the level creation process. Colors: You can set the colors for the background (BG), ground (G), and middle ground (MG), as well as accent colors (G2 and MG2). Line is the ground's outline. You can change your colors at any time. BG, G, and MG: This sets the background, ground, and middle ground art. You can change this at any time during the level creation process. Mode: There are eight modes. These modes change how the player plays the level. The game modes are as follows: Cube: The default game mode where the user clicks to jump. Ship: The user can fly by holding down their mouse button and descend by letting go. Ball: The user rolls forward and clicking changes the gravity and switches the player from rolling on the floor to the ceiling. UFO: The player can also fly, but clicking boosts you upwards. Wave: The player moves diagonally upwards by clicking and diagonally downwards when not clicking. (Disabled in Platformer.) Robot: When clicking the mouse, the player will jump, but the speed of the click determines jump height. Spider: Similar to Ball mode, but gravity switches immediately upon clicking. (Disabled in Platformer). Swing: The user flies, but each click changes the player's gravity. (Disabled in Platformer). Gamemode: You can select Normal or Platformer. Normal is the default Geometry Dash playstyle, where the camera always scrolls to the side, and you click to jump (or move in some way, depending on the mode). Platformer is a new mode that allows players to move freely left and right. Song: Select a song for your level. You can pick one of the Geometry Dash songs, or click Custom to select a unique song. You can select a song from Geometry Dash's music library or from Newgrounds by clicking their respective buttons. Options: Allows you to select other options for your level. Feel free to change these options for your level, but don't change anything in the Legacy Options section, as these options fix older bugs within the game. Font: You can select a font to use for all the text in the level. This is one of the few options that cannot be changed further into the level."
