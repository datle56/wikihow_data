      "content": "Review your current schedule to see how you spend your time. Before you create a study timetable that’s perfectly tailored for your academic goals, get a sense for how you’re running your life right now. For example, do you spend a ton of time socializing or unwinding with video games? While that’s perfectly fine, you might notice that you can repurpose some hours to master your class or ace a test. [1] X Research source Remember—any sacrifices you make are temporary. You'll be able to go back to your everyday routines after your big exam or assignment. Sometimes, you’ll have to fit your studying around some things that you do on a regular basis, like extracurriculars, chores, or exercise. [2] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. It’s totally fine if you take off some days to enjoy yourself. Just be sure to make up the difference later!"

If you accidentally tossed it, ask your teacher for another one. If your teacher uses an online platform, like Blackboard, scroll through it to familiarize yourself with the pace and general challenge level of your class. [3] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. For example, maybe your professor assigns a lot of small and super achievable assignments, like weekly reflection papers, and only gives one mid-term. On the other hand, your professor might be more tough and assign bi-monthly exams. Or, they may expect you to turn in multiple drafts of any essay. See which tasks are more time-consuming. For instance, maybe you’re a whiz at pre-lab assignments, but you need to dedicate a couple hours each day to quantum mechanics."

      "content": "Decide which times are optimal for studying. Consider when your brain is alert and when you’re most energized. When it comes to reviewing your materials, are you a morning or a night person? After the sun rises and you chow down on a bowl of oatmeal, are you ready and raring to go? Or, do you like to eat dinner, wind down, and meticulously look over your notes? When you find out your “peak study hours,” you’ll be able to create the best schedule for yourself. [4] X Research source Look for times when you won't have any distractions—for instance, you might be completely free to study from 7 A.M. to 10 A.M. or 5 P.M. to 8 P.M."

      "content": "Create your timetable grid. Are you a big picture type of person? If so, you might want to make a study timetable that maps out a whole month. However, you may prefer to “chunk” your material and create a study timetable that outlines your week. If you are really hands-on, you might like to use a ruler, a pen, and highlighters to draw out your timetable on a piece of paper. However, you can also speed up the process by making a digital timetable on a spreadsheet or with an app. [5] X Research source Try out spreadsheet programs, like Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers . Or, experiment with some of the templates that your word processor—like MS Word —offers. Some apps specialize in study timetables—for instance “My Study Life” helps you record and track all of your exams and assignments. If you're frequently online or on your phone, a physical paper timetable might be the best option for you. You’ll be able to refer to it without getting distracted by your tech. You can also combine paper and digital formats: use your computer to print out a grid that you’ve already added days and times to, then print out as many as you like and fill them out by hand."

      "content": "Draw the grid for your timetable. A traditional timetable tracks all the days you’ll spend studying as well as the time you’ll allot for each task. Once you create a grid with plenty of squares (for example, a 7x8 grid), write the days of the week at the top. Once those squares are filled in, the rest can be used to block out times when you’ll study for tests, assignments, or presentations. [6] X Research source If you’re making a timetable by hand on paper, use regular notebook paper or blank paper and draw your lines with a ruler for a clean look. The biggest downside to the paper-and-pencil method is that it can be pretty labor intensive if you need to make tweaks on multiple pages. Your safest bet is to use a digital program, like Google Sheets . After all, you might end up adding more blocks on your timetable if your teacher assigns new material, like quizzes or extra credit assignments. However, lots of people prefer to study and organize their time on paper, so you should do whatever motivates you best. Reader Poll: We asked 942 wikiHow readers and 68% of them agreed that their preferred way to schedule their study time is by making paper revision timetables . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Choose a timetable template that you'll use every week. If you’d like to streamline your process, design or download a timetable that you’ll print out and fill in every week. Create a batch of these timetables in one go based on the information you receive from your syllabus and your course management system, like Blackboard. All this prep will save you a lot of time in the long run. [7] X Research source Take into account big assignments or final exams and update your study schedule by adding blocks of times you'll use to study for them. Factor in extracurriculars that you identified earlier, like holidays or sports. Fill in squares to represent blocks of time in which you won’t be studying."

      "content": "Block your study times. Aim for blocks of study time that are fairly long, such as 2–4 continuous hours. This will help you get into the groove of studying and make sure you're more productive with your time. Time-blocking is a tried and true tactic to eliminate distractions so you can dedicate all your attention to your coursework. [8] X Research source Have a day where you're super busy? That's totally fine—just look for a block of time that's available. Even 45 minutes can keep you ahead of the game when it comes to studying. If you have some classes that are really challenging for you, it's a good call to set aside more time to study for them. For example, if French is a breeze, squirrel away 1 hour for it. However, if you have to rack your brain over Statistics, devote a whole 4 hours to review the ins and outs of it. [9] X Research source Bear in mind that you don't have to force yourself to stay on task for 4 continuous hours without a single break—we'll cover that in the next step."

If you build breaks into your study schedule, you're more likely to overcome boredom and to return to your work feeling refreshed and energized. [10] X Research source Many experts recommend that you work for 45 minutes every hour, and then take a break for 15 minutes. Everyone is different, though, so experiment to find what works best for you. If you think you thrive with regular breaks, or if you tend to get a little restless, try the \"Pomodoro Method\": during the block of time that you're studying, commit to 25 minute stretches of concentrated work, then take 5 minute breaks. [11] X Research source For an extra boost to your health, build in activity breaks—for example, go for a 15-minute walk or make use of a 5-minute break by doing a set of push ups, sit ups, or body weight deadlifts."

Schedule blocks of time that represent when you'll study for all of your classes. Also remember to fill out squares on your grid to note which assignments and presentations you'll be responsible for. For instance, instead of just writing \"English,\" jot down: \"Create outline for essay on post-modernism.\" You'll have a clear picture of what you need to prioritize. [12] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. Things will change over time, of course, and something you planned 2 months ago may not apply anymore. If that's the case, use a pen to draw an \"X\" through any assignments or tests you no longer have to take. Homework's also great to add to your timetable. For example, if you always have 20 math problems to do each week, record that in your timetable. Scribble in new updates that come up, too. For example, if two teachers are offering extra credit opportunities, factor that into your study timetable."

Working on different subjects during a single session will keep you from getting completely burned out by intensely focusing on one subject and ending up with next to no energy to do anything else.

You'll see it as a fun and almost therapeutic activity that lets you get a little artistic. You might want to use colored pencils if it’s on paper. Or you could highlight things on the computer and print in color. If you’re using an online-only app, you'll usually have to stick with the range of colors it provides (i.e., blue, green, orange, and pink). Consider an online program like Canva . You'll have tons of templates to choose from. You can even add fun digital stickers, like bubbling beakers to represent your Chemistry class.

When you ace all your tests and earn an awesome grade, so many doors will open up for you. [14] X Research source If an emergency comes up, take care of what you need to. Just be sure to find extra blocks of time later in the week to make up the difference. All that dedication gives you a great chance to treat yourself later. Grab some ice cream, phone some friends, or play some video games when you finish. After you're done with all your classes, you can even throw a little party."

Just focus on finishing up all your most important tasks while also factoring in time for some rest and relaxation. Ultimately, a timetable's a little system to help you perform better in your classes. Base your time on it, but don’t worry about not following it to the tee. [15] X Research source If you want to, meditate, move around, or chat with a friend right before you jump into all your coursework. In fact, research suggests it's smart to unwind before all the hard work you'll do. [16] X Research source"

You already put effort into making the timetable—there’s no reason to scrap it when a few simple revisions could make it work well for you. While it's best to stick to your timetable, it's also important to update it if any there are any new developments. If you have to make a lot of adjustments, a digital timetable might your best bet. If you prefer a physical copy, make sure your timetable has lots of empty squares so you can fill in new information. If you want a change, such as switching from a pen-and-paper timetable to one on an app, that's totally fine—it's important to do what feels sustainable for you."
