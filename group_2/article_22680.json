You can find your \"Most Compatible\" partners in the \"Standouts\" section. [3] X Research source If you don't provide enough information to Hinge, you could get incorrect results and match with someone that isn't your type. The more you use Hinge, the better. The algorithm can then gather more information from your actions (the profiles you like and skip) and give you better matches! The dealbreaker option allows you to rule out profiles that might be a good match for you, but have habits that you don't like. For example, if your dealbreaker is smoking, you won't get any matches that have their \"Smoking\" set to anything other than \"None.\""
