Give whatever you're doing all of your attention, and the guy will see that you’re having an amazing time and not thinking of him at all (even if you are)! [1] X Research source Don’t let him see you looking around the room for him or trying to put on an act for him. Have a good time so he really doesn't think he's on your mind at all. That will drive him crazy."

Pick a cute, comfortable outfit that makes you feel confident, and dedicate time to styling your hair and putting on makeup (if you like wearing it). Looking like your best self will show him everything he’s missing and help with your self-esteem. [2] X Research source Aim to look like your best self, not like a celebrity or a supermodel."

      "content": "Be unavailable and limit communication to make him sweat a little. Wait to answer his calls or respond to his texts instead of immediately responding when he hits you up. When you call him back a couple of hours later (and you definitely should call him back if you're interested) be vague about what you're up to so he wonders what you were doing without him. [3] X Research source Say you were out with a friend or you were just busy instead of giving him all the details. In the same vein, if he calls you to ask if you want to do something, decline his offer every once in a while and just say that you have other plans (even if you don't). If he texts you a lot, don't get back to him right away. Give it at least a day or two to make him see that you have better things to do than to get back to him ASAP (even if you don't!). If he's passing you in the halls and says hi, you can say hi back, but don't slow down and talk to him; you've got places to go!"

Post pictures with guys you know, mention an amazing party or museum you went to recently, or just show the world how much you love your friends. You don't have to go overboard and post a photoshoot of you and ten hot guys playing a game of beach volleyball—just post your exciting moments and he may get jealous of all the fun you're having without him. [4] X Research source Don't post too often, though, or he may think the opposite—that you have no life. Just posting something two or three times a week should do the trick."

      "content": "Keep your conversations with him brief. Talk to him for a few minutes and then tell him that you have to go–whether you're going to class, meeting up with friends, or doing absolutely nothing. If he thinks he can talk to you for hours until he has to go, then he may feel like he has all the power in the relationship. Even if you do like him, force yourself to break away. You can even text other friends while you're together. If he feels like you aren’t paying attention to him, he may try harder to get your focus back on him. Be careful with this one, though, as doing so too frequently can make him feel like you don’t care about him.

If you want to make him jealous, start doing these things yourself to show him that you don’t need him—change the lightbulbs, take out the garbage, etc. Most guys love feeling like providers, so if he sees you handling things on your own, he’ll likely double down to really show that he cares."

Dedicating time to your friends has been shown to boost happiness and reduce stress.

If you don't stay busy, you may spend all of your time obsessing over the guy. If you really can't stop thinking about the guy and have nothing to do, make a point of packing your schedule to keep busy. If he can see you being busy and doing things that matter to you (other than him), then great. He'll be even more interested."

Mark burned me their newest CD and I just can't stop listening to it.\" The subtle mention of a guy you know can make him much more jealous than if you raved on and on about all of the guys you know. [7] X Research source Talk to him about how funny a male colleague or friend is. Casually mention your male friend or colleague and tsay something like “This guy at work told me the funniest joke today!” Send him pictures of you and your guy friends and say something like, “My friend John is coming into town this weekend. I’m so excited to see him!” He may realize he isn’t the only guy you’re close to and try harder to keep you close. Most guys have a hard time even hearing about your interest in other guys, especially celebrities, so talk about how hot your favorite celebrity is or how you’d go for him if you two weren’t already dating. Don't name-drop too often, though. Mentioning another guy's name on occasion will do the trick."

[8] X Research source If you flirt with too many guys in a short period of time, however, he might catch on, especially if you're not normally that much of a flirt. Don't make it too obvious, because he might think you're not interested in him and plan to pursue someone else. There's a difference between casually flirting and leading a guy on.
