      "content": "Use a measuring tape to measure your dog's chest and length. Before you start knitting, take your pooch’s measurements so you know how big their sweater should be. To measure your dog’s chest, wrap your measuring tape around the widest part of your dog's rib cage. To measure your dog's length, hold the end of the measuring tape at the neck near the collar and pull it to the base of the tail. Write down both measurements.

      "content": "Buy enough yarn for your sweater. Look for super chunky or super bulky yarn in a color that you like. To make a small, medium, or large sweater, get 1 to 2 skeins that are about 6 ounces (170 g) each. If your dog is an extra large breed (like a Great Dane or Cane Corso), buy 2 to 3 skeins just in case. If you want to knit a multicolored sweater, purchase 2 or 3 different colored skeins that you think your dog will like cute in. Then, alternate these colors as you knit each row."

The material of your needle doesn’t matter; pick whatever needles feel the most comfortable to you (bamboo, metal, plastic, wooden). Use a large-eyed blunt needle for assembling the back and underpiece of your dog’s sweater. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Knit a swatch to gauge your sweater size. Before you begin making the real piece your doggo will wear, create a small knit sample (called a swatch). Use this swatch to measure the sweater’s knit gauge (gauge refers to the number of stitches per inch) and confirm it’s the right size. Cast yarn on 8 stitches and knit 16 rows to make a square swatch. Use a ruler to measure this swatch. The gauge of your sweater should be about 4 inches (10 cm). Adjust the size of your needles if necessary. If your gauge is too big, use needles that are smaller. If your gauge is too small, use larger needles. Discard your gauge once you've finished measuring it."
