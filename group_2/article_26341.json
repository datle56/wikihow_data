      "title": "Start with flawless skin.",
      "content": "Start with flawless skin. Barbie has pretty flawless skin so make sure you take care of yours, using the following tips: Wash your face twice a day and remember to moisturize once in the morning and once at night with a product suited to your skin type. Wear sunscreen outdoors (even when it's not hot) to prevent dark spots, freckles and sunburn. Using a medicated spot cream to get rid of any pimples and avoid touching your face without washing your hands first. Always take your make up off before bed."

      "title": "Apply foundation.",
      "content": "Apply foundation. Create a perfect canvas for the rest of your make up by applying your foundation. Spray an airbrush spray foundation (that perfectly matches your skin tone) onto the back of your hand, then use a stippling brush to dab it onto your face, creating an even flawless finish. Use your favorite, high-coverage concealer to cover up any dark circles around your eyes or any other imperfections. Use a powder puff to dab some loose powder onto your face -- this sets your foundation without smudging the flawless finish you've already created."

      "title": "Contour your nose.",
      "content": "Contour your nose. Barbie has a tiny nose, so you'll need to make your own nose appear smaller using contouring. Take a matte (non-shimmering), brown eye shadow and a thin make up brush and start contouring along the sides of your nose, in a straight line from the inside edge of your eyebrows down. Take a fan brush and use it to lightly feather out the lines, to blend them in and make them appear more natural."

    {
      "title": "Apply eye shadow.",
      "content": "Apply eye shadow. The next step is the eyes. First take a light baby blue eye shadow and apply it all over your lids. Next, take a matte white eye shadow and apply it to the inner corners of your eyes. This will help to open up your eyes. Also apply the white powder to your brow bone, as highlighter. Now take a bright pink eye shadow and apply it above the crease of your eyelid, so it makes a semi-circular line from one edge of your eyelid to the other. Lastly, take a dark blue color and use it to line the crease of your eyelid, so it forms a distinct line between the light blue and pink shadows. Then use this same dark blue color to line your upper and lower lashes, creating a cartoon look."

      "title": "Apply eyeliner and false lashes.",
      "content": "Apply eyeliner and false lashes. Take a white eyeliner and use it on your waterline (the inside of your lower eyelash). This will make the whites of your eyes appear larger and wider. Take your false eyelashes (whichever style you think is most Barbie-ish) and measure them against your natural eyelashes. Cut them to length (from the inside) if necessary. Apply a line of the eyelash glue and wait a minute or two for it to become tacky. Then carefully apply the false eyelashes to your real lashes. For a real Barbie effect, apply half-length strips of false lashes to your lower lash line, running from the outside corner to the center of your eye."

      "title": "Apply pink blush and lip color.",
      "content": "Apply pink blush and lip color. Take a rosy pink powder blush and use a brush to apply it to the apples of your cheeks and along your cheek bones. Take a shimmering pink lipstick and apply it to your lips. Use a lip brush to define the edges of your lips and achieve a more precise shape. To create a doll-like effect, take a concealer and apply it around the outside of your lips to create a sharply defined effect. Use a brush to blend the concealer in well and apply some loose powder on top. Take a pink lip gloss and apply it on top of the lipstick to add some shine. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Go blonde.",
      "content": "Go blonde. Everyone knows that Barbie has blonde hair, so if you really want to imitate Barbie's look you'll have to follow suit! If you really want to commit to the Barbie look, you'll probably need to bleach your hair to get that white-blonde effect. If you've never done this before, you should book an appointment with a professional hair stylist -- you don't want to ruin your hair! If you're not ready to commit to all-over bleach, you can lighten the color of your hair less dramatically using a blonde hair dye or by getting highlights. Again see a professional if you don't feel comfortable doing this yourself. But if you're simply trying to achieve the Barbie look for a costume party or fancy dress, a blond wig is your best option. This will give you perfect Barbie-blonde hair without the need for permanent color or dye. Try also adding a pop of color to the wig, like some Barbie dolls have.

      "title": "Style your hair.",
      "content": "Style your hair. Barbie's hair is always perfect, without a strand out of place. If you decided to buy a blonde wig, your job is pretty much done, but styling your natural hair to look like Barbie requires a little more effort. Keep your hair in good condition by washing it frequently with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. This is important, as blonde hair color can be very drying. Keep your hair as long as possible, but make sure it's in good condition by getting it trimmed regularly. Barbie sometimes has bangs, so consider getting those cut in too. If you decide to wear your hair down, use a flat iron to make large, loose waves and use some hairspray to give your hair lots of volume. Alternatively, you can just wear your hair straight or tie it up in a high ponytail -- it depends on which Barbie look you're trying to achieve."

      "title": "Get tan.",
      "content": "Get tan. Barbie has sun-kissed skin, something you can achieve by tanning your skin naturally or using self-tanner from a bottle. If you can tan naturally, you're lucky. However, you still need to take good care of your skin. Always wear sun-tan lotion while sunbathing to prevent sunburn and skin damage -- otherwise you will pay the price in later life. If you need to apply self-tanner, use one that builds up gradually and compliments your natural skin tone. Make sure to exfoliate well before applying -- this removes any rough or flaky skin and prevent the self-tanner from looking patchy. Regardless of whether your tan is natural or fake, you should moisturize your skin regularly with a hydrating lotion to keep your skin nice and soft."

      "title": "Paint your nails.",
      "content": "Paint your nails. Barbie girls should always have perfectly manicured nails -- on fingers and toes. You can paint your nails yourself or go to a salon for a more professional finish. Obviously pink is the natural choice for Barbie nail color, but you could branch out a little by going for something like purple or orange -- as long as it's something bright and cheery. No dark colors, like red, purple or black (unless you wanna be a Goth Barbie!) Another good option is a French manicure -- light pink or peach base with a white tip. This is very classic and sophisticated and works well with the Barbie look. If you apply the nail polish yourself, try to be as neat as possible. Apply a single stroke of polish down the center of your nail, then do a second and third stroke on either side. Clean up any mistakes with a cotton bud dipped in nail polish remover. If you decide to get your nails done professionally, think about getting a gel manicure. These are more expensive than a regular manicure, but the polish will last for up to three weeks and won't chip or peel."

      "content": "Wear pink. [3] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 21 October 2021. If you want people to recognize your Barbie look, you've got to wear pink -- it's the classic Barbie color. Incorporate as much pink into your wardrobe as possible -- pink tees, pink shirts, pink tops, pink dresses, pink hats, pink scarfs, pink boots, pink skirts, pink jeans, pink heels, pink shoes, pink sneakers, pink shorts etc. You can wear pink pajamas to bed (or to sleepovers) and get a pink robe for lounging around the house -- and don't forget the fuzzy pink slippers. However, don't go too overboard by wearing head-to-toe pink. Even Barbie understands the need for a little variation. Try wearing one or two pink items per outfit, for example: a pink top and pink shoes. Then you can accessorize with more pink if you like!"

      "content": "Be sporty. Of course, Barbie isn't all about high heels and mini-skirts, she like to get active too! But that doesn't mean sweat pants and oversized tees -- Barbie still looks cute when she plays sport or hangs out at the beach. Get some cute, colorful workout gear -- patterned bicycle shorts, stylish yet comfortable sports bras and funky running shoes. You could also wear a pink baseball cap if you're running outside! Barbie loves the beach, so having some pretty swimwear is very important. Go for cute, girly bikinis with frills, bows and beads when you're just hanging out and sunbathing, or choose a functional yet feminine bikini for beach volleyball, swimming, or lifeguard duty."

Hair accessories are a great place to start. Cute pink headbands work nicely, as do sparkly clips, pretty ribbons and flower hair ties. You can also wear cute hats or head scarves. Jewelry is another big one. If you're going for a sophisticated or vintage Barbie look, you should go with pearl necklaces and diamond earrings. More modern accessories include hoop or dangle earrings, colored bangles and chunky beaded necklaces. Don't forget your stylish sunglasses!
