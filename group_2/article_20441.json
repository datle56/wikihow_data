You can just put in the word \"library\" and your town name in the search bar, and the local library branch should pop up. There are even some websites that list all public libraries in a given country. If you want a list of all of the libraries in your state, go to one of these sites. [1] X Research source"

[2] X Research source You may also need to prove your address, which is usually done by bringing in a piece of official mail (a utility bill for instance) that has your name and address on it. [3] X Research source If you are too young to have an official piece of identification, then you will most likely need to go to the library with an adult who has this type of identification. You can get your own library card, but the adult will need to vouch for you. Some libraries want you to fill out a form online, and then go in to a branch to show your identification and pick up your card. This is why it is a good idea to check online about the application process before going into the library."

In many cases, you will want to go up to a desk that has a sign that says something like, \"New Accounts.\" If it is unclear where to go once you enter the library, feel free to ask any employee you see about getting a library card. At the very least, that employee should be able to steer you towards a person who can actually help you."

Some libraries will ask you to fill out a form, while at others you will just give your identification to an employee and they will put your information straight into a computer. Whatever information your library requires, such as your address or date of birth, provide it if the request seems reasonable and you are comfortable giving the information."
