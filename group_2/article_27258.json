[1] X Research source A free-roaming cat has an owner that takes care of it, but allows it to wander around on its own. You should probably not try and befriend a free-roaming cat; if you begin to feed it or let it in your home, it might abandon its owner. Other cats are strays. A stray cat is one that formerly had an owner, but the owner no longer takes care of it, or abandoned the cat. Stray cats may roam widely, taking food and shelter where it can find it. Some stray cats may be willing to make friends with you, or let you pick them up and take them to an animal shelter. Some cats are feral, meaning that they have spent all or nearly all of their lives outdoors and without any human care. Many feral cats were born and raised this way, returning to a nearly-wild state, preferring to stay away from people. Some feral cats are willing to make friends with you, but generally it is difficult to domesticate them."

Make sure that the cat has food, water, a place to bed, and a litter box. You might need to use garden soil in the litter box at first, then a mix of soil and litter, before using just litter. This will help the stray adjust to the texture. Visit the cat regularly. Offer it treats, talk to it soothingly, and try playing with some toys. Pet the cat if it will let you, but leave it alone and come back later if it acts scared or aloof. There is a good chance that the cat will feel comfortable soon, and be ready to leave its room and explore your home. Be patient, however, as the cat might get startled and hide in various places, scratch furniture, or knock things over as it gets used to its new surroundings."
