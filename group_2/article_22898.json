      "content": "Food Hot Takes Do you think peanut butter pickle sandwiches are delicious? What do you think about pineapple on pizza? Throwing in some piping-hot food hot takes can be a great way to really get a conversation going . Ask your friends questions like \"What's your hottest food take?\" or \"What food do people love that's actually terrible?\" Here are our best answers: Plain salted potato chips are better than all the flavored chips. A hot dog is technically a type of taco. Pizza should be eaten with a fork and a knife. Bacon is actually gross and overrated. Duck should be eaten at Thanksgiving, not turkey. Plain water does have a taste. The cookie of the Oreo is way better than the cream. Corn is so good on pizza. Ravioli is just wet pop-tart soup. Spaghetti is a terrible pasta shape. Celery is trash and you should feel bad for liking it."

      "content": "Animal Hot Takes Inspire a little chaos with some fun animal-related hot takes that can really get people talking. You can even ask a couple of questions like, “What underrated animal makes the best pet?” or “What animal do people love that you secretly hate?” to uncover some of the best hot takes, like these: Horses should be house pets. Kangaroos aren’t real—they’re probably just humans in costume. Mini poodles go against the laws of nature. Squirrels should be legally made pets. Sphinx cats are cute and cuddly, not ugly. No further questions. Snakes are adorable, we’ve just been told that they’re scary. Most people would have a pet shark if they could. Mosquitos should just go extinct, who needs ‘em? Dogs aren’t cute. At all."

      "content": "Brand Hot Takes Explore your friends’ or coworkers’ favorite products, streaming services, restaurants, and more by asking them what their controversial opinions are when it comes to branding. Ask them, “Which one is better—Pixar or Disney?” or “What brand is completely overrated?” Share your favorite brand hot takes, like: Dairy Queen is just the Walmart version of Sonic. Android phones are better than Apple phones—Big Apple just wants to take over. MySpace was the best social media. I wish it would come back. If you flatten a McDonald’s cheeseburger into a disk it tastes so much better. Apple Music is so much better than Spotify. Teslas are just glorified toasters on wheels. Netflix’s non-original content is the only reason to subscribe. Drinking Coca-Cola is better when it’s boiled. In-N-Out is not good. Period."

      "content": "Fashion Hot Takes Are you a fashion-forward trendsetter? You may enjoy these haute takes (get it?). Try asking your group, “What is your best fashion hot take?” or “What universally-hated trend do you secretly love?” Here are our favorite answer examples: Designer handbags are so not worth the hype. Denim-on-denim is not a fashion crime. Neon is the best everyday color. Change my mind. We should bring back top hats. Skinny jeans just make everyone look like they have stick legs. Crocs are super fashionable, and everyone should wear them. The whole ‘oversized-clothing’ trend doesn’t look good. People who wear turtleneck sweaters should be locked up. Mullets are actually great hairstyles."

Andre the Giant would’ve been the best goalie! Games should not have slow-motion replays. Football players should have to play offense and defense. Gritty is not a great mascot. Alex Ovechkin is the best hockey player who ever lived. Michael Jordan is an overrated player."

Disco is the best music genre ever created. Emo pop-punk isn’t good, we’re all just angsty and nostalgic now. Hip-hop is dead. Christmas music was meant to be played in the summertime. Harry Styles is not as great as everyone thinks he is. Most Glee covers are better than the original. Blink182 is overrated. Country music slaps."
