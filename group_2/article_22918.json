To access the file and read the messages, go into the Google Drive associated with your husband’s account on a computer. Scan the backup folder for the date you want to take a look at and open it. Any deleted texts should be in there. [1] X Research source Keep in mind, this may be illegal depending on where you live. Some states even make it a felony to snoop through someone’s personal communications without their consent. [2] X Research source If there are no backup files in Google Drive, the odds of accessing a deleted text are extremely low. If you want to turn this on for the future, open the Settings tab in your husband’s phone, tap “Connected Devices,” select “Backup,” and select “Back up now.” Make sure that the SMS box is checked when you do this and Google will backup any texts in the phone. [3] X Research source If you have a Google One subscription, you can set it up to back the messages up automatically."

Unfortunately, they don’t appear to work, and they’re often filled with malware or bloatware that can harm your phone or steal your data. Once an Android text is deleted and the underlying backup data is discarded, the info is gone. If you absolutely have your heart set on giving this a shot, you can try Android Data Recovery, Dr. Fone, Tenorshare UltData, or FonePaw. These are all computer programs that offer free trials and claim to be able to recover deleted texts. [5] X Research source They’re unlikely to recover anything, but at least you’ll be able to sleep easy without wondering if you could have pulled any texts off of his phone. [6] X Research source"

Again, depending on where you live, this may be highly illegal. It’s also probably unethical unless he’s really up to something and you know it and just need proof.

It’s hard to come back from something like that so find an alternative way to assuage your fears if you can. [16] X Research source In some states, it’s a felony to go through someone’s electronic communications—even if you’re married. You really have to make sure that this is something you’re willing to risk if you’re going to go through with it.

That can be hard, but it helps to remember that a marriage is a partnership, and even if something needs addressing, you two are a team. Talk to him about whatever’s bothering you. Maybe you’ve just been misinterpreting this! Either way, you’ll learn more by openly discussing the issue than you will by snooping. [18] X Research source You might say, “Hey, can we chat? You’ve been acting kind of funny lately and it’s secretly tearing me up inside. Is something happening that I need to know about?” You could try, “I’ve noticed you’ve been really guarded about your phone lately. Are you talking to someone that I wouldn’t approve of or something? What’s going on here?” You can also say, “Look, I feel like you’ve been distant lately. I’d really love it if you could open up to me and just tell me if something’s going on.”"

[19] X Research source For example, you could say, “So, I’ve noticed you’ve been staying late at work a lot, and your face just lights up whenever you talk about the new sales rep. Are you cheating on me with her? It’s been tearing me up and I need to know.” You could also say, “I hear the way you’ve been talking on the phone to that old friend of yours, and I know you’ve been deleting text messages. What’s happening here? If you’re having an affair, I deserve to know.” It’s possible he really isn’t cheating and that you’re just misinterpreting things. Try to keep an open mind here."

If he is doing something behind your back and you want to work through this, couples counseling is one of the best first steps to take. If he isn’t doing anything behind your back but you were still thinking about pulling up his old texts, couples counseling may still be a good idea. No matter what obstacle you’re facing in marriage, a therapist or counselor will help you two work together to sort through your problems, improve your communication, and get back to the way things were when everything was smooth! [20] X Research source Couples go to counseling together for all kinds of reasons—it isn’t necessarily a sign that your marriage is even in trouble. Think of relationships like cars; even if your car is perfectly fine, it needs a tune-up every now and then."
