      "content": "Redheads have red hair, either from dye or naturally. Redheads can also be born with red hair, but it may fall more on the reddish-brown side than the orange side. Similarly, a redhead may have red hair from using hair dye instead of having natural red hair. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Gingers typically have pale skin with freckles.",
      "content": "Gingers typically have pale skin with freckles. There’s a reason why people with naturally red hair need so much sunscreen! If you know someone who’s a ginger, they likely have fair skin, and may have a smattering of freckles on their face or body. Natural redheads (or in this case, gingers) typically live in or have ancestors in Scotland or Ireland. [3] X Research source However, red hair can occur naturally within any ethnicity."

      "content": "Redheads can have any skin tone. Unlike someone with naturally reddish/orange hair, a redhead doesn’t necessarily have pale or fair skin. Redheads can have any skin tone, especially since all you have to do to be a redhead is dye your hair. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Ginger can sometimes be considered a negative term. When someone calls someone a “ginger,” they might not mean it in a nice way. Unfortunately, the term ginger is often used to mock people with red hair or call them unattractive. However, many people will use it in a neutral or positive way as well, especially if they’re just using it as a descriptor and not as an insult."

    {
      "title": "Redhead has a wide-ranging, neutral connotation.",
      "content": "Redhead has a wide-ranging, neutral connotation. Saying that someone is a redhead typically has no negative connotations, and it’s just talking about the color of their hair. Usually, redhead is just used as a neutral descriptor of someone. Since people with red hair are rare (less than 2% of the population has natural red hair), many people find those with red hair to be alluring and beautiful. That being said, the term “redhead” can sometimes be used to describe someone who is overly attractive or sexy. However, in general the term has no underlying meanings, and is just a neutral word."

      "content": "No, many people with red hair don’t like being called “ginger.” The word “ginger” can have negative connotations, and is often used as an insult. Lots of people with red hair don’t like being called a ginger, and would rather you just say “redhead” or “person with red hair.” [5] X Research source Everyone is different, and some people might not mind being called a ginger at all. However, if you want to err on the side of caution, don’t call someone a ginger without their permission."

      "content": "Yes, it’s typically acceptable to call someone a redhead. Since the term redhead doesn’t really have anything negative about it, it’s usually a fine phrase to use for someone with red hair. You can use this to describe someone if their red hair is a feature that really sticks out to you."
