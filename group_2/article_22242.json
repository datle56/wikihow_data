      "title": "HEA stands for “happily ever after.”",
      "content": "HEA stands for “happily ever after.” The acronym is mainly used to refer to “happily ever after” endings in books, especially the romance genre, though it can also apply to movies. To have an HEA, the story must wrap up in a perfect or almost perfect way with the main couple ending up together. [1] X Research source The term comes from classic fairy tales, which often end in the phrase “and they lived happily ever after.” Specifically, the term may have originated in The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio in the 14th century. When translated into English, the character Paganino of Monaco marries the widow Bartolomea and “as they were well acquainted, so they lived very lovingly, and happily, ever after.”"

      "title": "In romance books, HEAs are often signified by marriage.",
      "content": "In romance books, HEAs are often signified by marriage. Traditionally, fairy tales employed the phrase “and they lived happily ever after” when two characters get married and ride off into the sunset at the end of the story. While storytelling has changed over the centuries, many romance novelists still choose to give their characters an HEA by having them get engaged, married, and/or have children. This often occurs in an epilogue, months or years after the events of the book. [2] X Research source In order to have an HEA, the characters must be happy and in love with no hints of tension or conflict, no matter what issues they faced earlier in the book."

      "title": "HFN stands for “happy for now.”",
      "content": "HFN stands for “happy for now.” Sometimes, romance books may have an HFN, or “happy for now,” ending rather than an HEA. [3] X Research source The story has a positive outcome as the couple gets together, but it is more focused on short term happiness. An HFN is a more realistic conclusion than an HEA and sometimes hints that there could be conflict in the next book in the series. For example, a character could still be worried about an unfinished plot point from earlier in the book, hinting that the conflict isn’t really over. Or, the characters may have gotten together but they’re just dating. Their story doesn’t end in marriage or kids."

      "content": "In general, the romance genre must include an HEA or HFN. This is sometimes up for debate among readers, but the general consensus is that in order for a book to be considered a romance, it must have a happily ever after, or at least a happy for now ending. Books that end in tragedy or with the characters separating may be considered love stories but don’t technically fall under the romance genre. [4] X Research source For example, while Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet shares the love story between the titular characters, they both die at the end and don’t get an HEA. Therefore, the play is considered a tragedy and not a romance, despite the romantic elements. According to the Romance Writers of America, a romance must have a central love story and an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending. [5] X Research source Most romance readers agree that romance must include a happy ending and say that they would feel disappointed, if not betrayed, if the author failed to give them one."
