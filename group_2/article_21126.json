      "content": "Grind your flaxseed with a flax mill for the easiest, quickest option. A flax mill is a specific appliance similar to a coffee grinder used to grind flaxseed. Take off the lid and pour your seeds into the top with the wide opening. Hold the flax mill over a bowl or plate. Then, simply twist the top clockwise to grind the seeds. You can grind 1 tablespoon (14.8 g) in less than 30 seconds. In addition, you can use a mill to easily top a smoothie or salad with ground flaxseed. If you do not use flaxseed regularly, it may not be cost-effective to invest in this device."
