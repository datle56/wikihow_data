      "content": "Find or create a “Pharaoh.” You can either make a small, human-shaped form out of foil or use a doll, like a barbie doll. If you decide to use a doll, cut off as much of its hair as you can. Otherwise, the head of the mummy will be difficult to wrap. Don’t use someone else’s doll without asking permission. Inexpensive dolls can be bought at grocery stores and discount department stores."

      "content": "Create the papier mâché paste. Add one part water to one part flour in a large mixing bowl. Next, whisk the mixture together to create a smooth paste. [1] X Research source The paste should have the consistency of pancake batter. If it’s too thick, add a few splashes of water. If it’s too thin, sprinkle in more flour. For example, if you use one cup of flour, you will need one cup of water. Add a tablespoon of salt to the paste if you want to prevent molding."

      "content": "Prepare some mummy strips. Tear out small, thin strips of unruled white paper or thin cloth. You can also use newspaper, tissue paper, or paper towels. [2] X Research source If you’re making an authentic-looking mummy, choose white paper or fabric. Otherwise, the mummy will be multicolored. The strips should be about 3-4 inches long (7.5 to 10 centimeters) and half an inch wide (1.3 centimeters)."

      "content": "Wrap the Pharaoh in papier mâché strips. First, dip a strip of paper or fabric into your paste and coat each side. Gently squeeze the strip to remove any excess paste. Next, wrap the strip around the mummy as tightly as you can. Wrap the arms against the body. Mummies usually don’t have individually wrapped arms. If you decide to do more than one layer of papier mâché, let each layer dry completely before adding another."

To test whether or not the mummy is dry, press it gently with a finger. The papier mâché should be chalky and stiff. To speed the drying process, place the mummy under a fan."

Next, carefully make an incision halfway up the side of the sarcophagus. Continue cutting all around the side to create a front half and a back half. If needed, use a pencil to draw a guide line around the sides. Follow this line when cutting the sarcophagus."

Use a combination of red, blue, and green for the other parts of the sarcophagus. Consider adding authentic touches to the outside. For example: Add black and blue accent stripes along the side. Paint on Egyptian symbols, such as the symbol for Anubis. Detail small “offerings” by painting depictions of grain, bread, or gold. [6] X Research source"
