      "content": "Work in a role from the list of eligible skilled occupations. In most instances, you'll only be granted a full working visa in Australia if you're working in an eligible field. Look over the Australia Government’s list of eligible skilled occupations to see if your chosen profession is listed. Even if your exact job title or field isn’t listed, there may be one that uses similar skills which you could switch into. Take a look through the list to see if any of the occupations fit with your working history. If your job isn't on the list of eligible skilled occupations, you won't be able to apply for a working visa in Australia through traditional means. Use the Australian Department of Home Affairs website to look into other visas you may be able to apply for. You can explore visa options here: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-finder Eligible skilled occupations include many roles, such as bakers, butchers, copywriters, and helicopter pilots. If your profession requires some specialist training, it's likely it will be included."

      "content": "Have your skills assessed by the relevant authority. In order to prove that you have the right skills for your chosen job, you'll need to contact the relevant Australian authority and have your skills assessed. Look at the “Assessing Authority” column in the list of eligible skilled occupations, and look online to find out how to contact them. [1] X Research source Each assessing authority has their own rules, regulations, guidelines, and timelines for completing a skills assessment, as well as different contact methods. Look online for the assessing authority you need to get in touch with to find their contact details and get more information. If you're a medical practitioner, barrister, or solicitor, you'll need to be legally allowed to practice your profession in your chosen Australia state before you can apply."

      "title": "Make sure that you have more than 65 points of eligibility.",
      "content": "Make sure that you have more than 65 points of eligibility. Australia has a points system which allows you to quickly work out if you're eligible to live and work there. Use the Australian Immigration “points table” in order to find out how many points of eligibility you have. In order to apply for a working visa, you'll need more than 65 points. [2] X Research source The points table from the Australian Department of Home Affairs can be found here: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/departmental-forms/online-forms/points-calculator You will need to prove all of the claims made in your points evaluation when you complete your Expression of Interest. Points are granted based on a variety of factors, including your age, your English competency, qualifications, and experience in your chosen field. The more desirable you are as a member of Australian society, the more points you will have. For example, you'll be granted more points for a Ph.D. than a high school diploma. If you do not have 65 points, you aren’t eligible for an Australian working visa. Continue upskilling in your chosen field until you have enough points to be eligible."

      "content": "Get the required health exams. Most applications will require that you can prove you won’t be a health risk to the Australian government or public. Talk to your doctor about getting a full examination and a certificate that proves you are eligible to immigrate to Australia. [3] X Research source Your doctor will know which tests they need to run in order to prove that you pass the health requirements. Your health requirements will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth. As such, there’s no checklist of conditions and diseases which will prevent you from being granted a visa. Your family members may also have to meet this health requirement, even if they're not immigrating to Australia with you."

The Expression of Interest (EOI) is a free form that indicates to the Australian Government that you are looking to immigrate to Australia. It's not a visa application but may allow you to find someone willing to sponsor your application. Follow the instructions on the Expression of Interest form through the Skillselect portal. Make sure everything you write in the EOI is true and provable, or else you may not be able to apply for an Australian working visa for up to 10 years. [4] X Research source You may be able to skip this step if there is an employer in Australia who wants to sponsor your application, with the understanding that they will employ you when your visa is approved. This is a Direct Entry steam visa, which has a slightly different process to this visa application.

It can take up to 2 years for your EOI to be processed, so you should continue working and upskilling in your chosen field to increase your chances. [5] X Research source It can often take several months for your EOI to be responded to. Make sure you update the form as your circumstances change or improve so that it remains accurate when it is considered. If you receive an invitation to apply for a visa, you will have to do so within 60 days. It may help to begin organizing all of the required paperwork and evidence needed for your visa application before you receive this invitation. The invitation isn't a guarantee that you'll be granted a visa. There'll be specific eligibility criteria that you need to prove in your visa application before it is approved."

Contact the police departments for each of these countries and follow their process to get this character document. [7] X Research source If you have served in the military of any country, you'll need to provide service records and discharge paper as well as the police certificates.
