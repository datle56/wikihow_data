      "content": "Pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white school glue into a bowl. Most bottles of school glue contain about 4 ounces (120 mL), which is exactly what you need! Don't use clear school glue, because it won't look very cloud-like. [1] X Research source Even though most slime recipes require water, you actually don’t need to add any here. For more interesting-looking slime, add 1 to 2 drops of blue food coloring into it."

      "title": "Add 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) of liquid starch.",
      "content": "Add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of liquid starch. This is your activating ingredient, which you can find in the laundry aisle of just about any store. You can also use a different activating ingredient, such as 1 tablespoon (15 mL) saline solution or 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of borax water. [2] X Research source If you’re using saline solution, ensure that it contains boric acid and sodium borate. You’ll also have to stir 1/4 teaspoon (2.7 g) of baking soda into the glue first. To prepare borax water, mix 1/4 teaspoon (2 g) of borax into 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of warm water. You can find borax in the laundry aisle of a grocery store as well."

      "title": "Stir the starch into the slime, then add more if it feels too sticky.",
      "content": "Stir the starch into the slime, then add more if it feels too sticky. Use a spoon to stir the starch completely into the slime. If the slime is too sticky and oozy, add more starch 1 tablespoon (15 mL) at a time until you get the texture you want. [3] X Research source Set the slime aside while you prepare the instant snow. Don't add more than 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of liquid starch. If you add more than that, the slime will turn hard and rubbery. If the slime is still too stringy, wait for 3 to 5 minutes. This will give the ingredients time to bind together."

      "title": "Prepare 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of instant snow according to the instructions.",
      "content": "Prepare 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of instant snow according to the instructions. Purchase a can of instant snow online or from a craft store (during the holiday season, only). Read the instructions on the can to find out how much snow powder and water you should use, then mix them together. [4] X Research source Instant snow is not the same thing as the fake spray-on snow or the plastic-like, flakey stuff that comes in bags. If you can't find instant snow, pour water into a diaper, wait for it to expand, then cut it open and pull the instant snow out. [5] X Research source Alternatively, use your hands or a grater to crush enough white Styrofoam to fill up 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL). Try to make it as fine as possible. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the prepared instant snow into the slime. Pour the snow onto the slime, then fold the edges of the slime over the snow. Knead the slime to mix the snow into it. Start with about 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of instant snow first, then add more if desired. [7] X Research source The more snow you add, the firmer your slime will be. If your slime is still too gooey after this, add a few drops of liquid starch into it. If you have snow left over, allow it to dry out first, then return it to the can."

      "title": "Store the slime in a plastic container or ziplock bag when you aren't playing with it.",
      "content": "Store the slime in a plastic container or ziplock bag when you aren't playing with it. How long this slime keeps its texture depends on what you put into it. If you used instant snow or the absorbent powder from a diaper, you may notice a difference in texture after a few days. If you used crushed Styrofoam, it should keep for at least a week. Instant snow dries out after a couple of hours/days. Since it's already mixed into your slime, it probably won't dry out completely, but your slime may harden a bit."

      "content": "Pour 2 2 ⁄ 3 cups (630 mL) of school glue into a bowl. If you can, use white school glue, as it will look more cloud-like. [8] X Research source Clear school glue is a good alternative; the addition of the shaving cream will help make the slime opaque. [9] X Research source For more interesting slime, add 2 to 3 drops of blue food coloring."

      "content": "Fold 2 cups (470 mL) of white shaving cream into the glue. Measure out the shaving cream and add it to the bowl. Next, gently stir it into the glue with a rubber spatula. Make sure that you use the actual foaming kind of shaving cream and not the gel kind; otherwise, the slime won't be fluffy. [10] X Research source Men's shaving cream would be the best choice, because its white color is the most cloud-like. Women's shaving cream often comes tinted pink or purple, which isn't very cloud-like. Avoid this—unless, of course, you want a pink or purple cloud!"

Add the starch into the glue 1 tablespoon (15 mL) at a time until you get the texture you want; stir the slime well after each addition of starch that you add. [11] X Research source Set the slime aside while you prepare the instant snow. This will also give the slime more time to achieve a less-icky texture. If you just want to make fluffy slime, you are done! Adding instant snow or crushed Styrofoam will help give it more texture, but that’s all. [12] X Research source Most grocery stores carry liquid starch in the laundry aisle."

You can find it online or at a craft store during the holiday season. Read the instructions on the back of the can to find out how to prepare the snow, then measure out 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL). [13] X Research source Instant Snow is different from fake spray-on snow or the fake, powdery snow that comes in a bag. If you can't find instant snow, pour water into a diaper, then wait for it to expand. Cut the diaper open and pull the snow out. It's more or less the same thing! [14] X Research source Another option is to crush some white Styrofoam into a fine powder with your fingers or a grater. Use enough to fill 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL). [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the slime into a sealed container when you're done playing with it. Because this slime contains shaving cream, it will start to lose its texture after a couple of hours to a couple of days. It may still be slimy and cloud-like afterwards, but it just won't be fluffy anymore. Slime made from Styrofoam will keep its texture much longer than slime made from instant snow. This is because instant snow dries out over time."
