      "content": "Evaluate placement options for outdoor and indoor living walls. You may already have an idea of where you want your living wall to be, but you should take into account other considerations, like the weight of your living wall, the amount of sunlight your wall gets throughout the day (and year), and removal or disposal concerns. Even if you're someone who has a green thumb, at some point one of your plants may need to be replaced. In this case, a living wall close to a door outside can prevent dirt or decayed plant matter from being tracked through your house. Take a stud finder and make sure your wall has weight bearing studs . Even the weight of a single plant with its roots saturated with water may be enough to pull your living wall free from wall anchors. Fastening your living wall firmly to two studs should prevent this. Imagine your living wall at different times of the year. For example, you may find that an outdoors living wall looks less desirable in the winter months if you live in a temperate climate. A living wall close to a large window might also be negatively impacted by cold during cold months. [2] X Research source"

Lay these along the wood on the inside of your pallet and use your staple gun to firmly attach each strip in place. Be sure that every spot soil will be held is thoroughly protected with heavy plastic sheeting. In the event you don't have a staple gun, you can use tacks and a hammer instead. Make sure you use sturdy tacks that will stay firmly in place; a rupture in your plastic can lead to leakage that could damage your wall or dirty your floor. To ensure the health of your plants, you'll have to water your living wall regularly, which can cause the wood of your pallet to become compromised by rot or decay. Your plastic sheeting will prevent this from happening to the wood of your pallet."

This will prevent leakage of water and dirt from the back of your living wall. You may want to consider using some kind of adhesive to guarantee a proper seal between the plastic and the back of your pallet. A general purpose, water resistant sealer, which should be available at your local hardware store, should work nicely. [6] X Research source"
