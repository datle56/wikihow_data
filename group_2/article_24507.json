      "content": "Exfoliates the scalp. Salt is one of the most popular ingredients in scalp and body exfoliators because it instantly removes dead skin cells. Because it’s a physical exfoliant, the salt crystals in seawater may remove product build up at your roots, alleviate itchiness on your scalp, and get rid of any flakes or dandruff.

      "content": "May stimulate hair growth. Since salt water acts as a natural exfoliant, massaging it into the scalp is believed by some to increase blood flow and circulation. This promotes more oxygen and nutrients to your hair follicle, which may encourage faster hair growth and fuller-looking strands. [8] X Research source In fact, regular scalp massages can reduce hair shedding and minimize certain yeasts that damage your hair follicles.

      "title": "Boosts hair volume.",
      "content": "Boosts hair volume. When you soak your hair in salt water, the salt swells the hair shaft and cuticle, making your hair appear more voluminous and textured. Too much swelling can create excess tangles, but just the right amount gives you an effortless beachy look. [10] X Research source If you're not near the beach, use a sea salt spray to add more texture and volume to your hair before styling it."

      "content": "Too much salt water can damage your hair, especially if it’s color-treated. While salt water has many benefits, it can harm your scalp and strands if you use it every day. Salt water draws water away from the hair shaft, leaving your hair dehydrated, tangled, and more prone to breakage. This is especially harmful if your hair is dyed or bleached since chemical treatments strip the hair of nutrients; using salt water further damages your hair and may even fade the color. [11] X Research source Hair damage can occur from swimming in the ocean or applying sea salt sprays, so only use salt water 1-2 times a week and take precautions to protect your hair. Salt water can dry out and discolor your hair if you leave it on for too long, so make sure you rinse it off before heading to sleep."

      "title": "Coat your hair with oil before salt water exposure.",
      "content": "Coat your hair with oil before salt water exposure. To prevent water from leaving your hair shaft, apply a reef-friendly hair oil all over your strands. Use enough oil to coat your entire head, then wait 10 minutes before entering the water. This gives your hair enough time to fully absorb the oil. [13] X Research source The oil keeps your hair protected and hydrated, while letting your scalp enjoy all the benefits of the salt water."

      "title": "Wash your hair immediately after seawater exposure.",
      "content": "Wash your hair immediately after seawater exposure. Salt crystals can remain in your hair if you don’t rinse them out thoroughly, drying out your strands and damaging the cuticle. To prevent this from happening, rinse your hair with clean, fresh water as soon as you leave the beach, and wash your hair with a hydrating shampoo and conditioner to restore moisture. [14] X Research source Look for hair products with nourishing ingredients like vitamin E, jojoba oil, argan oil, coconut oil, and honey."

Wash your hair with this mixture like a regular shampoo, then rinse your hair with clean water to remove any remaining salt crystals. [15] X Research source You can make as much shampoo as you like and store it in a sealed container, but the ratio is 2 parts castile soap with 3 parts sea salt."

      "content": "Make a soothing scalp treatment with salt, coconut oil, and leave-in conditioner. In a small spray bottle, dissolve 1 tablespoon (21.3 g) of sea salt into 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of warm water. Then, add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of coconut oil and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of leave-in conditioner into the salt water solution. Stir until everything is thoroughly combined, and spray it directly over your scalp to relieve any itchiness or irritation. [17] X Research source Sea salt spray and other texturizing or dry shampoo sprays can help add a little bit of grip to your hair. They help to keep your hair in place and also create beach waves. You can use a spray after bathing when your hair is wet. Do not rub your hair. Squeeze out the water and blot your hair with a towel. After applying the spray, do not touch your hair. Let the sea spray work. The salt will dry the parts where it is applied. If you scratch your hair, it can lead to frizzing."
