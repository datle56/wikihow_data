      "content": "Hang Statuses were a special status you got when in a voice channel. The Hang Status feature was experimental, and it was not available to all Discord users. If you were in a server with the Hang Status feature, you could set a special status in the voice chat to display what you were doing. If the server you're in had the Hang Status feature, you'd see an icon next to your name under the voice channel you're in. If there was no icon, that server didn't have access to the Hang Status feature."

      "content": "You could only set a Hang Status in a voice channel. Hang Statuses are different from normal Discord status messages. However, just like a status message, your Hang Status would be displayed below your name in server member lists and on your profile. Once you leave a voice channel, the Hang Status would be removed, and your regular Discord status (if you had one) would be displayed again."

      "content": "Hang Statuses could be cleared if you didn't want to have one. However, you had to do this manually each time you entered a voice channel. There was no way to disable Hang Statuses in either user settings or a server's settings."

      "title": "Hang Statuses could be set on desktop or mobile.",
      "content": "Hang Statuses could be set on desktop or mobile. On mobile, Hang Statuses were called \"Voice Activity,\" but worked exactly the same. Desktop: Join a voice channel. Click the icon next to your name. Then, select one of the predefined Hang Statuses, create your own, or clear the Hang Status. Mobile: Join a voice channel. Swipe upwards and tap Set Voice Activity . Then, select one of the predefined Hang Statuses, create your own, or clear the Hang Status."
