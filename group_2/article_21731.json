      "content": "Buy a set of eyelet curtains with an even number of grommets. This is very important, because the number of grommets affects the way that you thread the curtain onto the rod. If the curtain has an odd number of eyelets, the edges of the curtain won't lay properly against the wall. Match the color and style of the curtains to the room that you are hanging them in."

      "content": "Find out or measure the inside width of the grommets. [1] X Expert Source Angelica Savard Home Stager, Realtor, & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 April 2020. The rod you buy needs to be thin enough to slide through the curtain's grommets. Most rods should be thin enough to do this, but it wouldn't hurt to get the exact measurements. Check the packaging that your curtains came in. If you can't find the grommet size on the label, use a ruler to measure the inside width on 1 of the grommets. If you don't want to measure, a rod with a width between 1 3 ⁄ 8 to 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.5 to 3.8 cm) will probably work for most eyelet curtains."

This will give you the length of the curtain rod. For example, if your rod is 54 inches (140 cm): 54 x 1/3 = 18 18 + 54 = 72 Final curtain rod length: 72 inches"

      "content": "Buy a curtain rod that's the right length and matches the grommets. The rod should be the same shade and color as the grommets on your curtain. It should also small enough to slide through them. If the length you need falls between 2 standard sizes, choose the larger size. [3] X Research source Matching the shade is important. A light silver rod won't look good against dark silver grommets. Check the label when buying the curtain rod. Some measurements include the finials while others don't. You need to look at the measurement without the finials."

      "content": "Buy matching finials for the rod, if needed. Finials are the ornamental stoppers on both ends of a curtain rod. They prevent the curtains from sliding off the rod. Many curtain rods already come with these. If your curtain rod doesn't come with them, buy them separately, but make sure that they match."

Read the washing instructions to find out what temperature setting you should use on the iron—or if you can iron the fabric in the first place. An alternative to ironing is steaming the curtains with a steamer. If you can't iron or steam the curtains, drape the curtains across your bed for several hours up to an entire day. This will help relax any creases. [4] X Research source"

In general, brackets are mounted 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the window frame, and about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to either side of it. You can deviate from these measurements if you want to alter the proportions of your window. For example: If you want your window to appear taller, place the brackets 8 inches (20 cm) above the window, or closer to the ceiling or crown molding.

They're cheap and can prevent you from mistakenly hanging the curtains without a stud to support them. Make sure that the wall anchors can hold the weight of the rod and the curtains."
