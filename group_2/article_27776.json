Then, plant the Hops Starter in tilled soil on your Farm and water it consistently. In 11 days, harvest your first Hops plant—it will continue to yield a new Hops plant every other day after this point. [1] X Research source A Hops Starter costs 60 gold at Pierre’s General Store, 75 gold at JojaMart, and anywhere from 100 to 1,000 gold at the Traveling Cart. If you go shopping at the Night Market during 16th day of Winter, you can purchase a Hops Starter for 60 gold. Want to speed up your harvest time? Place Speed-Gro, Deluxe Speed-Gro, or Hyper Speed-Gro to speed up the growing time by 10% (9 total days), 25% (8 total days), or 35% (7 total days) respectively. [2] X Research source You can grow Hops throughout the year if you’ve unlocked the Greenhouse (by completing the Pantry Community Center Bundle or buying it from the Joja Community Development Forum). [3] X Research source You can also grow Hops year-round on Ginger Island (unlocked by fixing up Willy’s boat after finishing the Community Center or Joja Warehouse). [4] X Research source"

To make your own Keg, reach a level 8 skill level in Farming and use 30 Wood, 1 Copper Bar, 1 Iron Bar, and 1 Oak Resin to construct one."

It takes her 3 in-game days to completely finish a requested upgrade. [6] X Research source Robin’s store is open every day except Tuesday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (in-game hours). On Fridays, she closes an hour early. [7] X Research source You’ll need to upgrade your Farmhouse twice before the cellar upgrade is available. The first upgrade costs 10,000 gold and 450 Wood, while the second upgrade costs 50,000 gold and 150 Hardwood. [8] X Research source"

If you need Pale Ale (like for the “Pam Is Thirsty” quest) but you don’t have the resources to make it yourself, check the Traveling Cart that’s located southwest of your Farmhouse on Friday and Sunday (between the in-game hours of 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM). If you’re especially lucky, Pale Ale might pop up in the shop. You’ll have to play the long game when shopping from the Traveling Cart. Since so many items have a chance at showing up, there isn’t a high chance of Pale Ale appearing right away."
