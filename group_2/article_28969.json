      "title": "Tear 2 pieces of toilet paper slightly larger than the size you want your wound.",
      "content": "Tear 2 pieces of toilet paper slightly larger than the size you want your wound. The paper will act like the skin of the cut and serve as the overall foundation of the wound. [1] X Research source Once you have the size of paper you need, tear another section to match, so you have 2 nearly identical pieces. For example, if you’re making a wound on your hand, you may only need half of one square of toilet paper. For larger wounds, you may need two or three squares. Tissue paper, such as Kleenex, also works. But it’s best to use tissue paper with no design or markings as these could appear in the final product."

      "content": "Paint glue onto the area of the skin where you want to make your wound. Pour a bit of skin-safe glue onto some wax paper or into a cup. Then, using a paintbrush or makeup brush, paint your skin with a thin layer of glue. [2] X Research source Use enough glue so the toilet paper can stick firmly to the area but not enough to where glue drips down your skin. Yang recommends using Elmer’s school glue as it’s non-toxic, safe to put on the skin, and easy to remove. [3] X Expert Source Nini Efia Yang Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 27 August 2019."

      "title": "Apply the paper onto the painted area of the skin.",
      "content": "Apply the paper onto the painted area of the skin. While the glue is still wet, lay the first layer of toilet or tissue paper on your skin. Press down firmly to ensure the paper sticks. Then, paint another layer of glue over the paper and apply the second piece of paper. [4] X Research source Two layers is standard for this type of fake wound, but adding more paper helps give the wound more depth. If you want to create a deeper cut or gash, add 3 to 5 layers of paper and glue."

      "title": "Paint the edges of the paper with glue to secure it in place.",
      "content": "Paint the edges of the paper with glue to secure it in place. Allow the layers of glued paper to dry on your skin. Then, go in with another layer of glue around the edges of the paper. Work your brush and glue to flatten the edges so they blend into your skin. This will help the wound look more realistic. [5] X Research source Pro tip: Use a hairdryer to help the glue dry faster."

Use a foundation that matches your skin tone for the best results. [6] X Research source Pro tip: Use a flat foundation brush for this step to evenly distribute the foundation."

      "content": "Cut and tear the paper to create an opening for the wound. Take a pair of scissors or tweezers and cut a hole or gash into the center of the paper. This will be the opening of your fake wound or cut. Use your fingers to arrange and tear the paper further. [7] X Research source Get creative with how you tear or cut the paper! You can cut a straighter line for a cleaner, gash-like wound or opt for something more random to represent a zombie or animal bite. Be careful while cutting. It’s best to cut just a little slit to create an opening in the paper, then tear and peel the rest of it with your fingers. Don’t remove the torn tissue paper from the area. This extra paper will help give your wound a peeling look and add more depth."

      "title": "Color in the wound with eyeshadow.",
      "content": "Color in the wound with eyeshadow. Now it’s time to get creative! Use eyeshadow and a makeup brush to color in the remaining paper. Think about what a wound would really look like on your skin. Would it bruise? Would it be green, blue, or even red? Use gentle, dabbing strokes to apply the makeup to avoid tearing the paper further. For a basic wound, fill the area closest to the tear with a pink or red shadow. Then, blend a dark purple and/or blue around the edges. Throw in a bit of green and yellow to mimic bruising . For a zombie bite, have fun with zombie-like colors! Mix blue and green around the wound with earthy silvers and grays. Add a bit of purple and red to represent burst blood vessels. Extend the coloring as far as you’d like. You can keep the shadow contained to just near the wound, or you can blend it out to where you brushed on foundation. Not sure how to color your wound or cut?

Focus the blood inside the paper tear, then use a paintbrush or makeup brush to move it around to your liking. [8] X Research source Add as much or as little blood as you like! Just remember that you can always add more, but you can’t as easily remove blood. To make the blood drips look real, apply a few drops to an area and then let it run downward. For example, if you made a gash on your arm, apply the blood to the top of the wound and then let your arm hang naturally to allow the blood to trickle down. [9] X Research source Don’t have fake blood on hand? Try making your own with corn syrup or flour. To remove the fake wound, gently peel away the tissue paper and wash your skin with makeup remover and/or soap."

      "content": "Apply a layer of Vaseline to where you want the fake wound to be. With your finger, spread a thick layer of petroleum jelly on your skin. The thicker the layer, the more swollen the wound or cut will look. Once applied, use your finger to blend out and smooth the edges of the petroleum jelly into your skin. [10] X Research source This method works best for creating smaller wounds. To make the petroleum jelly more paste-like, mix it with some baby powder to give it more structure and moldability. Essentially, this makes DIY scar wax. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw a line in the petroleum jelly with a toothpick to create a cut. Use a toothpick to gently carve a line out of the center of the petroleum jelly. This creates an open wound effect. If you’re going for a stabbed effect, make the line a little uneven, but keep it relatively thin. If you’re going for a larger cut or gash, carve a larger area that’s a bit wider. Pro tip: If you don’t have a toothpick, use a dull pencil."

Then, use an eyeshadow or makeup brush to apply color to the inside and surrounding areas of the fake wound. Use dabbing rather than swiping motions to keep the petroleum jelly intact. Use a darker shade of brown or gray in the center of the cut to add depth. At the edges, use a light pink/peach tone to blend the edges of the wound to your actual skin tone. Use red and brown shadows around the center to make the wound look fresher. For a more bruised look, Yang suggests blending blue and yellow eyeshadows.

Yang describes liquid latex like Elmer’s glue. It’s easy to apply, dries clear like regular school glue, and peels off super easily.

Liquid latex dries pretty quickly, so work in smaller sections rather than one large area for the best results. [17] X Research source Pro tip: If there are areas that don’t stick to the latex, simply tear them away. This can also give your wound a tattered, gnawed effect."

      "content": "Apply at least one more layer of latex and tissue paper. The more layers you add, the thicker your fake wound will be. Brush on more latex on or around the tissue paper you previously added, then press another piece of paper on top of the newly applied latex. Keep adding more latex and paper until you’re satisfied with the wound’s size and height. [18] X Research source Pro tip: Rub and tear the tissue paper so it doesn’t look symmetrical for a more realistic look."
