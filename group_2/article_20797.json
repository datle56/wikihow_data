      "content": "Restrain the cow before giving the injection. It is much easier and safer to give injections to cattle that are restrained. You can use a head gate or squeeze chute (also called a crush) to restrain the cow. No matter what method of restraint you use, make sure that the cow is restrained well enough that it will not be able to injure you or someone else. [1] X Research source A squeeze chute or cattle crush is a narrow stall with adjustable sides wide enough for 1 adult cow. The panels prevent the animal from moving. It may also have a calming effect on the animal. There’s also a gate in the front and back of the chute to keep the cow still. This makes the neck easily accessible for injections."

The drug manufacturer is obliged by law to print instructions on the injection bottle as well as warnings, information about the targeted microorganisms, and other important details. [2] X Research source If there is an option to choose between an intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SQ) injection route, always go for the SQ as it is less invasive, which means it is less likely to damage valuable carcass meat. [3] X Research source However, some drugs need to be given by IM injection to be properly absorbed."

      "title": "Find the injection site.",
      "content": "Find the injection site. The required site for injection, particularly in beef cattle, is a site called the \" injection triangle. \" This triangular area is located on either side of the cow’s neck and contains few vital structures (like blood vessels and nerves). The injection triangle is broadest at the shoulder and tapers up towards the ear. The retail value of meat from this site is lower than the rump, so you are less likely to lose money if you are planning on selling the meat. The landmarks for finding the triangle are: [4] X Trustworthy Source Michigan State University Extension Extension program of Michigan State University focused on community outreach, education, and engagement Go to source The upper boundary is located below the spinal column following the line of the neck crest. The lower or angular boundary runs along and above the jugular furrow, which is located in the middle of the neck. The posterior boundary (the one closest to the rear of the animal) follows the line above the point of the shoulder, which angles up towards the top-line or top of the shoulder."

      "title": "Select the syringe or dosing gun.",
      "content": "Select the syringe or dosing gun. The difference between the 2 is that with a syringe, you manually control how much of the drug gets injected into the cow. The dosing gun dispenses pre-set volumes of medicine for administering them to more than 1 animal. A syringe is made up of 3 parts: the body (that contains the drug), the plunger (that fits snugly inside the barrel), and the needle. Syringes are plastic and you use them no more than once or twice before they need to be thrown away. Plastic syringes come in 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 20, 35, and 60 cc (1 cc = 1 mL) sizes. Use the syringe size required for the dose you are giving. A dose in a syringe should only be used for 1 animal. A dosing gun or pistol syringe has a glass barrel (loaded with multiple doses) with a plunger that has a thick rubber washer at the end to form a vacuum, a needle, and a handle-trigger that is the same as that on a caulking gun. Some guns have the option of attaching a bottle. Dosing guns come in 5, 12.5, 20, 25, and 50 mL sizes."

      "title": "Vary the injection sites.",
      "content": "Vary the injection sites. This is if you have more than one medication or vaccination to give. The next shot should be administered in a place that is at least 4 inches (10 cm) (about a palm’s width) away from the first shot site. [5] X Research source If you keep putting medication into the same spot, the cow’s body will have a harder time absorbing it. The medications could also interact and become ineffective or they could cause an adverse reaction that may injure or kill the animal."

      "title": "Choose a needle based on the animal's weight.",
      "content": "Choose a needle based on the animal's weight. Needle size is measured in ‘gauges’. The gauge of a needle is inversely proportional to its diameter, so the lower the gauge, the bigger the needle. For instance, a calf's skin is thinner than that of an adult cow, so a finer and higher gauge needle can be used instead. Use the finest gauge possible to make sure that the cow feels as little pain as possible, but not so fine that risk of breaking the needle is significant. [6] X Research source To give an injection to a calf weighing less than 500 pounds, an 18-20 gauge (g) needle with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) length is ideal. For larger animals weighing over 500 pounds, you will need a 16-18 g needle with of 1 ½ inch length. Breed can also play a part on determining needle gauge. Black Angus cattle tend to have thinner hides than Herefords, for instance, so you won't need a 16 g needle to pierce the thinner hide of an Angus cow, versus the thicker one of a Hereford."

    {
      "title": "Choose needle length based on the type of injection.",
      "content": "Choose needle length based on the type of injection. You will need a shorter needle for subcutaneous injections, and a longer needle for intramuscular and intravenous injections. [7] X Research source You won't need a needle longer than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm), for SQ injections because you only need to penetrate the skin. For IM and IV injections, needles that are around 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) or more are best."

      "title": "Use a new, sterile needle for every 10 to 15 injections.",
      "content": "Use a new, sterile needle for every 10 to 15 injections. It is acceptable to use the same needle for up to 15 injections as long as it remains sharp and straight. Always change to a new needle when drawing from a different bottle of medication because using the old needle may introduce contamination. [8] X Research source Never attempt to straighten a bent or burred needle because it is much more likely to break on you or break off in the process of injection. Burred needles are also to never be straightened, but simply tossed into a bio-hazard bin."

[9] X Research source This makes it easier for you to draw in the contents. Then, you can poke the needle into the rubber cap. The rubber cap will act as a vacuum to keep air out of the bottle, and when the needle is pushed through, this vacuum will not be disrupted."

After you have pushed the air in your syringe into the bottle, raise the bottle up so that it is almost vertical above the syringe, and slowly pull back on the plunger. Draw the fluid into the syringe up to the desired amount. [10] X Research source It's important to raise the bottle above the syringe to allow gravity to draw the fluid in, and so that you're not drawing in air instead."

Press and rub the injection site with your hand for a few seconds so that the spot does not bleed too much and to insure the injected fluid does not leak out too much. An SQ injection should not bleed nearly as much as an IM or IV injection, if at all, but there is greater risk of injected fluid leaking out. This leakage might be profuse if the skin is really tight or too much fluid is injected into 1 site."

      "title": "Reduce the painful feeling of the needle plunging in.",
      "content": "Reduce the painful feeling of the needle plunging in. Because intramuscular injections are more painful than a SQ injection, efforts must be made to reduce the pain that a cow will feel when the needle is put in. To lessen the pain then, most veterinarians firmly thump the heel of their hand against the cow’s neck two or three times prior to introducing the needle. It's highly recommended you follow this procedure. [14] X Research source Thumping the cow’s neck with your hand desensitizes the nerves so when the needle goes in, the cow is less likely to feel the needle going in and become startled."

      "content": "Put the needle into the cow’s neck. Keeping the needle perpendicular to the skin surface and a using firm, thrusting movement, push the needle through the skin into the muscle. This must be done immediately after the neck has been thumped a few times. The cow may flinch at this point, so be ready for it to move around a little in the chute, or a bit more if it's not used to human contact. Check to see if you have hit a vein or artery. To do this, withdraw the plunger of the syringe a small amount and look for blood back-flow. If you find blood going into the syringe, you’ve hit a blood vessel. You will have to withdraw and try a different site about 1 in (2.5 cm) from this site. [16] X Research source"

Slowly depress the plunger until the cow has received the correct dose. If you are giving more than 10 milliliters (0.34 fl oz) IM, be sure to give no more than 10 milliliters (0.34 fl oz) per injection site.

If air is present in the syringe where the medication has been injected, hold the syringe upright and tap it using your fingers, until the air bubbles go up. [20] X Research source Disperse the bubbles further by slightly depressing the plunger until all the air bubbles have noticeably gone out.
