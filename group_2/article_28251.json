      "title": "A gel or a styling cream will help hold your curls in place.",
      "content": "A gel or a styling cream will help hold your curls in place. A styling cream is a little lighter, while gel is a little heavier. While your hair is still wet, pour a quarter-sized amount of product into your hands. Flip your hair over and use your fingers to rake the products into your hair, spreading it out evenly. [1] X Research source When your hair dries with the product in it, it will help establish your curls and keep them in place all day. If your gel feels crunchy as your hair dries, don’t worry—once your hair is completely dry, you can simply use your hands to scrunch your hair and break the crunchy gel cast. Your curls will stay in place and your hair will feel bouncy and light."

      "title": "Scrunching helps lift up your hair and promotes tighter curls.",
      "content": "Scrunching helps lift up your hair and promotes tighter curls. When your hair is wet from the shower, grab your product of choice, and put it into the palm of your hands, then lean over to one side. Start from the bottom and scrunch the product into your hair, pushing upward toward your scalp. Keep scrunching product in the same way all over your head to lift and curl your hair. [2] X Research source You can also try flipping your head upside down to scrunch in products."

      "title": "These brushes with a plastic bristle help curl small sections of your hair.",
      "content": "These brushes with a plastic bristle help curl small sections of your hair. To use a Denman brush, wait until you get out of the shower so your hair is completely wet. Apply your leave-in conditioner or cream styler, then flip your head over and brush all of your hair through with the brush. Stand back up straight and part your hair normally, then grab a 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) wide section of hair. Start at the roots and brush your hair up and away from your head. [3] X Research source Use the same technique all over your hair, making sure you get the back, too. Denman brushes have thick, spaced-out bristles to encourage curls. Brushing your hair up and away from your head promotes smaller, tighter curls."

      "title": "Curling your hair around your fingers can make smaller curls.",
      "content": "Curling your hair around your fingers can make smaller curls. While your hair is wet from the shower, put half of it up into a loose bun with a clip. Rake a styling cream or conditioner into the ends of your hair, then grab a 1 in (2.5 cm) section of hair from the bottom of your head. Grab that section from the bottom, then twist it around 1 of your fingers to create a tight curl. When you let it go, it should be in a spiral ringlet formation. [4] X Research source Continue grabbing 1 in (2.5 cm) around your entire head, curling them around your finger one at a time. Once you’ve finger coiled your entire head, you can let your hair dry naturally or dry it with a diffuser. Finger coiling is fairly labor-intensive, especially if you have thick hair. However, many people swear by it, saying that they get the most definition and the least frizz after finger coiling."

      "title": "Plopping",
      "content": "Plopping involves wrapping your hair on top of your head to promote curls. After you’ve gotten out of the shower and you’ve applied your hair product, spread a cotton T-shirt or a microfiber out flat on a bed or a table. Flip your head over and lay your hair down in the middle of the towel or the T-shirt, then wrap the towel or the shirt around your hair. To keep everything in place, tie a knot on the front of your forehead. [5] X Research source You can plop your hair for about 10 to 15 minutes as you get dressed or put your makeup on. Then, take your hair down and let it air dry or dry it with a diffuser. Plopping helps remove the majority of the water from your hair without drying it out or making it frizzy. It also promotes volume and can give you tighter, more defined curls."

      "content": "If you have fine hair, thick, heavy conditioner can weigh it down. When you’re trying to turn your waves into curls, the last thing you want to do is make them heavy. Pick out a light daily conditioner rather than a deep conditioning treatment and apply it to your mids and ends after you shampoo. [6] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019. Conditioner adds some much-needed moisture back into your hair after you wash it. Without it, your hair will probably be frizzy."

      "title": "Hair masks add intense hydration back into your hair.",
      "content": "Hair masks add intense hydration back into your hair. The more hydrated your hair is, the more it will curl up. Once a week, use a hair mask or a deep conditioning treatment that contains coconut oil, argan oil, almond oil, or avocado oil to leave it feeling shiny and healthy. [7] X Research source Using a hair mask or a deep conditioner too often can weigh down your curls and make them flat, which is why you should stick to using a hair mask once a week or so."

      "title": "If the ends of your hair aren’t curling, try this.",
      "content": "If the ends of your hair aren’t curling, try this. After you get out of the shower, spritz a leave-in conditioner product over the ends of your hair. The conditioner won’t weigh your waves or your curls down, and it will help keep your hair hydrated all day long. [8] X Research source If you have fine hair, the last thing you want to do is weigh down your curls with a ton of products. In this case, less is more. If you have thick hair, you might want to add a hair oil to the ends of your hair as well. It will help combat frizz and promote your curls."

      "content": "If you use heat tools (like a hair dryer), protect your hair first. While your hair is still wet from the shower, spray a heat protectant spray all over, then give it a few minutes to dry. [9] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019.

      "content": "A diffuser attachment minimizes frizz and promotes curls. Before you start drying your hair, put a diffuser onto your hair dryer. Then, flip your head over and start drying your hair from the bottom up to promote volume and curls. [10] X Research source You don’t have to dry your hair all the way—in fact, some people find that drying their hair about halfway and then leaving the rest to air dry helps tamp down frizz and promote curls."

      "content": "Using a normal brush can make wavy hair frizzy. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb or even your fingers to gently tease apart snarls and tangles. Start from the bottom of your hair and work your way up to avoid tearing or ripping your hair as you comb it. [11] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019. In general, brushing curly and wavy hair makes it frizzy. Try to brush and comb it as little as possible, and go gently whenever you do."

      "content": "Damaged hair won’t curl as well as healthy hair. If you haven’t gotten a haircut in a while, now’s the time! Head to a professional and ask for a small trim to get rid of your dead ends. You don’t have to cut a ton off—even 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) will help define your waves and make your hair look curlier. [12] X Research source Experts recommend getting a trim every 6 to 8 weeks."

      "content": "If your hair is damaged, you might need a deep treatment. Hair that used to be curly that is now wavy might benefit from a bond multiplier that helps repair and restore your hair. Look for a product like this at your local beauty store, and follow the instructions carefully. You’ll probably see results within a few weeks or months. [13] X Research source The most common bond multiplier product is Olaplex, and you can buy versions for home use instead of getting the salon kind."
