      "content": "Place half of the tea in a jar. To perfume the tea with the scent of jasmine, you’ll need a glass jar with a large opening and a lid. Add ¼ cup (8 g) of loose leaf green or black tea to the bottom of the jar in an even layer. [1] X Research source Jasmine tea is usually made with green or black tea, but you can substitute white or oolong if you prefer."

      "title": "Cover the tea with jasmine flowers.",
      "content": "Cover the tea with jasmine flowers. To effectively perfume the tea, you should use fresh jasmine flowers. Add about a handful of the flowers, or as many as necessary to create a layer that covers the tea leaves. [2] X Research source You can purchase fresh jasmine flowers at many nurseries and florists. However, you may prefer to grow your own so you have a steady supply."

      "title": "Add another layer of tea over the flowers.",
      "content": "Add another layer of tea over the flowers. After you’ve placed the jasmine over the tea, sprinkle another ¼ cup (8 g) of the tea leaves over the flowers. Make sure that the tea is in an even layer by tapping the jar gently against a flat surface. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Set a weight on top of the tea to compress it and cover the jar.",
      "content": "Set a weight on top of the tea to compress it and cover the jar. You want the tea and jasmine to be pressed tightly together so the scent of the flower can fully infuse the tea. Place a small can or other heavy item inside the jar on top of the tea, and place the lid on the jar. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the tea sit for at least a day.",
      "content": "Let the tea sit for at least a day. In order for the jasmine to really perfume the tea, you must leave them compacted together for at least 24 hours. The longer that you allow them to sit together, the stronger the jasmine scent will be, so you can leave them for up to 3 weeks if you like. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the weight out of the jar. After you’ve allowed the tea and jasmine to sit for at least a day, remove the lid from the jar and lift out the weight. You can remove the jasmine flowers from the tea leaves if you like or leave the mixture together. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Store the tea in a cool, dark location. If you aren’t planning on making a cup of tea right away, place the lid back on the jar. Place it in a spot where it won’t get too hot or receive direct sunlight, such as a pantry. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Add 8 to 10 ounces (237 to 296 ml) of water to kettle or pot, and place it on the stove. Heat the water on high until it comes to a boil, which should take approximately 2 to 5 minutes. [8] X Research source It’s best to use filtered water for your tea because tap water can affect the taste of the tea. 8 to 10 ounces (237 to 296 ml) of water will make one to two servings of tea, so increase the amount of water if you are making tea for more people."

[9] X Research source You add the tea directly to the water and strain the leaves out later, or use a tea infuser, which is a small, thin, reusable bag that allows the leaves to steep into the water while keeping them separate. If you’re using a teapot, it likely has a compartment to place the leaves, so it’s easier to remove them later."
