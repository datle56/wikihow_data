      "content": "Find the spider that bit you, if possible. If you can, try to trap the spider that bite you to determine if it is a recluse spider. You can also try to remember the appearance of the spider that bite you. A recluse spider is tan all over, with legs attached to the upper part of its body. [2] X Research source You don't have to catch the spider. Even taking a picture of the spider with your phone can help the medical professionals to identify the spider and treat you. This spider gets its nickname, \"fiddleback\", because of the unique violin-shaped marking on the back of the upper body part. The lower body part doesn't have any markings. A recluse spider has three pairs of eyes across the violin-shaped marking, rather than the two rows of four eyes that most U.S. spiders have."

      "content": "Recognize the symptoms of a brown recluse bite. When you are first bitten, you may not feel anything. Within hours of the bite, you may feel mild burning or irritation in or around the bite wound. You may also have the following symptoms: [3] X Research source Severe swelling and pain at the bite site. A blister may develop that is blue in the center and ringed by redness, like a bull’s eye. The blister may then burst, and the area will enlarge into an ulcer that extends deep into the tissue. A pimple-like lesion with yellow or green pus. A rash around the bite site that itches. Your urine may appear dark in color. You may also experience fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, seizures, or joint pain. Like other spider bites, a recluse (fiddleback) spider bite will leave a small red mark. Unlike other spider bites, soon after the bite, a small white blister will appear and the tissue around the bite will become hard. The bite will then turn into a lesion that is blue-gray or blue-white, with ragged edges surrounded by redness. If left untreated, the skin around the recluse spider bite can become gangrenous, and develop into a large open wound. [4] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Wrap a compression bandage above the bite to reduce pain and swelling. If you do not have an actual compression bandage, tying any cloth above the bite site can slow down the spread of the venom. Raise the arm, hand, leg or foot with the bite above your heart by propping it up on a pillow. Make sure the bandage is snug, but is not cutting off your circulation."
