      "content": "Cut out the traced hole using a craft knife. Plunge the craft knife into the apple along the traced line, cutting a round hole. Cut about 1\" down (2.54 cm) to create a hole deep enough to hold the candle."

      "content": "Scoop out center area with a spoon. The pre-cut X shapes should lift easily. Then continue to hollow out the apple with your spoon. Scrape around the sides of the pre-cut hole to create a smooth center and base to hold your tealight."

      "title": "Drop the tealight candle into the hole.",
      "content": "Drop the tealight candle into the hole. Light a wax tealight candle after adding it. If using battery operated candles though, be sure to turn on the candle before dropping it into the hole."

      "title": "Decide how you will use the apple tealight candle holders.",
      "content": "Decide how you will use the apple tealight candle holders. For a fall theme, you could fill a large tub with water and fill it with lit floating apples. A large, Golden Delicious apple perched upon a small saucer placed as a centerpiece on each table might be a great way to celebrate your child’s teacher at the next teacher's luncheon. A tall cylindrical vase filled 3/4 full with water would be beautiful with a floating apple candle holder on top! Also, the water could be colored to compliment the apple or a theme of choice."
