      "content": "Think about why you have a crush on this person. When you’re deciding whether to share your feelings with your crush, take some time to be honest with yourself about why you like them . If you and your crush like a lot of the same things, you always have fun when you spend time together, and you have the same values in life (like getting good grades or spending time with your family), you might be a good fit together! [1] X Research source If you don’t know your crush very well, you might just be infatuated by their physical appearance or the way they present themselves. If that’s the case, you can sometimes build up an image of them in your head that they can’t live up to, which isn’t the best basis for a healthy relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 715 wikiHow readers who've told their crush they like them, and 55% of them agreed that their goal in doing so is to see if there’s a chance for a romantic relationship. [Take Poll] When deciding whether you should confess your feelings, think about whether you can see yourself in a relationship with them or not."

      "content": "Spend one-on-one time if you need to get to know your crush better. Instead of just admiring your crush from afar—or rushing into a full confession of your feelings—see if you can come up with a way to spend time around them. That way, you can get to know their character better, and you’ll give them a chance to get to know you, too. This will help you decide whether you should tell them about your crush. In some cases, it might even make you realize you like the person better as a friend! [2] X Research source If you go to school with your crush, try spending time together by sitting together at lunch, asking for help with a school project, and spending time around their friends. You can also invite your crush to hang out with you and your friends when you get together. If your crush drives and you don’t, ask them if they can give you a ride so you can spend time together!"

      "content": "Watch for signs that your crush likes you , too. If someone likes you, they’ll usually pay a lot of attention to you when you’re around. They might spend time looking at you, or they might always laugh at your jokes, even if they aren’t that funny. These can all be signs that your crush likes you, and you should probably tell them how you feel. [3] X Research source You might also notice that your crush remembers little details about you, seems reluctant to say goodbye or leave when you’re around, or finds reasons to brush their hand against yours. Keep in mind that relationships aren’t an exact science. Sometimes, a person might act that way and not mean anything by it."

      "content": "Don’t let fear hold you back. It can be really tempting to avoid putting yourself out there because you’re afraid of being rejected. However, if you’ve taken the time to think about why you like this person and you’re convinced they’re right for you, and you think that there’s a possibility they might like you back, just go for it! Even if you put yourself out there and they say no, you can tell yourself that you were brave and bold, and you should be proud of yourself for trying."

If you’ve tried spending time getting to know them, but they don’t seem to be sending back the same signals, take a step back and consider whether they’re really the best match for you. [4] X Research source You should probably move on if the other person doesn’t respond to your texts, they seem disinterested or annoyed when you’re talking, or if they tease you in a mean-spirited way. Also, they’re probably not interested if they talk about other love interests in front of you. Avoid approaching a crush who is already in a relationship, as this is just likely to cause unpleasant drama. [5] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 September 2019."

The longer you wait, the harder it will be, and the more you’re likely to overthink it. [6] X Research source Even if your crush says no, telling them sooner will give you a chance to move on more quickly. If they say yes, you can move on to your relationship faster! If you’re having trouble working up the courage to tell them, set a deadline for yourself and write it on your calendar. [7] X Research source"

Even if your crush likes you back, it can come as a big emotional surprise to hear that you have feelings for them. If the person you’re like is already dealing with a lot, that can be an overwhelming conversation to have. Before you confess your feelings, ask your crush how they’re doing. If it sounds like they’re stressed out or exhausted, it’s probably better to wait for another day. [8] X Research source For instance, if you know your crush has a big presentation coming up, they’re starting a new job, they’re not feeling well, or they were up late studying, be considerate and give them a little space."

To avoid that, try to find a time when the two of you can have a private conversation. Either invite them to meet you somewhere, ask them to walk with you, or approach them when they’re on their own. [9] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 September 2019. [10] X Research source If you’re both hanging out in a big group, for instance, you might say something like, “Hey Jess, I’m going to grab a drink and I wanted to talk to you for a sec. Wanna come?” By keeping it casual, you can help put them at ease. You could also text your crush with something like, “Wait for me after your last class and I’ll walk you home.” That way, you’ll have some time to talk, but you’re not springing your feelings on them during their school day."

If having a face-to-face conversation seems nerve-wracking, you might want to consider calling or texting your crush. Get your crush's number , then send them a text asking if they have a minute to talk. If they're free, give them a call or send them a straightforward text letting them know your feelings. [12] X Research source This can help take some of the pressure off of the other person, too, since they won't have to come up with an answer right away. The same rules apply to a phone call or text conversation as an in-person chat. Try to make sure you have the other person's undivided attention, and avoid telling them how you feel while they're feeling stressed out or tired."

That could lead to a really drawn out, awkward experience for both of you if they don’t share your feelings. Also, make sure you plan to give your crush a little space to think about things before answering. [15] X Research source For instance, it’s probably not a good idea to tell someone you like them at the beginning of a long car ride, since neither of you will have the option of walking away if things feel uncomfortable."
