      "content": "The hime cut is long in the back, with fringe and face-framing side pieces. Often seen on anime characters and K-pop stars, the hime cut (姫カット) is a combination of the Amasogi (center-part) and Binsogi (chin-length bangs) styles. It features blunt bangs and face-framing side pieces, with the remaining hair worn long and straight. This creates a cool, edgy, and eye-catching cut that looks both elegant and mysterious. [1] X Research source The word “hime” translates to “princess” in Japanese, and it is pronounced “hee-meh.” If you’re into the Korean wolf cut or octopus cut, the hime cut could be a great option for you! [2] X Research source 1970s Japanese pop star Megumi Asaoka is known for popularizing this look, but since 2021, TikTok has led to a resurgence of the style worldwide. [3] X Research source Celebs like Bae Suzy, Lee Da Hee, Lisa from Blackpink, Haerin from New Jeans, Momo from Twice, Chisa from XG, and the Haim sisters have sported this cut."

      "content": "The hime cut originates from the Japanese Heian period (794-11185 CE). During this time, noblewomen grew out their hair to extreme lengths, before chopping off the front pieces at the age of 16. Their fathers or brothers usually cut their hair while chanting \"Chihiro, chihiro\" (which translates to \"very long\"). This hair-cutting ritual was part of a traditional ceremony called Binsogi, which celebrated their coming of age. [4] X Research source After the ceremony, women were allowed to cut their hair over their forehead, cheek, or shoulder, and many trimmed it with the goal of adding glamour to their appearance."

      "content": "Create a center part and section off a triangle of hair at the roots. Brush your hair so it is tangle free, then part your hair in the middle using the tip of a rattail comb . Place the tip of the comb about 2 inches (5.08 cm) behind your hairline, in the center of your head, and draw a downward diagonal line from the center point of your head to the tail of your eyebrow. Repeat this step on the other side to form a triangular section of hair. [5] X Research source This section of hair will become your bangs, so be sure the sides of the triangle align with the edges of your eyebrow (while looking straight ahead). [6] X Research source If it doesn't, re-part your hair in the center and try again. Then, pin the rest of your hair back with creaseless hair clips to keep it out of your face. Skip this step if you already have bangs, or trim your existing bangs with sharp hair-cutting scissors . If you decide to trim your hair, spritz some water onto your bangs so they lie flat on your forehead."

      "content": "Hold the section of hair between 2 fingers and pick your bang length. Use your non-dominant hand to hold the section of hair taut between your fingers, then fold your hair over to see how your bangs look at different lengths. Most people like their bangs to hit right below their eyebrow for the classic hime look, while others prefer a shorter length that still exposes their eyebrows. [7] X Research source If you want to shorten the look of your face, opt for longer bangs that extend past the bottom of your eyebrow. If you want to lengthen the look of your face, opt for shorter bangs that hit the top of your eyebrow or barely graze the bottom of your eyebrow."

      "content": "Make a horizontal cut across the section of hair to create blunt bangs . While holding your hair taut between your fingers, snip straight across with a pair of hair-cutting scissors, following the line of your fingers to ensure both sides are even. Snip below your fingers so you don’t cut off too much hair by accident, and leave your bangs at least 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) longer than you want them to be. [8] X Research source Continue cutting in 0.25 inch (0.64 cm) increments until you reach your desired length. Once you achieve your desired length, make small snips at the tips of your bangs if you want a more natural look."

Remove the creaseless clips holding your hair back, and place the tip of a rattail comb at the starting point of your bangs. Draw a downward diagonal line from that point to your temple, then pull the new section of hair forward to separate it from the rest of your hair. Repeat this step on the other side, and pin the remaining hair away from your face. [9] X Research source If you have thick hair, section off less hair on each side of your bangs so your side pieces don't look too heavy. If you have thin hair, section off more hair so they look more proportional to your face and bangs. [10] X Research source"

Use short, quick snips to cut your hair (below the comb) in a downward direction, making sure the hair closer to your chin is longer than the hair closer to your ear. Continue cutting in 0.25 (0.64 cm) increments until you’re satisfied with the length, then repeat on the other side to finish your hime cut! [11] X Research source If you have a long or oval-shaped face, cut your side pieces closer to the middle or top of your cheeks to shorten your face. [12] X Research source If you have a short or round face shape, leave your side pieces closer to your jawline or the bottom of your lips to lengthen your face. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Straighten your hair to achieve the sleek and classic look. For the traditional hime look, wash your hair with a smoothing shampoo and conditioner before gently drying it with a towel. Apply a heat protectant spray over your strands, avoiding the scalp area, and blow-dry your hair to pre-straighten it. Use a round brush to shape your bangs first since they dry the quickest, then straighten your hair when it’s dry. Finish off with a shine serum to minimize frizz and achieve glossy, pin-straight strands."

If you want the shorter layers of your hime cut to truly frame your face, use a curling iron to curl the ends of each side piece inward. Focus on twisting the tips of each piece in an upward direction to mimic the curve of your jawline, and leave the rest of your hair straight and sleek. If you don’t have a curling iron, you can achieve the same effect with a flat iron . Be sure to apply a heat protectant spray anytime you curl, straighten, or blow-dry your hair."

Wash your hair with a curl-defining shampoo and conditioner to maintain moisture, then apply a styling mousse to enhance your ringlets. Blow-dry your hair with a diffuser to add volume to your bangs and side pieces, and once your hair is dry, go back with a curling iron to redefine any loose sections. [14] X Research source Since the hime cut requires lots of heat styling, apply a moisturizing hair mask 1-2 times a week to hydrate your strands and minimize heat damage."

      "content": "The hime cut can be altered to suit any face shape. Since the hime cut is quite sharp and angular, it’s especially flattering on round-shaped faces because it adds structure. However, it can be tweaked to complement anyone’s face shape, plus shorten or lengthen their facial features. Once you determine your face shape and decide to make the cut, play around with the length of your bangs and side pieces to see what looks best on you!"

      "content": "The hime cut requires lots of upkeep if you have curly or textured hair. Because the traditional hime cut consists of pin-straight hair, achieving the sleek look will be much more challenging for people with wavy, curly, or textured hair—compared to those with naturally straight hair. To maintain the look, you will need to regularly style your hair with a flat iron or curling iron, trim your bangs and side pieces, and use nourishing hair care products to minimize heat damage. [15] X Research source If you have naturally straight hair, the classic hime look will be fairly easy to maintain—all you need to do is trim your hair every few weeks to keep your bang and side pieces polished."
