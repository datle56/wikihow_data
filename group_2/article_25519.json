      "title": "It might take a few weeks, but this could happen if you go no contact.",
      "content": "It might take a few weeks, but this could happen if you go no contact. Your ex will probably sit back and think, “Hmm… I haven’t heard from them in a while.” When they realize that you’re not trying to reach out at all, they’ll get worried, and maybe even a little confused. They’ll probably try sending you a text or even giving you a call, just to see how you’re doing. [1] X Research source This is a good sign, but don’t give in yet! It’s important to hold off on responding to anything your ex says or does until the no contact period is up."

      "title": "This is a subtle way of reaching out to you.",
      "content": "This is a subtle way of reaching out to you. If you post a cute pic on Instagram, they’ll be one of the first people to like it. If you update your Facebook status, they’ll probably react to it. Since they haven’t heard from you in a while, they’ll probably stalk your social media accounts just to learn a little more about what you’re up to. [2] X Research source They might also try to DM you on social media if they haven’t been able to get ahold of you via text."

      "title": "They might not mention you directly, but they may talk about how tough it’s been.",
      "content": "They might not mention you directly, but they may talk about how tough it’s been. It could be something vague about how they’re wishing you well, or even something about how sad they are. Chances are, when they post about the breakup online, they’re doing it so that you’ll see it (and reach out to them about it). [3] X Research source Again, the key here is to not respond to it in any way (don’t even give it a like)."

    {
      "title": "They’ll probably just “happen” to be in the neighborhood.",
      "content": "They’ll probably just “happen” to be in the neighborhood. Maybe your ex knows you always get drinks on Fridays at a certain bar, or they know you play golf on Saturdays at the golf range. When they show up, they’re definitely looking for you, even if they have an excuse. [4] X Research source If this happens, be polite and say hello, but don’t give them much of an interaction. You can ask them how they’ve been or share what you’ve been up to, but don’t dive deep into the relationship, and keep the conversation short."

      "title": "Your friends may tell you that your ex has been asking around.",
      "content": "Your friends may tell you that your ex has been asking around. Your ex might say that they’re just concerned for you or worried about you, but really, they’re trying to get an update on you. Ask your friends to only share a few things (not everything) to leave your ex wanting more. [5] X Research source If you and your ex were together for a long time, they might even reach out to your family members to ask about you."

      "content": "When you’ve ignored them for a while, they might start to get mad. If the messages they’re sending you change from sweet to angry, you’ll know that the no contact rule is really working. When they still can’t get ahold of you, they’ll probably realize that you’re not going to come around, and they’ll get sad about what they’ve lost. [6] X Research source If the messages get too much to handle, don’t be afraid to block them, at least for a little while."

      "content": "They may do this if they’re getting desperate to talk to you. If you start getting little gifts in the mail, you’ll know that the no contact rule is working to your advantage—your ex wants to talk to you so bad that they’re trying to buy your love. It could be something small, like a bouquet of flowers, or even something big, like concert tickets to your favorite band. [7] X Research source These gifts might come with a note, like “I’m sorry,” or, “Can we just talk?”"

Once the no contact rule is over (you can set this period yourself, but usually it’s around 30 days), it’s up to you whether or not you want to reach out to your ex.
