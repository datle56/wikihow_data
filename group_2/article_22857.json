      "content": "Make sure you have the right display cable for your TV. The Xbox 360 comes with a display cable, but you'll need to make sure your TV or monitor has the correct ports. If you're using an older TV and only have an HDMI cable, you'll have to purchase a cable or adapter that converts HDMI to the type of connection your TV does have. Here are the different possible cables that may have come with your Xbox 360: [1] X Research source HDMI cable: This cable looks the same on both sides. If your TV or monitor has a port that fits the plug (it will usually be labeled \"HDMI\"), you can use a standard HDMI cable to connect the unit. Component HD A/V cable: This cable has HDMI plug on one end (which goes into the Xbox), and 6 colored A/V plugs on the other. Check the back of your TV or monitor to see if it has component ports that match the colors on the A/V plugs. If it's a standard (non-HD) TV, you'll use only the red, white, and yellow connectors. VGA HD A/V cable: If your TV or monitor has a VGA port, you can use an HDMI-to-VGA cable to connect your Xbox 360. This cable doesn't come with Xboxes too often but can be purchased separately. Composite A/V cable: If your TV or monitor has composite ports (usually red, white, and/or yellow), you can use an HDMI-to-Composite cable. This cable doesn't support HDMI, but it does come with a lot of Xbox 360s."
