      "content": "Flip the drinking glass over and mount the LED. Already having applied glue to the light itself, all you need to do is use a small amount of pressure to make sure the glue sticks.

      "title": "Slide the crystal ball onto the glass.",
      "content": "Slide the crystal ball onto the glass. Insert the drinking glass and its attached LEDs into the opening of the glass globe until it comes to rest against the dried glue bead. The opening of the drinking glass will now be the base of your crystal ball, which should be glowing from the LED tea lights inside. If your drinking glass is too small, it will slip all the way into your globe and spoil the effect of a raised, glowing crystal ball. If you are using a canning jar simply screw the lid into place. The LED tea light will now be hanging on the inside of the jar, surrounded spiderweb cotton."
