Don't kiss and tell. We know — it's very easy to do. That doesn't mean it's right. What goes on between you and your crush is between you and your crush. Try not to gossip too much about it. Don't kiss when you are sick and likely to spread germs. Kissing is a very intimate thing, but that doesn't mean that your kissing partner wants every single part of you, including your cold. Try not to kiss when you are feeling under the weather. Kiss one person, not everyone. Kissing may be fun, but that doesn't mean that it sends the right message to go out and kiss everyone you want. Focus on one person you really like, try things out, and then move on to someone else if that doesn't work out. You'll be appreciated a lot more, and you'll probably be happier."
