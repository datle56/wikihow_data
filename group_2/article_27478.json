      "content": "Get some money. Unfortunately, \"making it rain money\" doesn't mean calling on the rain gods to summon dollar bills from the clouds. You'll need to get your hands on the greenbacks yourself. So find a job, help out your neighbors, and cash those checks. Go to the bank and ask for $1 bills. The more bills you have, the better. You want a veritable downpour, not a drizzle. While you're at the bank, check to make sure the stacks of $1 bills (or $20s, if that's how you roll) don't stick together. Sometimes fresh bills, all crisp and hot off the presses, adhere to each other. If this is the case, ask for rain-able bills. The teller, if they've any sense, won't ask any questions."

      "content": "Hold the money in one hand in an orderly stacked pile. You'll be holding the money in your non-dominant hand and making it rain with the other. Make sure you have a firm grasp on the entire stack so none of it gets away from you. Only hold as much money in your palm as you can handle. If it goes too far above your fingertips, things could get unruly (or someone could run off with your cash). Keep the rest of your stacks nearby; any break in the rain and the effect just won't be the same."

      "content": "Peel the money off in a motion that resembles an \"I'll stay\" signal in blackjack. You know, where you place your four fingertips on top of the top bill and brush it away from you. That \"I'll stay\" signal sort of a resembles a \"no more\" hand gesture, but only gesturing forward. Try to go as quickly as possible at a speed you can maintain evenly. Move your hand holding the pile to the left and right, making it rain all around you. Walk around, leaving a trail of rain wherever you go."

      "content": "Maintain a carefree and arrogant countenance while making it rain. When Kanye makes it rain, no one bats an eye. If Honey Boo Boo were trying to make it rain, a few eyebrows would be raised (okay, maybe not). But the sentiment remains the same: act like this is just your normal Tuesday afternoon and the ground being rained on by you isn't worthy of your footsteps, much less your cheddar.

      "title": "Use a fan.",
      "content": "Use a fan. You know what can blow money all around a room and keep it flowing way more effectively than your own bare hands? A giant fan. Set it on a high level with enough room in front of it to add your stacks o' cash. Turn it to the on position when it's not plugged in. That way, when you go to plug it in, you're in front of it when it turns on, ready to get rained on and rained on and rained on as your dead presidents swirl through the air."

      "content": "Make it rain over people. Sure, you could make it rain by yourself. You could run around your room, spreading the dough, raining on your bed as part of your nighttime routine, and then go to sleep comfortably on your piles and piles of simoleons. Or -- OR -- you could take your stacks and liven up any party, a coffee date with a friend, or dinnertime with your parents. Think of the endless possibilities! You'll probably want to coordinate together beforehand. Springing it on them could result in them diving for your cash or thinking you're a money-grubbing materialist. And who knows? Maybe they'll want to make it rain with you -- talk about a flood of money!"

If a helicopter isn't readily available, find a high point you can drop it from. The rooftop, the Eiffel Tower, a mountain -- just be ready to make the news! For the record, with this, you won't be getting your bucks back. The wind can be a cruel, cruel mistress."

      "content": "Think of it as charity. Who says you have to make it rain in the comfort of your own home or outside in nature? Walk into your local Starbucks and get to precipitating! Or skip the Starbucks where everyone can afford $4 lattes and make it rain at your local homeless shelter or, well, Walmart. What better way to get active in your community? And then watch as people look around at each other, wondering who's going to make the first pounce. How long do you think it'll take? At first everyone will be convinced it's fake -- what happens when the first person realizes that you're making it rain certifiable ducats?"

Just know that if you do choose to make it rain at your local Burger King, you'll probably have some pretty stiff competition when it comes to recollecting your change. Finders keepers, losers weepers, you know? So maybe you should stick to your living room, bathtub, or at most, backyard. How much risk are you willing to take? If you're getting authentic with it, you'll want to pick it back up as discreetly as possible. And be careful with it! Crumply dollar bills don't roll off your stack as nicely as crisper ones. When you pick it all back up, smooth them out for reuse."
