    {
      "title": "Bring 4-6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.",
      "content": "Bring 4-6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. The water should be at least 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) below the rim of the pot. Set the stove burner to medium-high for best results. Add a pinch of salt to the water. You need plenty of water in the pot to give the macaroni enough room to cook and expand. If you don't have enough water, the macaroni will get lumped together and won't cook nearly as well."

    {
      "title": "Stir in the macaroni after the water reaches a boil.",
      "content": "Stir in the macaroni after the water reaches a boil. Pour in the macaroni and stir it around to keep it from sticking. Cook the pasta for about 8 minutes, or until it's al dente -- that is, tender, but still chewy, and definitely not mushy. Try a piece with a fork (carefully) in order to see if it's ready before turning off the stove. Stir every 1-2 minutes to desired taste or until tender. Just make sure to check the instructions on the box of pasta you are using, because some types of pasta take longer to cook than others."

      "title": "In a separate, large saucepan, heat oil and butter over medium heat.",

When the butter has melted into the oil, add flour and mix it well with a whisk (a fork or slotted spoon will also work). Continue to gently stir this mixture for about three minutes, or until it's smooth and begins to turn light brown. This is the beginning of the sauce you will use over the cooked macaroni. You can also begin to make the sauce while the noodles are cooking to save time."
