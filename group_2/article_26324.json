      "content": "If you have traditional braces, think about the color bands you will choose. Avoid clear bands, since they tend to stain.

[2] X Research source Try to experiment with different colors. You'll get to know after some time which colors look best on you. If you're going to do two colors or more, make sure that they do not clash with each other."

      "content": "Considering asking for another style of braces. If you really do not like the traditional braces that you've been given, ask your orthodontist about other types of braces. Some of your options include: Ceramic Braces: they are the same size as the traditional ones, except they are colored to look like your teeth. [3] X Research source Lingual Braces: they are located on the inside of the teeth so they won't be visible. Be aware that they tend to be more uncomfortable at first, and they may hurt more. [4] X Research source Invisalign: this is not a type of braces. They are custom-made mouth guards that will align your teeth over a period of two years or more. They don't work for serious dental issues."
