      "title": "Get the fish glove and equip it.",
      "content": "Get the fish glove and equip it. The fish glove is another badge-required glove that’s obtainable in Slap Battles; for this one, you’ll need to use the ZZZZZZZ glove (which costs 70 slaps) and stay under its effects for 1 hour straight in a single life—without being woken up by anyone else. Furthermore, you can’t get the glove on a private server; it has to be public. [1] X Research source The easiest way to get your hands on the fish glove is to get onto a smaller public server and find a remote hiding spot that’s hard for other players to find. That way, you’re more likely to get through the whole hour without being disturbed!"

      "title": "Go to the Normal Arena with the fish glove equipped.",
      "content": "Go to the Normal Arena with the fish glove equipped. Once you have the fish glove, head through the red portal in the Lobby—and you’ll find yourself in the Normal Arena! It’s an area with several different islands, plus a spinning plate (known as “The Plate”) that floats around the arena endlessly. [2] X Research source When you go to the Normal Arena, keep in mind that you’ll also need a friend with the Cloud glove to come with you. Cloud is a slap-costing glove; it costs a hefty 28,000 slaps to obtain."

    {
      "title": "Have a friend use their Cloud glove.",
      "content": "Have a friend use their Cloud glove. The Cloud glove’s ability involves summoning a fluffy white cloud that allows up to two players to fly around, one as the driver and the other as the passenger. Aboard the cloud as either the passenger or driver (it doesn’t matter which), fly up to the cloud’s height limit—as far up as it’ll go in the Normal Arena. [3] X Research source You can also be the one with the Cloud glove for this, but you’ll still need a friend to tag along. Just use the Cloud glove’s ability and give the summoned cloud to your friend (so it won’t despawn). After that, you can quickly reset and equip the fish glove, go back to your friend, and get onto the cloud together as usual."

    {
      "title": "Use the fish glove to land on The Plate from the height limit.",
      "content": "Use the fish glove to land on The Plate from the height limit. When you reach the cloud’s height limit, use the fish glove’s “flop” ability, which will fling you (dealing 50 knockback) in whatever direction you’re trying to go. Use the flop ability to land right on The Plate (which moves around the arena continually). [4] X Research source After landing on The Plate, you’ll be granted the Leap of Faith badge and schlob glove immediately. Congratulations!"

      "content": "Retry the leap as many times as you need to land on The Plate. You may not get a perfect landing on the first try—and that’s okay! As long as you have the time, keep at it; after a few tries, you should be able to complete your leap from a cloud to The Plate and earn yourself the Leap of Faith badge (and, of course, the schlob glove).

      "title": "The schlob glove has an ability called “Out Rags Your Doll.”",
      "content": "The schlob glove has an ability called “Out Rags Your Doll.” This ability is a simple one: it lets you keep control when you get rag-dolled (which is what happens whenever you get slapped). Usually, getting rag-dolled means getting thrown back and going limp for a short time; with the schlob glove, you can move and even build up high speeds while rag-dolled instead. [6] X Research source Schlob power: 51 Schlob speed: 17 Required badge: Leap of Faith Description: Solid yellow with a crash dummy symbol across the palm"

    {
      "title": "Pros",
      "content": "Pros The schlob glove is great for helping you survive slaps and combos; you can even use it to travel where you need to go after getting hit by an ability that forces you to ragdoll for a long time. You can also use schlob’s passive to find a safer position if you’re too close to a dangerous area (so you don’t have to worry about suddenly dying as much). [7] X Research source High knockback gloves that schlob can help you survive include God’s Hand, Berserk, Sparky, bus, Kinetic, Jebaited, Rhythm, and Dice. You can also use schlob to work around the abilities of gloves such as Scythe , woah , Moai . With schlob equipped, you can even use glove attacks from Brick , Alchemist, and Santa to your advantage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons The main drawback of the schlob glove is its lack of offensive abilities; you can’t really use it to deal high levels of damage to other players or resist insta-kill gloves like OVERKILL, The Flex, or Error. Furthermore, gloves with a short knockback (like Speedrun ) make schlob’s special ability redundant. [8] X Research source Schlob is easily countered by gloves like Ice, brazil, and Frost God since they don’t cause rag-dolling. It can also be hard to control your movement while rag-dolling with the schlob glove since it causes you to gain speed rapidly."

      "title": "Can you get schlob with the Killerfish glove?",
      "content": "Can you get schlob with the Killerfish glove? No, you can’t—don’t mistake the “fish” glove for the “Killerfish” glove! Killerfish is an admin glove. Its ability is similar to fish, but you don’t use it to get the schlob glove; you must use fish."

      "title": "Can you get the schlob glove in a private server?",
      "content": "Can you get the schlob glove in a private server? Yes, you can! If you’re more comfortable in a private server with only a friend around, you can definitely do that."

      "title": "What else was added alongside the schlob glove update?",
      "content": "What else was added alongside the schlob glove update? The schlob glove and several other updates were added to Slap Battles on June 7, 2024. Most notably, the Jester glove was rebalanced, and its special ability’s cooldown increased from 5 to 8 seconds; Jester’s insta-kill chances were also lowered from 10% to 5%. The Dive Bomb glove was also rebalanced, with its cooldown starting after landing (lasting 12 seconds). Finally, fixes were applied to the Reaper, Warp, Fish, Killerfish, and Titan gloves.

      "content": "What is the easiest glove to get in Slap Battles? There’s no definitive easiest glove in the game, but players tend to agree that gloves like Acrobat, Spin, Plague, and Dual are super easy to get (in addition to Default, which you start the game with)."

    {
      "title": "What is the rarest glove in Slap Battles?",
      "content": "What is the rarest glove in Slap Battles? Again, the “rarest glove” is more a matter of player opinion—and generally, players tend to agree that gloves like Spy, Head Hunter, Dive Bomb, Detonator, bob, and Necromancer are among the rarest and hardest to get in the game."

      "title": "How can you get the Siphon glove in Slap Battles?",
      "content": "How can you get the Siphon glove in Slap Battles? To get the Siphon glove, a Siphon user must use its ability to throw a device into the Cube of Death (which charges the cube). Wait for the cube to spawn a blue orb, and collect that orb to get the Caution: High Voltage badge and Siphon glove. You’ll also need 5,000 slaps to earn the badge. [10] X Research source"
