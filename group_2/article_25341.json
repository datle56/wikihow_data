      "content": "Determine if you have persistent gender dysphoria . Gender dysphoria is a persistent feeling of distress caused by a mismatch between your gender identity and the biological sex you were assigned at birth. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Think about whether you feel a strong disconnect between your physical sex characteristics and what you feel to be your true gender identity, and especially whether you feel an intense desire to alter the appearance of your breasts. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For example, if you’re transitioning FTM/N, you may feel a strong desire to hide, bind, or remove your breasts. If you’re MTF, you might strongly wish that you had more prominent breasts and you might do things to enhance their appearance, like wearing padded bras. Many surgeons and insurance companies require that you have “persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria” before they will approve you for any kind of gender reassignment surgery, including top surgery. Talk to your doctor and your therapist (if you have one) about how you feel about your body and how long you’ve felt that way."

      "title": "Ask yourself how your dysphoria affects your quality of life.",
      "content": "Ask yourself how your dysphoria affects your quality of life. Living with gender dysphoria can be extraordinarily difficult. Think about whether the appearance of your chest causes you stress, anxiety, or depression. If so, you might be a good candidate for top surgery. It may be especially important to consider top surgery if other methods of managing your dysphoria, such as using a binder to flatten your chest or taking estrogen to enhance your breast size, aren’t working well for you. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try writing up a list of specific ways that you think your quality of life could be improved by top surgery. For example, you might include things like, “My self-esteem would be improved,” or “I wouldn’t have to deal with pain from my binder anymore.”"

      "title": "Try to have as strong of a support network as you can.",
      "content": "Try to have as strong of a support network as you can. If you’re considering having any kind of major surgical procedure, it’s important to have supportive people in your life. Think about whether you have friends or family to turn to who can provide both emotional and practical support while you’re preparing for and recovering from your top surgery. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If so, reach out to those people and have a conversation with them about what kind of help they’re willing and able to offer. For example, you might ask a family member if they can come with you to the hospital to be an advocate during your surgery and recovery, or find a friend who’s willing to be a supportive listener if you’re dealing with any anxiety or stress about the procedure. If you don’t have any supportive friends or family, ask your doctor or therapist to recommend a support group for transgender people or people experiencing gender dysphoria."

      "title": "Work with a therapist to manage any mental health issues.",
      "content": "Work with a therapist to manage any mental health issues. Undergoing top surgery is a deeply personal decision. It might help to talk to a therapist and consult with your primary care doctor to discuss your physical, mental, and emotional expectations. Doing so will help you cope with any stress related to the surgery, and will also make it easier for you to make informed decisions about your health. Ask your doctor to recommend a therapist if you’re not working with one already. Being transgender or having gender dysphoria does not mean you are mentally ill. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source However, transgender people often struggle with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety due to the unique challenges they face. [7] X Research source If you’re dealing with one of these conditions, remember that you are not alone and there are treatment options available to you. A therapist can help you set positive, realistic goals for your transition. They can also talk to you about what to expect emotionally from the surgery and recovery process, and how to cope with any related stress."

      "title": "Give yourself plenty of time to establish your gender identity before surgery.",
      "content": "Give yourself plenty of time to establish your gender identity before surgery. Top surgery is a major procedure that will permanently change your body. Once you discover that you have gender dysphoria, you should explore your gender expression and find as comfortable of a space as possible with regards to your gender identity. This will help you make the right surgical decisions. So, before you go through with it, give yourself time to think about whether it’s something you really want to do. Even if think you’re absolutely sure right now, if you can endure the dysphoria, do your best to explore your gender identity for 12 months and see how you feel at the end of that time. Some surgeons and insurance companies won’t approve the procedure until you’ve been living as the gender with which you identify for a full year, though this is more common for \"bottom\" (i.e. genitalia) surgery. If you’re struggling with severe gender dysphoria, waiting even a short time to make an important change like this can be very difficult. Work with your counselor, doctor, and any supportive friends and family you may have to help you cope and stay positive during that time."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you don’t know anyone, you may be able to meet someone you can talk to through a transgender support group in your area or an online community for trans people. Ask them questions like: “What do you wish someone had told you before you got your top surgery?” “What was your recovery like?” “Do you feel satisfied with how your surgery turned out?” “Were there any social problems or discrimination issues that you had to deal with after the surgery?”"

      "content": "Get an assessment from your mental health provider. Before you can get insurance approval for top surgery, you’ll probably need to get a letter from your therapist affirming that they feel you are a good candidate for the procedure. If insurance approval is the route you will take, and as you consider getting a consultation with a surgeon, sit down with a therapist and go over your goals, your feelings about the surgery, and any concerns you might have about the procedure. They can help you decide whether it’s a good time for you to go ahead, and, if so, they can write a letter to your surgeon on your behalf. This letter may include: Information about your dysphoria, including how long you have been experiencing it Details about any mental health conditions you have, and how they are being treated A discussion of whether you understand the risks and benefits of the procedure, and how top surgery is likely to improve your quality of life Information about your current support system"

      "content": "Consider external factors that might impact your surgery. Deciding when to have top surgery is a complex decision that's shaped by your feelings of dysphoria or discomfort associated with your chest. However, you may need to take other factors into account, like waiting to schedule your surgery until your fees and financing are secured. In addition, you need to be able to take time off work to facilitate your recovery, so that might impact your scheduling, as well. In some cases, your insurance provider may cover some or all of the costs of your procedure."
