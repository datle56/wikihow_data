      "title": "Assess your situation.",
      "content": "Assess your situation. Is there a legitimate reason that you feel like you may be fired? Look for evidence at the office that may suggest your job is in peril. If you can’t find any, then it’s likely that your fears are all in your head and you have nothing to worry about. Some signs that your employer might be preparing to let you go include: Your workload subsides. There’s new management that wants to take the company in a new direction. Your manager is suddenly avoiding you. You’re no longer asked to attend important meetings. Your boss is hyper-critical of your work."

      "content": "Put fear in its place. If you can’t find any concrete proof that your job is at risk, try to find the source of your fears. Your fears may be the result of past personal experiences. Identifying the cause of irrational fear can be the first step in mitigating it. Were you blindsided when you were let go from a former employer without notice? Did you watch a friend or family member go through a painful time after losing a job? Do you see being fired as a poor evaluation of your self-worth?"

      "content": "Talk to your peers. If you feel like your fear of being fired is reasonable, see how your co-workers feel about their own job security. You may be surprised to find out that many of them have the same worries you do. Some employers do use the fear of being fired in a misguided attempt to keep their employees in line. If you feel like your company is manipulating you, you may want to start searching for a new place to work. Don’t complain to your co-workers. It could get back to your boss."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your supervisor.",
      "content": "Talk to your supervisor. Politely ask your boss for a private meeting to discuss your concerns.

Your boss will likely be impressed by your initiative and may be able to put your mind at ease. Offer to take on extra projects that could lighten your boss’ work load. Realize the treatment from your boss is rarely personal. Your boss is likely focused on the big picture of your company growth rather than your performance. Bring in a list of your accomplishments at work."

      "title": "Get references.",
      "content": "Get references. Before you leave your job, make sure to get plenty of references that will help you secure a new job. You’ll need people to vouch for your work ethic.

    {
      "title": "Spend time getting to know yourself.",
      "content": "Spend time getting to know yourself. Clear your mind of the stress leftover from your job. If you do get fired, you’ll have plenty of time to focus on what makes you happy.

Rowling was fired from her day job as a secretary and was even homeless for a short period of time before writing the “Harry Potter” books. Michael Bloomberg was fired from an investment bank and used his severance package to start his financial data company. Bloomberg L.P. is now one of the most successful companies on the planet."

      "title": "Get your confidence back.",
      "content": "Get your confidence back. Having constant fear that you’ll be fired can be very detrimental to your self-esteem. When you’re out of that job, you’ll get a chance to remember how great of a person you really are. The only thing that changes when you get fired is your employment status. You’ll find that you’re still the same intelligent, capable person you were before you worked there and eventually another company will agree. [1] X Research source"
