      "title": "Do not rinse the rice before you cook it.",
      "content": "Do not rinse the rice before you cook it . Most people rinse rice for sanitary purposes, and to get rid of the starch dust. Starch is what causes rice to become sticky and clump together. If you cannot bear to eat rice without washing it, then rinse it once or twice—but don't rinse so much that the water runs clear. You still want some of that starch left."

      "content": "Consider letting the rice soak in a pot of water before you cook it. Some people find that letting the rice soak in water helps it become stickier in the end. Try soaking it for 30 minutes to 4 hours. Drain the water once the rice has finished soaking."

      "content": "Fill a large pot with 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water and add a few extra tablespoons of water. Using more water than you actually need will help make the ricer stickier and clumpier. Consider adding a dash of salt. This will give the rice some flavor and make it taste less bland."

Short-grain rice tends to have a higher starch content than medium or long-grain rice, which makes it slightly more sticky. Both jasmine and basmati are considered to be medium-grain."
