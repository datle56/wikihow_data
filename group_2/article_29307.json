      "content": "Leos can't stand someone else stealing the spotlight. The next time you’re watching a movie or series, make a comment about how handsome the lead actor is. Your Leo may not say anything out loud, but he'll immediately feel threatened and start measuring his own attractiveness against the actor’s. If he goes out of his way to point out the actor’s flaws, you know you’ve struck a nerve. You might say something like, “I’m binge watching The Witcher right now and I’m not going to lie—Henry Cavill looks incredible.” A jealous Leo might respond with something like, “There’s no way he’s that muscular in real life. It’s all lighting and camera work.” Avoid fawning over another guy's looks IRL since that might provoke or upset your Leo too much. Stick to complimenting famous actors or musicians."

      "content": "Telling a Leo you’re too busy to hang out will drive him mad. Leos want to be the center of attention at all times. Even if you give your man a reasonable excuse, he’s likely to feel rejected if you tell him you’re unavailable. He'll also wonder what you could possibly be doing that’s more important than spending time with him. [3] X Research source You can also try things like: Telling him you need to check your schedule when he asks you on a date. Being super vague about what your plans are after turning him down."

      "content": "Leos need attention and assume the worst if they don’t hear from you. Men born under this sign are possessive and usually want to be in contact at all times. They need to know what you’re up to! If you really want to make your man jealous, wait a few hours before answering his text. If he calls, let it go to voicemail every now and then. Avoid leaving him hanging for days, since he might get really worried or angry. He can handle a few hours of silence, though!"

      "content": "A Leo will be jealous of anyone who monopolizes your time. Plan an elaborate night out on the town with your best friends. Be sure to emphasize that your plans are strictly friends only so he’ll feel left out and envious. Remember to stay out late and have a blast! You can bet that your Leo will stalk your social media for \"clues” about what you’re up to, so chronicle your evening with plenty of Insta and Snapchat posts."

      "title": "Knowing you have another admirer will rile him up.",
      "content": "Knowing you have another admirer will rile him up. Your possessive Leo will get paranoid the minute he learns someone else has feelings for you. In his mind, this person is encroaching on his territory and he doesn’t like it one bit. This works especially well if your admirer is someone you have to see on a regular basis. Say something like: \"Rick from Accounting stopped by my office for a whole hour yesterday. His little crush on me is getting out of control.\" \"My Chem lab partner blushes every time I talk to him. It's kind of endearing, but I wish he would focus so we can get our assignments done!\""

      "content": "Your Leo will turn green with envy when he reads the comments. It really gets under a Leo’s skin when the object of his affection gets attention from others. Snap a few cute selfies and post them on Facebook or Instagram. He may not comment on your posts himself, but you can bet he’ll see your pictures and read every single comment. Leos are a bit paranoid, so your man will probably check out the profiles of your admirers and wonder how you know them. Avoid flirting with your admirers in the comments since that might push your Leo a little too far."

      "content": "For a Leo, the thought of you with someone else is intolerable. Lions tend to be territorial about everything—even your past. You don’t need to speak at length about your old flame; mentioning your ex briefly in a vague, offhand way is more likely to get your Leo’s imagination working overtime. Say something like: \"Oh, my ex-boyfriend drove a car like that. It was pretty cool.\" \"I saw that movie with my ex back in the day.\" \"My ex used to say the exact same thing!\""
