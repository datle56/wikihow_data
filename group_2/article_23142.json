Lots of people date and get married, lots of people date and date and date and never marry, lots of people date one person forever, and lots of people just don’t date at all. Although some folks (your parents, your teachers, the media, the church, Carrie Bradshaw) may have strong opinions on dating and relationships, at the end of the day, they’re just that: opinions. There’s no right or wrong way to do relationships, and whatever way works for you is your normal. It’s also fine and normal and healthy as heck to change your mind along the road (or not!). You may not want to date ever for various totally valid reasons, or you may just not feel like it right now, and eventually you’ll feel differently."

(It’s a very low-stakes example, but we stand by it.) [8] X Research source Sure, you still have to compromise with friends, family, coworkers, and other people you interact with regularly.

While romantic relationships can be extremely deep and rewarding and you’d be totally justified in wanting one now and then, remember that the magical soulmate-level intimacy of 2 people dating has been a little mythologized. Just a hair. In addition, loneliness doesn’t only exist to be solved by a romantic relationship. As Emerson wrote, “My giant goes with me wherever I go”—in other words, if you date because you’re lonely, you’re likely to still be lonely in the relationship. [9] X Research source"

There are lots of reasons why people might stay single longer (or always), and many of them are totally happy alone . Now that society is (slightly) more accepting than it used to be, many people are exploring different types of relationships, like asexual or aromantic relationships, and feel less pressure to commit to one partner, or any partner. One study found that the drop in sex and dating among younger people in recent decades may be linked to a rise in video game playing, a decrease in alcohol consumption, and declining earnings. [16] X Research source People, especially heterosexual women, have higher standards than they used to, and are less likely to commit to the wrong partner. Even among folks who do want to partner and maybe marry, singledom is preferable to being with the wrong person."
