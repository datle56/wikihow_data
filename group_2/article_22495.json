      "content": "Note any changes to your cat's diet, thirst or behavior. To determine why your cat is vomiting, think about changes to your cat's diet, thirst, and behavior. Start by remembering when and what your cat ate last. Note if your cat is drinking more or less than usual. Also, check the litter box to see how often it has been used and if the cat has diarrhea. For example, think about if your cat just ate a lot of wet food in a short period of time. Or consider if your cat hasn't been eating much and seems overly tired. Note that vomiting is a symptom rather than a diagnosis, and may indicate an underlying health problem. Cats can become dehydrated easily, so if the cat vomits several times in a few hours or vomits more than 1 day in a row, take the cat to see a veterinarian."

      "content": "Feed your cat smaller portions if you see undigested food in the vomit. If there's undigested food in the vomit and your cat seems fine once they've thrown up, the cat might have just eaten too quickly. To prevent your cat from vomiting again after it eats, slow the cat down. Offer it smaller portions of food more frequently and spread the food out so your cat has to look for the food. If you have more than 1 cat and can't slow it down when it eats, separate the cats when you feed them. This will let you feed them a smaller portion."

      "content": "Check the color and texture of the vomit. Take pictures of the vomit to show your vet. The color, texture, and quantity of the vomit can help the vet determine what is causing it. For example, if thereâ€™s blood in the vomit it may indicate damage tot he stomach lining, while yellow bile can indicate inflammation around the bile duct.

      "content": "Treat your cat for hairballs if you find clumps of fur in the vomit. It's normal for cats to vomit the occasional hairball even if you groom them regularly, but if your cat is vomiting hairballs every few days, give your cat a hairball medication. Purchase an over-the-counter medication and follow the manufacturer's directions. To use most cat hairball medications, rub the medication above your cat's lip so the cat licks it."

      "content": "Limit your cat's food intake if it's just had surgery. If your cat has had any type of surgery and vomits, don't feed it any more food for the day. Instead, offer lots of fresh water to prevent dehydration. Then give your cat a small portion of food the next morning. If your cat vomits again, contact the veterinarian. Your vet may give you the phone number to a postoperative care line that you can call if your cat keeps vomiting."

If you don't see anything unusual in the vomit and your cat hasn't had surgery, the cat might be experiencing separation anxiety. This is especially likely if your cat has been trying to get your attention in other ways such as urinating in inappropriate places, yowling, and destructive behavior. Try to spend at least 10 minutes a day cuddling with your cat.

For example, tell the vet if your cat is tired or lethargic. Your cat's behavior is a big indicator of how your cat's feeling. If your cat has health problems, you'll probably notice that your cat isn't acting as they usually do."

If your cat stops vomiting after this period of time, you can feed small portions of bland foods such as boiled chicken and rice. If your cat keeps vomiting, call the vet again to ask about giving your cat medication. Keep giving your cat lots of water, even when you're withholding food.
