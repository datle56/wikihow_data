They might avoid your presence, even joining after-school activities or staying with friends, because they feel safer around people who don't hit them. Your child may become less open and affectionate around you. They (or someone else) may call CPS or the police if they think the child is being abused. They may even start to fear you."

      "content": "Find a private area. Conducting this type of discipline in a private area preserves the dignity of your child and prevents unnecessary embarrassment. The focus should be on discipline, and additional embarrassment for your child should be minimized. Most experts are adamant that children should never be spanked under any circumstances. Nonetheless, some parents believe that spanking is the best way to get children to adhere to rules. Whatever your position is on spanking, it is clear that spanking has negative consequences. Therefore, this method of discipline should be used sparingly, as a last resort, and only to prevent your child from engaging in dangerous activities. Ensure that siblings and other children are not present during the spanking. If a spanking occurs in a public place, take your child to a private area away from onlookers."

      "content": "Explain to your child why they are being spanked. It is important that your child understands why they are being disciplined so that they learn what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Try to use all discipline, including spankings, as a teaching opportunity and not just punishment. Be sure to use clear age-appropriate language that your child understands when you explain the consequence. For example, you could say, \"Donnie, you were running through the house with the scissors and almost ran into your brother. I have already given you a warning about this behavior so now it is time for a spanking.\" Whenever possible, give your a child a warning before proceeding to spank. This will allow them the opportunity to adjust his behavior to avoid the spanking."

Objects should never be used to spank your child and you should limit spankings to approximately two to three pats on the backside. Never spank your child when you are angry. Any spankings should be done when you are calm. This will help you avoid unintentional injury."

It is very important everyone is on the same page with discipline so that your children are unable to split or divide parents and caretakers. You can include your children in making some of the rules. It’s important that children feel like they are a part of family decisions. However, don’t be afraid to be firm about the important issues. For example, if your teenager needs to be home by 11 pm don’t allow them to argue their way into a 2 am curfew. It is important to communicate your expectations regarding your child’s behavior with relatives, babysitters, and other caregivers outside of the home. If the caregiver is unable or unwilling to adhere to your behavioral expectations with your child, then you should consider putting your child in the care of someone whose parenting beliefs better align with yours."

Make sure that the rules are explained when your children are calm and be sure to use language that they can easily understand. Trying to explain your expectations when your child is upset or tired will not be helpful. You should be calm and well-rested when having this discussion as well. Make sure that the rules are concrete and specific so that there is no room for misinterpretation. For example, it’s better to tell your ten-year-old, “Be home by 7 pm” instead of “Be home before it gets dark.” Make sure that the rules are explained in advance. Try not to only discuss rules after one is broken. Instead, explain them in advance, even if it means repeating yourself. For instance, you could say, “We walk when we are at the pool” before arriving at the pool. Try to word rules in an affirmative manner. For instance, you would want to say, “We walk when we are at the pool” rather than “Don’t run while at the pool.” Explain the reasoning behind the rules you set in place. If your child or teenager understands why the rules exist in the first place, they will be much less likely to break them. For example, running at the pool can cause one to slip and get hurt, and waiting until after dinner to eat dessert ensures that your child is getting proper nutrition."

      "content": "Enforce the rules consistently. Be consistent with the rules so that your children can clearly understand them. If you only enforce rules sporadically then you will confuse your children. This confusion will make it difficult for them to clearly understand your expectations and boundaries. So, if the rule is that your child is home by 7 pm then when he calls and asks if he can stay at a friend’s house later, remind them that the rule is that he is home by 7 pm. If there was no rule formerly in place about a particular behavior when it occurs, then it’s important to take time to establish the rule and clearly articulate it after the undesirable behavior occurs."

      "content": "Avoid arguments with your children about the rules. No, this does not mean to give in to their every whim. Instead, it means to avoid going getting into no-win arguments with your child. If you have made the rules clear and he is still trying to argue his way into submission, it’s okay to stop the conversation. The rule is still valid but you have removed yourself from the argument. For example, if your preteen is screaming, “It’s not fair, Ben gets to stay outside until 10 pm” you can just respond by saying, “I know he does.” Or maybe your teenager is still beating the drum about using the car to go out on a school night; you could say “What did I say?” or “I said no” without additional discussion. This approach should only be used after you’ve already explained the rules to your child and they are still trying to get their way. It minimizes the power struggle and helps to make it clear that the rule stands."

      "title": "Reinforce positive behavior.",
      "content": "Reinforce positive behavior. Decide what behaviors you want to see more of in your child and reward that behavior. Your child is not born knowing what they should or should not do. As their parent, it’s up to you to train them and mold their behavior. Therefore, it’s essential for you to identify what behaviors you want your child to develop and reinforce them. Rewarding positive behavior with positive consequences is more effective than implementing negative consequences for misbehavior. Rewards for positive behavior should be consistent with the actual behavior. Verbal praise works well for most positive behavior whereas larger rewards should be reserved for more significant milestones. For example, straight As on a report card may warrant a celebratory dinner out. You could also use a token system to reinforce positive behavior. A token system is when your child can earn points or small tokens for appropriate behavior throughout the week. At the end of the week, they can trade in the tokens or cash in the points for a larger reward."

      "title": "Ignore annoying behaviors or habits that are not harmful to your child or others.",
      "content": "Ignore annoying behaviors or habits that are not harmful to your child or others. Instead, respond to them when they are demonstrating the behavior that you want to see and you will see more of that. When you take away the attention from the negative behavior, they no longer have an audience. Often this process will reduce the undesirable behavior and increase desirable behavior. For example, if you want your child to stop throwing tantrums, do not respond to them when they begin to demonstrate tantrums. Instead, wait until they are calm and is engaging in appropriate behavior before you respond to their requests. The tip above does not apply to meltdowns, which are caused by an unmet need rather than a denied want. If your child is having a meltdown, you should aim to solve the cause of it rather than ignore your child's distress. Only ignore behavior that poses no harm to your child or other people."

      "title": "Identify the reason for any misbehavior.",
      "content": "Identify the reason for any misbehavior. There will be times when your child acts out. Most acting out behavior is normal and developmentally appropriate. If you can figure out why your child is misbehaving, then you may be able to prevent future misconduct. Keep in mind that there are generally four reasons that a child may misbehave: to feel a sense of power, because he feels inadequate, to get attention, or to get revenge. If your child is acting out because they feel powerless, you may give them other age-appropriate opportunities to assert power. For example, they could start having more choice about what to wear to school or what to have for breakfast. If your child is struggling with feelings of inadequacy, you can help them identify their strengths and allow them to participate in activities that they do well in to build confidence. Attention-seeking behavior can be easily remedied by giving your child plenty of attention and praise when they are engaged in appropriate behavior. If you give them a lot of attention before they act out, this will decrease negative attention-seeking outbursts. If your child is seeking revenge, it is important to sit down and have an age-appropriate conversation about how to better manage their anger. For example, you could say, “I know that you are upset and I’m sorry that your brother made you mad. However, it is not okay to punch anyone. Instead, please use your words and come talk to me or Dad about it.”"

      "title": "Decide if a natural consequence is appropriate.",
      "content": "Decide if a natural consequence is appropriate. A natural consequence is the natural result of a child’s own behavior. These consequences are purely the result of their actions and are not inflicted upon them by the parent. For example, the natural consequence that occurs when your child does not put their dirty uniform into the hamper is that their uniform is dirty on game day. If the natural consequence is appropriate, then allow your child to experience that consequence. Sometimes they are the best teachers. Natural consequences should only be used if the child is not in danger of being harmed. For example, you would not want to allow your toddler to touch a hot stove. The natural consequence would be that your child is burned and that is never appropriate. After the natural consequence occurs, be sure to have a conversation with your child about why it happened. For example, you could say \"Sam, you did not put your clothes in the hamper so now your uniform is not clean for today's game.\""

      "title": "Decide on a logical consequence.",
      "content": "Decide on a logical consequence. If a natural consequence is not appropriate, then implementing a logical consequence is the next step. A logical consequence occurs as a result of a child’s behavior, however, a parent or caregiver imposes it. The most effective logical consequences should be related to behavior. Also, the consequence should not be overly punitive nor should it be so minor that the child is unaffected. Here’s a good example of a logical consequence: if you find that you keep telling your child not to lay their bike in the driveway then you could say, “Sam, when your bike is lying in the driveway, it prevents me from being able to pull into the yard after work. If I do not see it, I may accidentally run over it. The next time that I see your bike lying in the driveway, I will be putting it in the garage and you will not be able to ride on it for 2 days.” This is better than using a consequence that is unrelated to the behavior such as “You cannot watch TV for two days;” overly punitive such as “You can’t go to your friend’s house for a month;” or too minimal such as “You will have to come outside and move it when I beep the horn.” Always use respect and avoid being judgmental when utilizing consequences. For example, it is better to say, “I know that you are excited about going on the trip with your friend. However, your room must be clean before you go. If the room is not clean then you will not be allowed to go;” rather than saying “You are so sloppy and I’m not your maid. Clean this room immediately or you’re not going anywhere.” Allowing your child to help choose the consequence can be helpful. For example, you could say, “You were running in the house and broke the mirror. How are you going to replace it?” Or you could say “Sam, if you are going outside then you have to wear your play shoes. If you want to keep on your school shoes then you have to stay inside. The choice is up to you.”"

An ideal timeout area is a quiet place that is free from distractions such as television, toys, and other children. It might be helpful to have a predesignated timeout space in your home or other places that you visit frequently. This way you can avoid the added frustration of trying to figure out a good timeout spot. Be sure that you tell your child why they are being taken to timeout. And be sure to criticize the behavior and not the child. For example, you might say, “It is not okay to hit Alex” rather than saying “You are a bad boy for hitting Alex.”"

So, your three-year-old would be in timeout for three minutes, your four-year-old would be in timeout for four minutes, etc. Your child may resist staying in timeout and this is completely developmentally appropriate for a preschooler. If they refuse to stay put, firmly but gently hold them down by their shoulders. You may also try placing them on your lap and securely holding them there while they remain in timeout. Some parents prefer to take a timeout away from their child instead of when the child is resisting. This could simply mean telling your child that you are taking a timeout from them and then staying in the same room to monitor them but not responding to them."
