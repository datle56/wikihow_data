      "title": "Opt for solar panels if your property gets at least 4 hours per day.",
      "content": "Opt for solar panels if your property gets at least 4 hours per day. Peak sunlight hours occur when the sun is the highest in the sky, and locations closer to the Equator get more peak sun hours than those further away. Look online for a peak sunlight hours map to see how many peak hours your area has. Then, check your property for places that aren’t covered by shade during the day, since solar panels can’t generate electricity if they aren’t exposed to sunlight. [1] X Research source Look for solar power companies near you and schedule a consultation. Solar power companies can look at your home and property to determine how efficient solar panels would be. [2] X Expert Source Guy Gabay Solar Energy Contractor Expert Interview. 4 August 2020. Solar power companies will examine the slope of your roof and the direction that it faces, whether it's north, south, east, or west. These are all variables that will determine how much energy that solar panels could theoretically produce for your home.

      "content": "Choose a type of solar panel that works best for you. It’s important to choose the right solar panels for your home. The 3 main types of solar panels are monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin film. Monocrystalline panels are the most recognizable types and have about 20% efficiency. They take up the least amount of space, but they are the most expensive. Polycrystalline panels are more affordable, but they only have about 16% efficiency and don’t work well in higher temperatures since they have a low heat tolerance. Thin film panels are flexible and the cheapest option, but they are the least efficient at 7-13% and they take up the most space. [4] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source See if there are any financing options for the solar panels so you can pay them off over a set period of time rather than spending a lot up-front. You can install single solar panels at a time if you can’t afford to buy multiple panels. Sometimes, electric companies offer certain rebates or incentives if you install solar panels. Contact your electric provider and ask them if they offer grants or discounts for solar panel installation."

      "content": "Install a mounting system and an inverter to convert electricity. Once you have your solar panels picked out, you can install the mounting system on your roof or on the ground. Then, attach inverters to the panels to convert the electricity and power your home. [5] X Research source If you don’t feel comfortable installing the solar panels yourself, many solar power companies will install the panels for you.

      "content": "Expect to spend between $15,000 and $20,000 for solar panels. The cost of your solar panels will depend on the size of your property and how much wattage it takes to power your home. On average, though, you can expect to spend around $20,000 upfront. [8] X Research source You may be able to work out a payment plan with either the solar panel company or your electric company, so look into your options before paying in full. Any extra electricity you generate can usually be sold back to your electric company, so you may be able to make some extra money over time."

      "title": "Check the zoning restrictions in your area for the maximum structure height.",
      "content": "Check the zoning restrictions in your area for the maximum structure height. Since wind systems are tall, you may not be able to install the system in a residential area depending on your zoning requirements. Check with local building inspectors or your city’s homeowner’s association to see if you’re eligible for building a turbine. If zoning isn’t an issue, then you can build a turbine on your property. Many zoning ordinances have a height limit of about 35 feet (11 m), and many wind systems need to be 30 feet (9.1 m) higher than the tallest structure within 500 feet (150 m)."

      "title": "Opt for a turbine if the average wind speed is 14 mph (23 km/h) or more.",
      "content": "Opt for a turbine if the average wind speed is 14 mph (23 km/h) or more. Look online for wind speed maps or airport wind speed data to see what the average wind speed is in your area. If the average wind speeds are around 14 miles per hour (23 km/h), then a turbine might be an efficient way to generate electricity to power your home. If the wind speed is slower, then you may not get the turbine’s full effectiveness. Wind speeds increase the higher above ground you are. Many airports measure their wind speed from about 30 feet (9.1 m) above ground, which is similar to the height of a residential turbine. Hire a professional who installs wind turbines to check the efficiency and wind speed of your property for you if you have trouble determining it yourself."

      "title": "Calculate the minimum diameter for the turbine blades to power your home.",
      "content": "Calculate the minimum diameter for the turbine blades to power your home. Check with your electric company to find out how many kilowatt-hours your home used in the past year. Use the formula AEO = (0.01328)D 2 V 3 , where AEO is your annual energy output in kilowatt-hours per year, D is the diameter of the rotor in feet, and V is the annual average wind speed in miles per hour. Solve the formula for D and buy a turbine system with the correct size rotors. For example, if you use 11,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and the average annual wind speed is 20 miles per hour, your formula would be 11,000 = (0.01328)D 2 (15) 3 . If you solve for D, the diameter you need for your system is about 10 feet (3.0 m). Once you know what size turbine you need, purchase one from a local supplier. This company may also be able to supply you with other crucial parts (like the tower) and/or complete the installation. You can also find wind turbines online."

      "content": "Opt for biomass or biogas if your property produces a lot of waste. When we say “waste,” we’re not talking about garbage: for biomass, things like wood chips, timber offcuts, paper products, old crops, sewage, and animal manure are ideal. Biogas is useful if you’re on a farm that produces a lot of animal waste. [10] X Research source Burning these waste materials creates methane and carbon dioxide, which can be used for heating, cooling, and cooking. While methane and carbon dioxide are both greenhouse gasses, burning the methane in a biogas system is better than releasing it into the atmosphere. Typically, it’s more efficient to burn biomass than it is to compost it."

To use the methane and carbon dioxide that these waste materials produce, look into a biomass or biogas system for your property. Typically, biomass and biogas systems are partially underground. They collect the waste and then burn the off-gas to generate power. The size and installation process depends a lot on the size of your land and where it is, so it’s best to have a professional come take a look and give you an estimate. [11] X Research source"

In order to see if your stream is right for a micro-hydro system, hire someone from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , or the U.S. Department of Agriculture to come and take a look at your property. They will measure the “head” (the vertical distance that the water falls) and the “flow” (the quantity of water falling).

You will also need to look into your water rights (who owns the stream that is on your property) and whether or not you can disrupt it with a micro-hydro system. [14] X Research source Each state controls their own water rights, and they can vary from state to state. You will also need to factor in the environmental impact of your micro-hydro system. If you have any native species on your property, for instance, that would be impacted by a micro-hydro system, it may not be feasible."
