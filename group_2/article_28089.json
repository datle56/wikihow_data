[1] X Expert Source Quynh La Professional Baker Expert Interview. 11 March 2022. You need a high concentration of yeast to leaven your bread, so you have to get a colony going before you can start baking. Any glass or plastic container with a lid will work for a sourdough starter. Canning jars are excellent, as are empty pickle or jam jars. Be sure the jar is clean, so the started doesn't get contaminated."

Mix equal parts flour and water in a separate bowl (the amounts aren't important, as long as you mix enough to fill your jar most of the way). Stir until thoroughly blended. Pour the mixture into your starter jar, leaving just a little room for air. Any type of flour will do, but remember that you need a good amount of gluten for your bread to rise properly (wheat, barley, and rye contain gluten)."

There will be plenty of yeast in your mixture already, as they are present in the air and in the flour. Yeast like 4 things in order to reproduce: warmth, darkness, water, and starch or sugar. You have now provided all of those things, so your yeast should begin to reproduce rapidly. Leave the jar (with the lid on) alone for 24 hours. Room temperature is usually warm enough to provide the right conditions for yeast to grow. If your house is on the colder side, place the jar in a warm part of the kitchen. Cover the yeast jar with a heavy cloth to keep it dark."

[4] X Expert Source Quynh La Professional Baker Expert Interview. 11 March 2022. Within a week, your starter will develop a bubbly froth and a pronounced sour smell. When this happens, your starter is done, and you are ready to bake."

Your yeast will stay alive in the cold, but they will remain in a state of sluggish dormancy.

      "content": "Proof your sponge. To do this, pour the entire starter into a mixing bowl and add equal parts flour and water to it, stirring to combine. The total amount of water you add should not exceed the amount of water called for in your bread recipe. 1 cup (236 ml) is a good amount for a loaf of bread. Cover the bowl with a towel, and let the yeast propagate for several hours. This process is called \"proofing.\" The resulting slurry is called a \"sponge.\""

Add a pinch or 2 of salt, and then gradually stir in flour until the dough holds together but is still sticky. Flour varies in absorbency, so using exact measurements isn't nearly as useful as relying on your judgment. You can mix the dough together easily using nothing but your hands and the mixing bowl."

When your dough has doubled in volume, it's ready for the next step. [6] X Research source Dough rises faster when it's in a warm, dry place. If your kitchen is cool, turn on the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, tilt the door open a few inches, and place the bowl inside while the dough rises. You can let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight."

Add flour when necessary to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands. [7] X Research source The dough should begin to look glossy and smooth. Keep punching the dough until the consistency looks right. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment instead of your hands."
