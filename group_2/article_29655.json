You need more fabric to make a pleated skirt than you would to make a non-pleated skirt because of the folds. To make your pleated skirt, you will need: Fabric in the color and type of your choice. Cotton and wool make good pleats, while lighter fabrics like silk and satin do not. Keep in mind that you will need a piece of fabric that is long enough to fit around your waist three times, so you may want to measure the fabric while you are in the store. This amount will provide plenty of room to make the pleats for your skirt. [1] X Research source Chalk Scissors Measuring tape Sewing machine Thread A 7” (18 cm) zipper. [2] X Research source"

It should also be 2” (5 cm) longer than you want the finished skirt to be. For example, if your waist measurement was 30” (76 cm) and you want the skirt to be 35” (89 cm) long, then you would need your fabric to be 90” (229 cm) wide and 37” (94 cm) long.

[5] X Research source However, it is important for all of your pleats to be the same size, so decide on a width before you begin folding. Keep in mind that the wider your pleats are, the fewer pleats you will have. If you want a lot of pleats in your skirt, then opt for a smaller width.

[10] X Research source If you used triple your waist measurement for the fabric, then it is highly unlikely that the measurement will be too small.
