Check with your city, state, and county’s wildlife departments and their departments of environmental conservation. They’ll outline whether you’re allowed to kill a raccoon or not. You can typically find this info online, but call each department individually if you can’t find the info. [1] X Research source In some cities, states, and counties, there are no protections for raccoons. You really have to check to see what your local laws are, though. There are normally laws surrounding the catching of raccoons; depending on where you live, you may not be allowed to trap it, let alone kill it. [2] X Expert Source Hussam Bin Break Pest Control Professional Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. This is not an empty warning—people can, and have, been fined and sent to jail for killing raccoons where it’s illegal. [3] X Research source"

If you live in a place where raccoons are protected but a raccoon is trying to get into your attic or ripping off siding, check to see if there is a lethal exemption in cases of property damage. Many jurisdictions have exceptions to their wildlife protection laws if the raccoon is actively damaging your property. [4] X Research source If you live in an area where this is the case, don’t kill the raccoon if it isn’t in the process of disturbing your home or vehicle. Depending on where you live, you may need a special “nuisance permit” to kill a raccoon that’s damaging your property. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply for a hunting or trapping license if necessary. It might sound silly to you, but you may need to apply for a hunting or trapping permit/license if you live in an area where raccoons are considered game. Raccoons are fur-bearing animals, and hunters often track and kill raccoons to harvest their pelts. Contact your local wildlife department to submit an application for a hunting license to kill raccoons if a permit is required where you live. [6] X Research source If you’re wondering, “Do I really need a hunting license to kill a raccoon that’s hanging out in my backyard?” If you live in an area where you need a permit to hunt raccoons, the answer is probably “yes.” A protected animal is a protected animal, and it may not matter where the animal is in proximity to your home depending on where you live."

      "content": "Trap the raccoon in a humane live trap before killing it. If you really want to kill the raccoon and you’re legally free to do so, you must trap it first. [7] X Research source Purchase a one-way, no-kill trap that’s large enough to hold a raccoon and set it up in the area where the racoon was last spotted. Check the trap every 24 hours—if you catch anything other than a raccoon, you’ll have to let it go. In most states, you are legally obligated to check live traps at least once every 24 or 48 hours. [8] X Research source If you aren’t sure about your state, assume you have to check it every 24 hours just to be safe. You are not allowed to release raccoons once you catch them in most jurisdictions. If you catch it, you must kill it.

Get a small game air gun designed for hunting (you can use a standard gun if you’re licensed and it’s legal where you live, but you might scare the neighbors). Once you catch the raccoon, aim carefully at the raccoon’s head, wait for it to stop moving, and drive a round through its head. [10] X Research source You typically do not need a permit for air guns, but look your local laws up just to be sure.

For one, they may not kill the raccoon instantly and you could end up seriously causing the animal a prolonged period of pain. Also, there’s a chance that you accidentally kill or maim a squirrel, cat, dog, or some other animal.

Even if they aren’t illegal where you live, you normally need a special permit to purchase and set up one of these traps.

Setting poison out for a raccoon may feel like an intuitively humane way to go about dealing with a raccoon, but it’s not. Any raccoon poison on the market will cause prolonged suffering for the animal. On top of that, there’s no way to ensure that some other wildlife doesn’t get to the poison as well. [17] X Research source It is also illegal in most jurisdictions to leave animal poison out in the open for any wildlife to get at. Animal control departments will use lethal injections and CO2 chambers to euthanize a raccoon, but you don’t have access to any of those methods. The over-the-counter poison you can buy is not nearly as fast-acting or potent as the industrial-strength stuff."

If you see any odd behavior or the racoon is foaming at the mouth and/or mangey, animal control will handle it for you. [22] X Research source Rabies is the main concern since a rabid animal can transfer the disease to pets or people. If a raccoon has rabies, it may act lethargic, aggressive, confused, or unusually friendly. It may also have discharge coming from its eyes or mouth, or have matted fur on their face.

Raccoons are attracted to outdoor pet bowls—especially if you leave food out all day for an outdoor cat or dog. Always feed your pets inside if you can. If you do need to keep garbage cans outside, consider leaving an inexpensive radio on inside of the can (you can tape it to the lid). Alternatively, you can install a motion-sensor light outside just above your trash cans. If you have a swimming pool, cover it when you aren’t using it. Raccoons tend to be attracted to open water.
