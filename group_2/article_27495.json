      "title": "Stir the clear glue, water, and baking soda in a large bowl.",
      "content": "Stir the clear glue, water, and baking soda in a large bowl. Ensure that you use a bowl that will hold at least 3 cups (720 mL) of liquid. Add 1 cup (240 mL) of clear glue, 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water, and 1 tsp (1 g) of baking soda to the bowl. Stir to combine the ingredients. [1] X Research source You can use a fork or a spoon to stir the liquid. Make sure there are no clumps of baking soda after you finish stirring."

      "title": "Add a few drops of food coloring if desired.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of food coloring if desired. You can keep your slime clear, or add a few drops of the food coloring of your choice to dye it. Stir to combine the food coloring with the glue, water, and baking soda. Try adding just 2 to 3 drops for lightly tinted slime, or add 7 to 8 drops for a darker, more saturated color. [2] X Research source For example, you could add 2 drops of green food coloring for slime that is tinted green and still easy to see through, or go with 8 drops for dark green slime that is only slightly transparent. Make sure to consider the color you want to dye your cubes. Choose colors that match or complement each other, such as yellow slime with yellow cubes or pink slime with purple cubes."

      "content": "Mix in 1 tbsp (15 mL) of contact lens solution. Contact lens solution contains borax, which activates the other ingredients and turns them into slime. Add the contact lens solution and then stir the ingredients together. Keep stirring until the slime starts to come away from the sides of the bowl. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Knead to finish mixing the slime.",
      "content": "Knead to finish mixing the slime. Once the slime starts to take shape, continue mixing it with your hands. Grasp the slime with your hands and knead it until you are happy with the consistency. [4] X Research source If the slime feels a bit sticky, add another 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of contact lens solution to the slime and knead it in. This will help to reduce the stickiness."

      "title": "Cut a magic eraser into 1 in (2.5 cm) or smaller cubes.",
      "content": "Cut a magic eraser into 1 in (2.5 cm) or smaller cubes. A magic eraser is a special type of sponge that has a stiff, crunchy texture to it. These sponge cubes are what give jelly cube slime its signature crunchy, squishy texture. Use a sharp pair of scissors or a sharp, non-serrated knife to cut the sponge into cubes. [5] X Research source If youâ€™re using a knife to cut the sponge, do it on a cutting board rather than over your counter or a plate. You can try using a regular sponge if you prefer, but the slime will end up with a different texture since regular sponges are not stiff and crunchy like magic eraser sponges."

      "title": "Add a few drops of food coloring to 2 cups (480 mL) of warm water.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of food coloring to 2 cups (480 mL) of warm water. After your cubes are cut, pour the water into a large bowl and stir in 3 to 4 drops of food coloring. Use a bowl that can hold at least 3 cups (720 mL) of liquid to make sure there will be enough room for the cubes. [6] X Research source You can use any color you like to dye the cubes! Try making blue cubes with blue food coloring, or mix 2 colors together, such as 2 red and 2 yellow to make orange cubes."

      "title": "Place the cubes into the dye and stir to coat them.",
      "content": "Place the cubes into the dye and stir to coat them. Use a spoon to stir the cubes around in the dye and sure that they are all submerged. If needed, add another 1/2 cup (120 mL) of water to the bowl to raise the liquid level, then stir the cubes around in the dye. [7] X Research source You can add another drop or 2 of dye as well, just try not to add it directly to any of the cubes or you might end up with a couple that look different from the rest."

      "title": "Leave the cubes to soak for 30 minutes or longer.",
      "content": "Leave the cubes to soak for 30 minutes or longer. It will take about 30 minutes to dye the cubes well, but you may leave them in for longer if desired. The longer you leave them in, the better the dye will set in. You can even leave them in the dye overnight if desired. [8] X Research source If you only want your cubes to be lightly dyed, take them out sooner, such as after 15 minutes."

    {
      "title": "Drain the excess water from the cubes.",
      "content": "Drain the excess water from the cubes. After you soak the cubes in the dye for the desired amount of time, pour them into a colander over a sink. Hold them over the sink for a few minutes to drain the excess liquid. Shake the colander gently over the sink to get as much liquid out of the cubes as possible. [9] X Research source Be careful not to shake the colander too much or the cubes may fall out."

      "title": "Squeeze the excess water out and let the cubes dry for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Squeeze the excess water out and let the cubes dry for 1 hour. Grasp a handful of the cubes and squeeze them over the sink to get even more water out of them. Then, place the cubes onto a dry paper towel after you squeeze them. Repeat this for all of the cubes. Let them sit and dry out for 1 hour. [10] X Research source The cubes should feel dry to the touch when time is up."

      "content": "Knead the cubes into the slime. After the slime is ready and the cubes are dry, dump the cubes into the bowl of slime and knead them in. Squish and fold the slime with your hands to distribute the cubes evenly. [11] X Research source Your jelly cube slime is now ready! Have fun playing with it!"
