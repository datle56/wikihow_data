      "content": "Set up a grooming station. Place a sturdy table that is at least 48 inches long in an open space, like a garage or a driveway. Like more dogs, Huskies tend to fidget when they are groomed, so the extra length of the table keeps them from sliding off. You can also put the Husky on a counter top or workshop table in your garage if you don't have access to a 48 inch long table. Attach a neck loop to a pole on one side of the table. You can tie a stripe of cloth or soft fabric to the pole to make the neck loop. If you can find a neck loop with an adjustable arm (available at most pet stores), this is a better option as you can adjust the neck loop so your Husky can relax her head as you groom her. Never adjust the neck loop so high that your husky is forced to hold his head up. Attach another pole to the opposite end of the table. Then, attach a longer neck loop or a white rope to the pole. This will serve as a hip loop to keep your Husky still as you groom them. If you have someone else who can assist you as you groom and hold your Husky still at the hips, you may not need a hip loop attachment."

Point the blower nozzle or the blow dryer head straight into her coat, so you can see skin in the center. If the hair looks like a smooth flat circle all the way around, with no fuzziness to the hair, you don’t need to blow dry your dog’s coat anymore as there is no extra hair in her undercoat to remove. If there are any fuzzy or clumpy areas on your dog’s coat, you will need to blow them out. Hold the undercoat rake in one hand and the blower in the other hand. Point the blower or hair dryer at the skin and bring the rake to the bottom half of the circle it creates. The visible bit of skin will be the center of the circle. Groom downward, with a light grip. Brush lightly, and don’t pull or tug at the hair. Avoid grooming in one spot for too long. Move around your dog’s body and work on different spots. With this method, you should be able to groom a full coat in less than an hour. The blower helps you to get directly to the undercoat and brush it well. Once you have finished blowing your dog’s hair, you should be able to back comb or back brush her hair smoothly and easily. You should also be able to run your fingers through your dog’s coat and not feel any unevenness or lumps."

Though your Husky may appear hot during the summer in her thick coat, never shave or over groom them. Her coat is designed to keep her cool in the summer. Her undercoat insulates her and her top coat provides protection from harmful UV rays, so it should never be cut short."
