      "content": "Select a healthy, semi-hard stem that grew in the current year. Look for a stem that’s green and sprouting leaves. It should also still be flexible. [1] X Research source It’s okay to take more than 1 cutting from the plant, as long as you don’t cut away more than one-third of the plant. Taking more cuttings from your jasmine increases your chances of successfully growing a new plant."

      "content": "Use small pruning shears to cut 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of stem. It’s best to cut the stem just below a leaf. The stem is more likely to sprout healthy roots if you cut right below a leaf node. [2] X Research source A leaf node is the nub that the leaf grows from. You can also use a sharp knife or pair of sharp scissors."

      "title": "Remove the leaves from the bottom of the cutting.",
      "content": "Remove the leaves from the bottom of the cutting. Make sure that you don’t plant any leaves beneath the surface of your potting soil. However, the cutting is more likely to root if the top few leaves are left on the stem. [3] X Research source Leave a few leaves at the top of the cutting while removing most of the leaves from the bottom. You can cut the leaves off the stem or pluck them with your fingers. Removing most of the leaves helps to balance the growth between roots and leaves."

      "content": "Deadhead any flowers from the cutting. This helps to ensure that your cutting will grow healthier. Flowers naturally try to seed and will take nutrients from the rest of the plant to do so. Additionally, dying flowers will mold, damaging the rest of the cutting. [4] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source You can cut the flowers off or pinch them off. Don’t take cuttings from stems that are in bloom. Even if a flower is cut off, it will still be in the bloom stage."

Make sure that you pour the rooting hormone into a clean container before dipping, then discard the used solution.
