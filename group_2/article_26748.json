      "title": "Choose, cut, and reinforce your strap material.",
      "content": "Choose, cut, and reinforce your strap material. You can purchase strap material for your bag, such as canvas, leather, or denim. You can also make your own strap material out of the same fabric you used for your bag, if you made the bag yourself. To make your own strap material out of fabric, cut a piece of fabric to about 1.5 times the desired maximum length and double the desired width of your strap. Then, iron fusible interfacing onto the inside of the strap to fortify it. Sew a straight stitch along the raw edges of the strap with the wrong (inner) sides facing out, and then invert the strap. [1] X Research source Fusible interfacing is available at craft supply stores. It is a type of fabric that you can iron onto the inside of an item to reinforce it, making it stiffer and stronger."

      "title": "Cut your strap into one long and one short strap piece.",
      "content": "Cut your strap into one long and one short strap piece. Cut the strap you just sewed into two pieces: one that is about 3 in (7.6 cm) longer than your desired maximum length, and a second strap that is about 6 in (15 cm) long. [2] X Research source For example, if you want to be able to adjust your strap up to 20 in (51 cm) long, then cut a long strap piece that is 23 in (58 cm)."

      "title": "Fold the short piece around the metal rectangle.",
      "content": "Fold the short piece around the metal rectangle. Take 1 end of the short strap and thread it through the opening in the metal rectangle so that it is about halfway through. Then, fold the end of the strap over so that it is even with the other end of the strap. [3] X Research source It is okay if the ends of the strap are raw. They will be hidden on the inside of the bag. However, you may fold the ends of the strap under before you sew if you want to hide the raw edges."

      "title": "Sew the ends of the short piece to the inside of the bag.",
      "content": "Sew the ends of the short piece to the inside of the bag. Press the 2 ends of the strap to the inside of the bag on the side. Form a loop with the 2 pieces so that the ends overlap the edge of the bag by about 0.5 in (1.3 cm). Then, sew a straight stitch about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the raw edges. Sew across the strap 2 to 3 times to ensure that it is secure. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sew the end of the long piece to the other end of the bag.",
      "content": "Sew the end of the long piece to the other end of the bag. Press 1 end of the long strap against the inside of the other side of the bag. Position the strap so that the end overlaps the edge of the bag by 0.5 in (1.3 cm). Sew a straight stitch about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the raw edge of the strap. [5] X Research source You may want to sew across the strap more than once to ensure that it is securely attached. If you want the strap to be detachable, then you may want to sew clips to the ends of it instead of sewing the strap directly to the bag. This is only advisable if the bag already has metal rings on it that you could attach them to, or if you are going to sew those metal rings on yourself."

Take the other end of the long strap and insert it into the slider on 1 side, then bring it up and over the bar and back down through on the other side of the slider. Move the slider about 1/3 of the way down the strap. Then, insert the end of the strap through the metal rectangle attached to the other side of the bag and pull it through by about 6 in (15 cm).

After you bring the strap through the metal rectangle, bring the end of the strap back over the bar and through the opening in the slider again so that the end is about 1 in (2.5 cm) past the edge of the slider. [7] X Research source Donâ€™t pull the end of the strap too far past the slider. You only need a little space to secure it."
