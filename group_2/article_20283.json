      "content": "Do cardio exercise 3 to 4 days per week. Cardio keeps your weight stable while providing muscle toning. Remember that it is impossible to target fat loss in one area of the body; cardio helps you burn fat all over your body. You can, however, target muscle growth. Move on to the hip and butt sections to learn how to do this. Choose cardio exercise routines that you enjoy doing. These routines will already be motivating, so you'll be more likely to maintain an exercise program with one included.
