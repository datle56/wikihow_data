      "title": "Light enters the greenhouse and is absorbed by plants and other objects.",
      "content": "Light enters the greenhouse and is absorbed by plants and other objects. The roof and walls of a greenhouse are made of glass or transparent plastic sheeting that allows sunlight to shine through. The plants you're growing in the greenhouse, as well as any other objects, absorb the light energy. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Plants and other objects convert absorbed light to heat.",
      "content": "Plants and other objects convert absorbed light to heat. When you stand outside on a sunny day, you can feel the light of the sun warming your body. The same principle is at work in a greenhouse—the sun's rays are absorbed by the plants and other objects inside, which convert that light energy to heat. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Plants and other objects slowly release the energy they've absorbed.",
      "content": "Plants and other objects slowly release the energy they've absorbed. When anything is heated by the light of the sun, it takes a long time for it to cool down again—just think about how warm it is inside your car if you leave it parked in the sun. As the plants and other objects in your greenhouse slowly release heat, they continuously warm the air around them. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "The heat is trapped in the greenhouse, keeping it warm inside.",
      "content": "The heat is trapped in the greenhouse, keeping it warm inside. Because heat energy has a different wavelength than light energy, it can't get through the glass or plastic barrier as easily as it came in. Some heat does escape, so greenhouses do need an alternative heating source in cold months—especially at night. But for the most part, the trapped heat keeps the greenhouse pretty warm. [4] X Research source Ventilation is necessary in a greenhouse to circulate the air and bring in fresh carbon dioxide, which the plants need, from outside."

      "title": "Maintain a temperature between 60 and 86 °F (16 and 30 °C) year round.",
      "content": "Maintain a temperature between 60 and 86 °F (16 and 30 °C) year round. While specific plants grow best at various ranges (and you should tailor your temps to your specific plants' needs), most plants grow best in temperatures that range between 60 and 86 °F (16 and 30 °C). You never want your greenhouse to get below 60 °F (16 °C) or above 90 °F (32 °C). [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use space heaters if you live in a cold climate.",
      "content": "Use space heaters if you live in a cold climate. In the winter months, you'll likely have the opposite problem you did in the summer. Space heaters take over when there's less sunlight so you can maintain an optimum growing temperature. If you're not actually growing anything in the dead of winter, you don't have to worry about this. But it might still be an issue in early spring."

      "title": "Lay a brick floor to help keep your greenhouse warm at night.",
      "content": "Lay a brick floor to help keep your greenhouse warm at night. Bricks have a high thermal mass, which is a scientific way to say that they absorb a lot of light and convert it to heat, which they release very slowly. For this reason, bricks are an excellent flooring choice if you live in an area that's cold much of the year. [6] X Research source Brick benches or a brick wall add some aesthetic quality to your greenhouse as well as store energy to help keep your greenhouse warm."

    {
      "title": "Cover the roof with white sheets to limit light in hot climates.",
      "content": "Cover the roof with white sheets to limit light in hot climates. White reflects sunlight, so white or pale-colored sheets or curtains keep too much light from coming in. On really hot, sunny days, this will keep it from getting too hot in your greenhouse. Greenhouse supply companies offer paint you can use to coat the roof. This is a less attractive option because the paint is hard to remove in the fall and you'd have to repaint every year."

      "title": "Add fans if it's still too hot even with ventilation.",
      "content": "Add fans if it's still too hot even with ventilation. Ventilation fans are necessary to circulate the air and bring in fresh carbon dioxide from outside the greenhouse. They also cool the air a little, but their cooling effect likely isn't enough in the summer months. Additional fans will do the trick and are less expensive than a full-blown air-conditioning system. Experiment with combining different methods to keep your greenhouse at the temperature it needs to be."

      "title": "In the northern hemisphere, construct your greenhouse due south of another building.",
      "content": "In the northern hemisphere, construct your greenhouse due south of another building. If you live in the southern hemisphere, on the other hand, construct your greenhouse due north of another building. This ensures that your greenhouse will get a long duration of sun exposure in the morning and afternoon as the sun rises. And since the sun hits the greenhouse first, it's not blocked or shaded by other structures. [7] X Research source For example, if you live in the northern hemisphere, you might build your greenhouse in the backyard on the southern exposure of your house."

    {
      "title": "Point your greenhouse facing the equator for maximum direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Point your greenhouse facing the equator for maximum direct sunlight. In the northern hemisphere, this means you want your greenhouse facing south—north if you live in the southern hemisphere. If a due south or due north orientation won't work in your backyard, face your greenhouse toward the rising sun so it gets more sunlight in the morning than in the afternoon (since morning sunlight is better for plants!).

      "title": "Attach your greenhouse to another building if you live in a cold climate.",
      "content": "Attach your greenhouse to another building if you live in a cold climate. Your greenhouse will get some of the radiant heat from the other building, which will help keep it warm during the winter months. Attached greenhouses are also a lot simpler and less expensive to build and maintain than free-standing structures. [9] X Research source For example, you could build a small and simple lean-to greenhouse off the side of your house."

      "content": "Protect a free-standing greenhouse from the wind with a hedge or fence. Wind can do more damage to your greenhouse than anything else. In relatively flat, windy areas, a fence or hedgerow serves as a windbreak to keep strong gusts from damaging the structure. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your greenhouse under trees if you live in a hot climate.",
      "content": "Place your greenhouse under trees if you live in a hot climate. Deciduous trees provide plenty of shade in the summer to help keep your greenhouse from getting too hot. In the fall, they shed their leaves to allow for maximum sun exposure just when your greenhouse needs it the most."
