Even a walk is healthy and entertaining! If you don't have a ton of time to kill, just take a walk around your neighborhood. Make an effort to be observant -- how many things can you spot that you never noticed before? Think about all your senses -- what can you hear, see, smell, touch, and taste? You might discover something interesting. You can make a neighborhood hunt and see what things your neighborhood has that you perhaps didn't know about."

You definitely won't need a calculator. Even the ones who know each other will have their phones in hand and head down, playing Candy Crush, Words with Friends, or just pretending to be texting someone they like better. We've become a society that doesn't engage. Resist. You can do it! Consider caving and take pictures of people staring at their phones. It's hard being the only one with your hands not clutching some lit-up piece of plastic, isn't it? That way you're still making a statement...sort of."

You're already on Spotify and Pandora, right? Good. Now just make efforts to go outside your zone of aural comfort. Gems are just waiting to be found.

Then you'll just finish and have more time to kill. But if you're going to do it, you might as well use wikiHow's Solve a Rubik's Cube article.

Here are some examples: Balance your checkbook . If you are waiting for an appointment and your checkbook is handy, you may be able to pull it out and take a look at the check register, totaling up the deposits and debits, and making sure the entries are up to date. Update your daily planner. Many of these are on PDAs or other electronic devices, and old entries can be deleted to free up space from time to time. Clean out your cell phone's messages and old contacts. If you have a cell phone with a bunch of old contact information, or that stores a lot of recent calls, missed calls, and voice and text messages, this might be a good time to clear all of the useless stuff out. Organize your purse or wallet. Be careful that no one is observing you if you have a lot of cash or personal stuff that is pulled out; however, if there are few people around you, you may sort your credit cards, business cards, and other stuff to make things a bit easier to find when you need them."
