      "content": "Appreciate her. Married couples can get comfortable with each other. This makes them lose some of the intense connection that made them get married in the first place. To prevent this from happening to you, tell you wife every day how much you appreciate her. When she walks into a room, let her know that you know she is there. Give her a passionate kiss when you both wake up in the morning or she comes home from work. Let her know that you know she is there and still feel the connection between the two of you. Try to hug her as well. Hugging is a simple physical connection that conveys how much you love her and that you appreciate her being around."

      "content": "Tell her you love her. Something as simple as telling your wife you love her can make her happy. Everyday life can get crazy and small things like this can get lost in the shuffle. You may say it every day out of habit, but say it like you mean it. Look her in the eyes before you leave the house and tell her you love her. Let her know that you are saying it because you feel it and not out of habit. She knows deep down you love her but hearing you say it with conviction will make her feel it too. Pair this with an affectionate gesture, such as a hug, a kiss, or a caress. Keep it romantic but not sexual. You want her to feel that you still want to court her every day, just like you did before you were married. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Say thank you.",
      "content": "Say thank you. A marriage can sometimes suffer from conversations that go something like \"I did this, so you have to do that.\" Don't let your actions towards one another feel like they are payback for some other action. Instead, find time every day to tell your wife thank you for the things she does. Say it in the morning when she puts on the pot of coffee. Tell her thank you when she picks up the dry cleaning after work when you have a meeting. No matter what the occasion, let her know that you see what she does for you. Try to say it even when it's something simple. Tell her \"Thank you for being you.\" or \"Thank you for being the best wife a man could have.\" This lets her know it isn't just what she does for you that you are thankful for.

      "content": "Give her space. You were both single people before you got married. Just because you now share a life doesn't mean that you have to share every interest you both have with each other. Give her time to write all day in the den if she wants. Let her go to the gym by herself. Give her the space she needs to work on the interests that she has that are separate from you. She will appreciate the time to recharge and be happier for it. Don't take it personally when she wants to do something without you. Just because she wants to go to the bookstore alone doesn't mean that she doesn't love you. Encourage her to do the things she wants to do and do the same yourself. If you have happy as individuals, you will be happier as a couple. [4] X Research source"

Letting her know that her opinion matters and that you care enough about her to let her decide will make her happy. Don't grumble or act upset about what she chooses. That will just make her angry and make you seem like a spoiled sport."

You don't have to be a gifted writer, just tell her how you feel. Let her know the things about her that you love and how she makes you feel. Tell her that you can't imagine your life without her in it. Explain how you don't work right without her in your life. Keep it simple by telling her how her laugh is the best sound in the world or how much you love the way her hair tickles you at night when you sleep.

She will be a star at your next office party and she will know how much you love and admire her.

If you have kids, find a reliable babysitter so you won't have to worry about them for the night. This will allow you two to focus on each other completely. It doesn't have to be every week if you are both too busy with work and family. Make sure there isn't too many weeks between the dates and make them frequent.

It can even be as simple as asking her if you can help take some of the weight off of her by letting her know you are there for her. Don't wait for her to tell you when things need to be done.

You will stop listening to what she has to say and take away the opportunity for her to vent. Let her rage and complain to you, getting out her frustrations. Let her know you are listening by nodding along as she complains. Having you there supporting her is what she wants and will make her happy. Keep your replies simple and heartfelt.
