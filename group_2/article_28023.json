Squats are a good way to pump up your thighs, and adding dumbbells or a barbell makes the exercise even more effective. Start with dumbbells you can lift 10 times without needing a break (10-20 pounds (4.5-9 kg) is a good starting weight for beginners). To squat safely: [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands grasping dumbbells at your sides (or holding a barbell behind your head or at your chest). Bend your knees and lower your butt towards the floor in a squatting position. Hold your back straight and squat until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Keep your knees straight above your feet (don’t let them go past your toes). Push back up to your starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 squats."

Try it without weights to get the form down if this is a new move for you, then add weights when you’re comfortable to build bigger legs . To do lunges: [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stand with your feet shoulder-length apart, and hold your dumbbells at your sides. If it’s more comfortable, hold them at your shoulders instead. Take a big step forward with one foot, dropping your opposite knee toward the floor (if you’re stepping with your right foot, drop your left knee toward the ground and vice versa). Keep your torso vertical to the ground with your knees aligned over your feet. Do not move the knee beyond your toes. Rise back to the starting position and immediately step forward with the opposite foot. Aim to do 3 sets of 15 reps. Once you have mastered this exercise, try increasing this to 4-5 sets of 10-12 reps with heavier weights."

Work without dumbbells or barbells for this exercise, since you might need your hands to catch you if you trip. [3] X Research source To box jump properly: Stand in front of the box with your toes pointed toward it. Jump explosively upward and land on the balls of your feet on the top of the box. Jump back down to the starting position. Work your way up until you are able to do 3 sets of 15 reps. Eventually, you may be able to do 4-5 sets of 10-12 reps."

If you don’t have a barbell, use two dumbbells that add up to the equivalent weight. Then, to safely pick up the barbell or dumbbells, bend your knees while keeping your back straight, and engage your abdominal muscles. [4] X Research source To deadlift: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place the barbell or dumbbells in front of you. Once you’ve picked up the weights, stand while hinging your hips forward. Keep your back straight and your abs contracted as you stand. Once you’ve risen, the weights will be at thigh-height. Bend again to lower the weight back to the floor. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps."

      "content": "Use leg exercise machines for moves like leg extensions and leg curls. Exercise machines allow you to gradually add more weight, target individual muscles, and increase the intensity of your workouts to promote muscle growth. For each exercise, start with the amount of weight you can lift with your legs 8-10 times before you need to stop. If needed, work with a trainer at your gym to determine the right weight for you. Try: Leg extensions (quads): Sit on the leg extension machine with your knees bent and your feet under the lower bar. To lift the weight, straighten your legs but keep a slight bend in the knee. Hold until you feel the burn in your quads, then lower the weight back to starting the position. Do 3 sets of 10-12 reps. Standing leg curls (hamstrings): Load the leg curl machine with weight, then attach the cable to your ankle and hold the support bar with your hands. Bend your knee toward your butt to lift the weight, then straighten it back to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg. Leg press (full leg): Load the weight rack and sit down, keeping your back pressed against the back of the seat. Plant both feet firmly on the weight plate and press the plate forward or upward, depending on the orientation of the machine. Aim for 3 sets of 8-10 reps. Calf raises (calves): Look for a seated calf raise machine and add weight. Sit down and place your knees under the padded bar with your feet planted on the floor, then raise your heels to move the weight. Go for 3 sets of 15-20 reps."

      "content": "Limit cardio training to no more than 3 hours per week. Some cardio is essential to your health, but too much can actually make your legs more slender. For balance, do cardio with some resistance to help build leg muscle and contribute to your overall fitness. Try swimming, running or biking uphill, or hiking to increase your lower body strength. Try working in 3-4 cardio sessions per week that last about 30 minutes (preferably on rest days and never right before a lifting session—you need your energy!)."

      "content": "Aim for 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps with heavy weights for most leg lifts. Your legs are already used to working out all the time by carrying you everywhere you go. To encourage muscle growth, do high-intensity workouts using as much weight as you can while still keeping the correct form. If you can’t make it to 12 reps, stop the set once you hit exhaustion and give yourself about 30 seconds of rest between sets. Always focus on good form for safety and maximum gains—if you’re barely eking out your 12th rep with improper form, it doesn’t count! Once you can move a certain weight for 3 sets of 12 reps, add more weight to continue developing strength and size. It may take a few weeks before you’re ready to increase the weight. Stop if you feel pain beyond the normal “burn” of a good workout. Injuries can bench you for weeks at a time and hinder your progress.

      "content": "Do both fast, explosive movements and slow, controlled lifts. There’s lots of debate over which lift speed builds muscle mass the fastest, and the truth is that it varies for each person based on their goals and genetics. In general, slower lifts (up to 3 counts) put your muscles under tension longer and encourage growth (hypertrophy) and endurance. Faster lifts also build mass and can boost your power, too. [6] X Research source To develop your strength, endurance, and power alongside your leg size, alternate between workouts centered on slow lifts and ones focused on fast lifts. Experiment with both slow and fast lifts to see which triggers the most growth for your muscles. If you see better results one way or the other, stick with that method for most (but not every single) leg workout."

[7] X Research source Aim to exercise your leg muscles 2-3 days per week to maximize growth and allow plenty of recovery time. A weekly routine might look like: Monday: Legs Tuesday: Chest and back Wednesday: Rest Thursday: Legs Friday: Arms Saturday: Core Sunday: Rest On rest days, try low-impact activities like yoga or walking to keep your muscles engaged without pushing them too far.

      "content": "Eat a surplus of calories from nutritious, healthy food sources. When you’re working on building muscles, you need a calorie surplus (consuming more calories than you expend) for your muscles to grow larger. This doesn’t mean you should start gorging yourself on any old snack food, though. Instead, eat plenty of lean meat, tofu, whole grains, beans, fresh fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats like avocado or olive oil. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Limit processed foods, sugar and white flour, fast food, and snack foods. These leave you feeling tired instead of energetic and ready to work out. The exact number of calories you need depends on your current weight and muscle gain goals. For most people, eating 5-10% more calories than you burn in a day leads to muscle growth. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Muscles grow when the amount of protein your body synthesizes per day is greater than the protein that it breaks down. Get the majority of your protein from lean meat sources like beef, chicken, pork, or fish, or from plant-based sources and dairy products like tofu, beans, quinoa, barley, eggs, cottage cheese, or yogurt. For example, if you weigh 165 pounds (74.8 kg), you’d need between 82.5 and 132 grams of protein per day to build muscle Remember that protein only builds muscle when you’re also working out regularly. If you’re sedentary on a high-protein diet, you may start accumulating fat rather than muscle."

Keep up your healthy workout routine, diet, and water intake, too—supplements alone won’t make your legs bigger.
