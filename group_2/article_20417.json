      "content": "Get cars, kids, and animals out of the way. The clearer your garage is, the easier it will be to track the hummingbird and make sure it flies away. Move any large objects out of the way of the garage door, and drive your car out if it’s inside, too. [1] X Research source Loud noises from children and pets could startle the bird, causing it to fly further into the garage. Ideally, keep one person in the garage trying to get the bird out, and let everyone else exit."

      "title": "Keep the area dark so the hummingbird flies low.",
      "content": "Keep the area dark so the hummingbird flies low. Unlike other birds, who will instinctively fly toward a window, hummingbirds tend to fly up toward the ceiling. To help guide the hummingbird out, shut all the doors and windows, then close the blinds. If the hummingbird can’t see, it will drop low toward the ground instead of flying high. [2] X Research source Hummingbirds tend to fly upwards to avoid tree branches that could get in their way."

      "title": "Keep the garage door open wide in case the bird flies out on its own.",
      "content": "Keep the garage door open wide in case the bird flies out on its own. Give the hummingbird a big space to head toward if they want to leave. You never know—you might just encounter a smart hummingbird who knows to turn around and head for the exit. Make sure that all the doors and windows to your home are shut. If the hummingbird flies out and gets disoriented, you don’t want it to head into your home next!"

      "title": "A bird feeder or a red object will lure the hummingbird out.",
      "content": "A bird feeder or a red object will lure the hummingbird out. It’s likely that the hummingbird flew into the garage in the first place because they were after red “flowers” (which might be a red gas can, a red lawn mower, or even a red paint can). If you have a bird feeder or another bright red object nearby, place it near the open garage door to tempt the bird outside. [3] X Research source Hummingbird feeders are ideal, since the bird will be attracted to their favorite food. However, a red children’s toy or tool from the shed might work, too. Make your own hummingbird nectar by mixing sugar and water together."

      "title": "Offer up a lawn tool as a resting spot for a tired hummingbird.",
      "content": "Offer up a lawn tool as a resting spot for a tired hummingbird. If the bird doesn’t seem interested in flying out on its own, offer it some help. Raise up the end of a rake or a pool net to see if the bird will land on it. If they don’t seem interested, try placing fake flowers or red objects onto the tool to make it more enticing. [4] X Research source If the bird does land on your yard tool, carefully and slowly carry it out of the garage. Place it near a hummingbird feeder or a flower so the bird can refuel and fly away."

      "title": "Carefully carry the bird outside if it stops flying.",
      "content": "Carefully carry the bird outside if it stops flying. If the hummingbird drops down to the ground, carefully cup them in your hands without squeezing or squishing them. Place the bird near a hummingbird feeder or a flower so it can eat before flying off. [5] X Research source Hummingbirds often stop flying to rest and to eat. If it’s been more than 15 minutes or so, the hummingbird in your garage might be too exhausted to keep going. Hummingbirds are very small and very fragile. Be extra careful when picking up a hummingbird so you don’t injure it. If the bird is already dead, wear gloves when handling it."

      "content": "Animal control will carefully remove the hummingbird to safety. If you’ve tried everything and you just can’t tempt the hummingbird out, it’s time to call in the professionals. Contact your local animal control center or a bird sanctuary near you to come and rescue the bird from your home. [6] X Research source Most animal services are funded by the county. To find yours, search “your county” + “animal control.”"

      "content": "Avoid anymore hummingbird mishaps by closing entrances to your garage. Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red, so they may investigate your garage again. Try to keep the garage door shut as often as possible, and cover up any bright red objects so the hummingbird isn’t tempted to come in. [7] X Research source Most garage door emergency release handles (the pulley near the top of the garage) are red. Try painting it a different color or tucking it out of sight to keep hummingbirds from coming in."
