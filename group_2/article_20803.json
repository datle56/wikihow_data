    {
      "title": "Prepare the medication.",
      "content": "Prepare the medication. Measure out the appropriate dose of Gabapentin into an oral syringe. Place the medication next to the spot where you will be administering it. A counter top or table are good options, as they will allow you to give your cat the liquid without having to bend down to their level. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get your cat ready for the dosage.",
      "content": "Get your cat ready for the dosage. Bring your cat to the spot where you will administer the Gabapentin. Pet your cat to calm it down. If you suspect that your cat will put up a fight, wrap a thick towel around it, which will restrict movement and reduce the cat’s anxiety. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your cat the medication.",
      "content": "Give your cat the medication. Place your cat in front of you with it facing away from you, with its hindquarters leaning against you. Gently tilt you cat’s head upwards and position the end of the syringe at the back corner of its mouth. Dispense the medication into the space between your cat’s cheek and gums. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Reward your cat.",
      "content": "Reward your cat. Immediately reward your cat by petting it and feeding it a treat. If your cat is wrapped in a towel, unwrap it immediately and feed it another treat. Pet and praise your cat to create positive associations with the process, which will occur regularly. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Position your cat.",
      "content": "Position your cat. Hold your cat against you, facing away from you (wrapped in a towel to restrict its movement, if necessary). With one hand, steady your cat’s head and tilt it upwards. Make sure that your cat stays leaned up against you. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Insert the pill into your cat’s mouth.",
      "content": "Insert the pill into your cat’s mouth. Using your other hand, grasp a Gabapentin pill between your thumb and forefinger. Use your middle finger to open your cat’s mouth as gently as possible and insert the pill. Slide the pill down your cat’s tongue, as far backwards as you can go. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold your cat’s mouth closed.",
      "content": "Hold your cat’s mouth closed. Remove your finger and close your cat’s mouth gently. Hold your cat’s mouth closed until it swallows. If this does not occur after a few seconds, gently rub your cat’s throat under its chin to encourage swallowing. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a pill-giver.",
      "content": "Use a pill-giver. If you want to avoid putting your fingers in your cat’s mouth, ask your veterinarian if they can provide you with a pill-giver. This syringe-like device uses a soft nozzle to plunge the pill toward the back of your cat’s mouth, and can be used in the same way you would administer liquid medication with a syringe. After inserting a pill with the pill-giver, gently close your cat’s mouth and encourage it to swallow the pill. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use the three treat trick.",
      "content": "Use the three treat trick. Purchase cat treats that are either hollow or soft enough to be molded around a pill. Start by giving your cat one plain treat, then immediately feed it a treat with a pill hidden inside of it. Have a third treat ready at the same time so that your cat consumes the second treat quickly to get to the third. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ask your veterinarian of you can divide the pills.",
      "content": "Ask your veterinarian of you can divide the pills. If your cat resists swallowing full size pills, ask your veterinarian if cutting them into smaller pieces is an option. Use a pill cutter to evenly divide the Gabapentin pills into smaller pill fragments, which can be hidden in treats more easily. Very small pill fragments can also be hidden in a small amount of canned food. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for side effects.",
      "content": "Look for side effects. The most common side effects in cats that are given Gabapentin are mild sedation and ataxia (i.e. loss of control of bodily movements). Call your veterinarian if you are concerned that your cat’s symptoms may be too severe or dangerous (e.g. putting your cat at risk for injury). Your cat’s cancer, cancer treatments, or other medications may also be causing side effects, which your veterinarian will best be able to assess. [11] X Research source Usually common side effects like poor coordination are temporary and will improve after a few days."

    {
      "title": "Observe your cat’s pain level.",
      "content": "Observe your cat’s pain level. Monitor your cat while it is on Gabapentin to assess the drug’s effectiveness in treating pain. If your pet is experiencing intense pain as a result of its cancer or cancer treatment, it may require a more intense pain reliever (e.g. a strong opioid drug like morphine). Call your vet if your cat’s discomfort does not seem to improve after several days on Gabapentin. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stop providing the medication gradually, if necessary.",
      "content": "Stop providing the medication gradually, if necessary. If you choose to stop giving your cat Gabapentin, discontinue it gradually over a period of two to three weeks. Stopping the medication abruptly can cause rebound pain or seizures, in some cases. If your cat is on a higher dosage of Gabapentin, ask your veterinarian about switching to a lower dose temporarily to taper off the medication, or administer it less frequently (e.g. once a day instead of every 12 hours). [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Assess your cat’s pain.",
      "content": "Assess your cat’s pain. If your cat is suffering from cancer, it may experience pain as a result of the disease as well as the treatments for it (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation), which you should convey to your veterinarian. The level of pain that your cat experiences may vary due to factors such as its age, what stage the disease is in, where the cancer is located, and your cat’s personal pain tolerance. While assessing your pet’s comfort level can be a difficult task, there are many probable indicators of pain such as: [14] X Research source Decrease in energy Reclusiveness Reduced appetite Negative reaction to touch Increased vocalization (e.g. whining or hissing)"

    {
      "title": "Consult your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Consult your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will tell you if Gabapentin is a good pain relief option for your cat during cancer treatment, taking into account its other symptoms and other medications your cat may be taking. The drug can be prescribed by veterinarians for chronic pain treatment, control of seizures or for easing nerve associated pains. Tell your veterinarian if your pet is receiving antacids or narcotics for pain (e.g. morphine or hydrocodone), or if your pet suffers kidney impairment. [15] X Research source However, an advantage of Gabapentin is that it can be safely used in combination with certain other pain relieving medications."

    {
      "title": "Make sure that you get a compounded form of the drug.",
      "content": "Make sure that you get a compounded form of the drug. Gabapentin is a drug designed for pain relief and seizure control in humans, and is not approved by the FDA for use in pets. While veterinarians can prescribe this medication for cats, the human version is not safe because it contains xylitol, a sweetener that is toxic to pets. Make sure that you receive Gabapentin in a form compounded especially for cats (in either liquid or pill form) before administering the drug. Never administer any form of Gabapentin to your cat that has not been approved and prescribed by your veterinarian."
