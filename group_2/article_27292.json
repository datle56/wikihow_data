      "content": "Reopen and fill the bottle to the neck with fresh, cool, clean water. Leave about an inch of head space, then securely screw the cap down to seal. The head space is necessary to leave room for gasses that will be produced during fermentation. Invert the bottle repeatedly to thoroughly dissolve sugar. Check the bottom of the bottle because the sugar tends to stick in little pockets there. The ginger root will not dissolve, of course."

Press down on the bits to get all of the juice out of the mixture. Once you've got as much liquid out as possible, throw the bowl in an ice bath or set in the refrigerator until the concoction reaches room temperature -- 68 to 72°F (20 to 22°C)."

Twist the cap on the bottle until it's securely on and gently shake to mix everything together. Leave it alone and at room temperature for 48 hours. But no longer! If you leave it out too long, the taste will start to become too bitter as the yeast ferments."

      "content": "Open 'er up. Pop open the top and check for the right amount of carbonation. If there seems to be enough, throw that baby in the fridge. If not, wait a little longer. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, opening the bottle at least once a day to let out excess carbonation. Otherwise pressure will build up and you risk it exploding."
