      "title": "Know the different notes.",
      "content": "Know the different notes. Perfumes are a blend of different levels of scent, also called “notes”. When you spray a fragrance on your skin, it moves through these notes in the following order: Top notes are what you smell first. They are also what disappears first, usually within 10 to 15 minutes. Middle notes appear as the top notes die off. These are the fragrance’s core, determining which family the perfume belongs to — for example, oriental, woody, fresh, or floral. Base notes accentuate and fix the fragrance’s middle notes, also known as its theme. They comprise the fragrance’s foundation, making the scent last up to 4 or 5 hours on your skin."

      "content": "Know the ratios. When mixing a fragrance, first add your base notes, then your middle notes, then finally, your top notes. The ideal ratio for blending notes is 30% top notes, 50% middle notes, and 20% base notes. Some perfumers recommend combining a maximum of 3 to 4 dominant notes."

    {
      "title": "Know the basic recipe.",
      "content": "Know the basic recipe. To make a perfume, you need more than just the top, middle, and base notes: you also need something to add them to. Your process begins with a carrier oil. Popular choices include sandalwood, jojoba, sweet almond, and grape seed oil. Next, you’ll slowly add drops of your base, middle, and top notes to the carrier oil. Finally, you’ll add something to help merge the ingredients together. Alcohol is a popular choice because it evaporates quickly and helps diffuse the perfume’s notes. A common choice amongst DIY perfumers is a high-quality, 80- to 100-proof (40% to 50% alc/vol) vodka. If you’re looking to make a solid perfume (more like a lip balm), use melted beeswax for the fixative instead of alcohol or water."

      "title": "Buy dark glass containers.",
      "content": "Buy dark glass containers. Many people recommend using dark glass containers because the dark glass helps protect your perfume from light, which can shorten its lifespan. You’ll also want to make sure your glass containers haven’t previously contained any food items, as any residual scents will transfer to your perfume. The exception to this would be if you actually wanted to use the scent of what was in the glass container before. (Warning: peanut-butter-banana-chocolate perfume might taste better than it smells!)"

      "title": "Buy a carrier oil.",
      "content": "Buy a carrier oil. A carrier oil is what carries the scents in a particular fragrance on to your skin. These are generally unscented, and are used to dilute concentrated oils and aromatics that can otherwise irritate your skin. Your carrier oil can really be anything. You can even use olive oil if you don’t mind the scent. One popular perfumer simmers rose petals in virgin olive oil, then combines it all with vitamin E oil to stabilize it. [5] X Research source"

Other DIY perfumers favour 190-proof (80% alc/vol) alcohol. Popular choices for 190-proof alcohol include organic neutral grape alcohol and the much cheaper Everclear, which is a grain spirit.

      "content": "Obtain a clean glass container. The type of container isn’t as important as the material: just make sure that a) it’s clean and b) it’s glass. The container also needs to have a tight-fitting lid.But having dark containers also helps for preserving. Perfumers generally recommend using dark glass, which can lengthen the fragrance’s life by protecting it from light. Avoid using jars that have previously contained food items, even if they’ve been washed out, as the glass might pass the scent on."
