      "title": "Get a durable tent.",
      "content": "Get a durable tent. A canvas tent is the most durable option, but they can be expensive. Canvas tents will keep out the rain, and they won't get as hot inside because the fabric is breathable. If you're on a budget, look for a nylon tent that comes with a rainfly to keep you dry when it rains. If you go with nylon, you should apply a waterproof treatment to the outside of the tent before you use it. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that canvas tents are heavier and harder to set up than nylon tents. If you think you'll be moving around a lot, a nylon tent may be your best option."

      "content": "Choose a large tent so you have room to spread out. Look for something designed for at least three people, if not more. Don't be afraid to go with a six or seven person tent if you plan on living in it for a while. Even if you're the only person who will be using the tent, it may be wise to get one that's sized for at least two people. That way, you can store your gear inside your tent and won't have to go outside every time you want to retrieve some equipment.

      "content": "Get a camouflage tent if you’re trying to be discreet. If you’ll be setting up camp in a busier area, or you’re just worried about people finding your tent, a camouflage tent will make it easier to hide your new home. Avoid traditional camping tents that come in bright colors like blue, red, and yellow."

      "content": "Get a pop-up tent if you’ll be moving around a lot. It’s easiest to live in a tent if you stay put in one place, but sometimes that’s not possible. If you plan on changing locations a lot, go with a pop-up tent that you can easily set up and disassemble."

      "title": "Put up your tent at a free campsite.",
      "content": "Put up your tent at a free campsite. Look online for nearby dispersed campsites that are free. At a campsite, you’ll have a flat, cleared-out spot to set up your tent, and maybe even a fire pit. Some campsites also have communal bathrooms you could use. Make sure you check on the campground's website if they require reservations. Find out how long you’re allowed to stay at the campsite before you go there. Most dispersed campsites have limits on how long you can stay. These limits can range from a week to several weeks. After the limit is up, pack up your tent and relocate to a different campsite. Try to find free campsites that are open to the public year round."

      "content": "Look for a secluded spot if you have no other options. Try to avoid busy cities and parks. Make sure you’re not setting up your tent on private property. Investigate the area carefully and check for any signs that say “private property.” Keep in mind that even though a spot isn't privately owned, you still might not be able to set up your tent there. Choose a remote place in the woods or countryside where you'll be less likely to be bothered by the police or park rangers."

If you can't afford a carpet or padding, use a thick blanket or comforter instead. Towels are also good to use for padding because they'll absorb any liquids that get into the tent and keep you and your belongings dry.
