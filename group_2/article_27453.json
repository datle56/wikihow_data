      "content": "Mix together Borax activator into 2 c (470 mL) clear glue. Pour approximately 2 c (470 mL) clear glue into a mixing bowl—you can make a rough estimate rather than using a measuring cup that the glue would stick to. [1] X Research source In a separate container, mix ½ tsp (2g) Borax into 1 c (240 mL) hot water until it dissolves—this mixture is your slime activator. Pour the activator into the bowl of clear glue. Any glass or plastic mixing bowl will work, but stainless steel containers are especially handy as the slime is less likely to stick to the bowl."

      "content": "Gradually knead activated instant snow into your clear slime. Combine a heaping spoonful of instant snow with lukewarm water to make the snow expand and activate. Add enough water so the snow is fairly wet but still maintains its white color—if the snow looks clear, you’ve added too much water. Dump the activated snow onto the center of your clear slime and stretch the slime to combine. [2] X Research source It’s normal for the snow to melt your slime a bit—if this happens, add another small spoonful of activator."

      "content": "Let the slime sit for 30-45 minutes so the snow can expand. After about a 45-minute waiting period, the slime should take on that signature icy texture and have almost doubled in size. At this point, you can add more ingredients to change the texture of your slime to your exact liking. If you want your icee slime texture to be more drizzly and loose, add more instant snow. If you want to make your snow more “sizzly” and crunchy, add in a few pumps of foam soap."

Add a few drops of food coloring into the whole and knead the slime to mix it in. Incorporate more drops of food coloring until you reach your desired shade. You can also add a small amount of glitter to your slime—try fine glitter for a subtle shimmer or star-shaped glitter for a cosmic icee slime. Add even more personality to your icee slime by mixing in slime charms . You can find slime sprinkles and charms in practically any shape, so you can choose something that matches the theme of your slime or just something that you think looks cute!"
