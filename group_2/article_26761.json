Mash and stir the avocado with the other ingredients until they form a paste, which you can rub onto your face with your fingertips. [2] X Research source Put the avocado mixture on the driest parts of your face first. Continue spreading the avocado paste around until your entire face is covered. You can substitute pumpkin for the avocado. Pumpkins are rich in vitamins A, C, and E and have natural exfoliating properties. Look for canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling) at the grocery store and mix that with the other ingredients you're using to make the mask out of.
