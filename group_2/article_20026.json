      "content": "Wash your hair, but skip the conditioner if your hair is fine and straight. You’ll want to have clean hair for your braids, so shampoo as you normally would. However, conditioner can make the hair too silky if it is fine and straight, and silky hair has a hard time holding a curl. If your hair is very coarse and tangled and you absolutely must use some conditioner, use sparingly. It will make a big difference in how well your waves hold."

Scrubbing or wrapping your hair with a towel can roughen the hair shaft and give you a head full of frizz. [1] X Research source Wet hair is fragile hair, so be extra gentle whenever you’re working on it. If you can’t squeeze out all the water with your hands, invest in a microfiber towel or use a smooth cotton shirt to dry your hair. You can use these to press out the excess water while avoiding the rough texture of a normal towel. [2] X Research source"

A sea salt spray can give your hair the same waves created by ocean water. [4] X Research source Spray the sea salt evenly throughout your hair. The label on the spray will typically say to scrunch your hair afterwards, but the braids will do all the “scrunching” for you. You certainly don't need to run out and purchase a sea salt spray to get perfect waves. Any product that gives your hair some holding power, like mousse or a styling spray for wet hair, will work. You can also use curling cream. [5] X Expert Source Ndeye Anta Niang Hair Stylist & Master Braider Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. These products will also give your hair some added \"grit\" to help it hold waves. Adding some product may help to prevent frizz, but you can also skip the product completely, if you choose. Braiding wet hair can create gorgeous waves without any sort of spray or mousse, just experiment with your hair to see what works best! If your hair is really tangled after you wash it, apply a detangling product before you comb it out.

[7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Additionally, getting afro-textured hair wet will make it form tighter curls than you want to create. Instead, you may want to create your braids using a moisturizer or oil on dry hair. If you want to start with clean hair, then you can shampoo and condition your hair and follow that up by blow drying your hair while it is in braids. This will create elongated waves when you undo the braids."

The more hair in a section, the looser your waves will be. If you have very thin hair, you may only need to one or two sections. If you have very thick hair, you might want to separate it into more sections. Clip the hair you are not currently braiding out of the way."

[8] X Research source Remember, wherever the braids start, the waves will start. If you’d like your hair to be smoother at the top of your head and form loose waves around your face, start your braid lower. If you’d like volume and waves at the top, start the braid near the root. Traditional three strand braids work perfectly fine. However, you can experiment with french braids and fishtail braids to see all the different kinds of waves you can create."

Additionally, tying the end of the braid too tightly can create an unsightly indentation in the hair. Secure the elastic firmly enough so that it holds the braid if you toss and turn during the night, but not so tightly that it crushes the strands. [10] X Research source Using cloth elastics rather than rubber elastics can help avoid the indent, and also prevent from potential damage.
