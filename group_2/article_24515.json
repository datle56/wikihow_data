      "content": "Telegram is a free messaging app for one-on-one convos, groups, and large channels. Telegram is a free app that allows you to message other users privately, create group chats, or even public channels run by minor celebrities or news organizations. You can also use the app to make voice or video calls and share small files with others. [1] X Research source Telegram is somewhat controversial among certain people because it refuses to censor anything—including things like hate speech, terroristic threats, and other illegal activity. Telegram also refuses to share any data with governments, which is why its CEO was arrested. [2] X Research source Telegram was founded by a set of Russian brothers, but it’s not a state-supported company. In fact, Putin has repeatedly tried to shut Telegram down because they refused to share data with the Kremlin. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "In terms of message security, Telegram is extremely safe. Telegram uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that messages are unreadable unless the “keys” on both ends (the recipient and the sender) match. This means your messages aren’t even readable on Telegram’s servers. As a result, Telegram is widely considered one of the safest ways to communicate if you favor privacy. [4] X Research source In theory, Telegram could choose to decrypt your messages on their servers without your permission, but there’s no evidence they’ve done that or intend to do it in the future."

      "content": "When it comes to safe content, Telegram is basically the Wild West. If you’re a parent and your child expresses a desire to poke around on Telegram, it’s best to not let them. Telegram refuses to moderate any of the content on its platform, so there are a lot of ways for a minor to be exposed to something they shouldn’t see. [5] X Research source Due to its refusal to moderate content, Telegram has become a hotspot for hackers, cybercriminals, and scammers. If you aren’t seasoned at spotting online scams , you’re best staying off Telegram. [6] X Research source"

Instead, it will be encrypted and stored on Telegram’s cloud server where it will be unopenable. As a result, there is no way for anybody who doesn’t have direct access to your account to see what you’re sharing. [7] X Research source The only information of yours that isn’t encrypted is your location (if you share it), your username, your email, and a handful of cookies that are stored to keep the app running smoothly. Notably, none of this information makes you identifiable on its own."
