If you don't have these skills mastered, it will be tricky to tackle the more complex concepts taught in algebra. If you need a refresher on these operations, try our article on basic math skills . You don't necessarily need to be great at doing these basic operations in your head to do algebra problems. Many algebra classes will allow you to use a calculator to save time when doing these simple operations. You should, however, at least know how to do these operations without a calculator for when you aren't allowed to use one."

      "title": "Know the order of operations.",
      "content": "Know the order of operations. One of the trickiest things about solving an algebra equation as a beginner is knowing where to start. Luckily, there's a specific order for solving these problems: first do any math operations in parentheses, then do exponents , then multiply, then divide, then add, and finally subtract. A handy tool for remembering this order of operations is the acronym PEMDAS . [3] X Research source Learn how to apply the order of operations here . To recap, the order of operations is: P arentheses E xponents M ultiplication D ivision A ddition S ubtraction The order of operations is important in algebra because doing the operations in an algebra problem in the wrong order can sometimes affect the answer. For instance, if we're dealing with the math problem 8 + 2 × 5, if we add 2 to 8 first, we get 10 × 5 = 50 , but if we multiply 2 and 5 first, we get 8 + 10 = 18 . Only the second answer is correct."

In algebra, it's common to use negative numbers, so it's smart to review how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide negatives before starting to learn algebra. [4] X Research source Below are just a few negative number basics to keep in mind — for more information, see our articles on adding and subtracting negative numbers and dividing and multiplying negative numbers . On a number line , a negative version of a number is the same distance from zero as the positive, but in the opposite direction. Adding two negative numbers together makes the number more negative (in other words, the digits will be higher, but since the number is negative, it counts as being lower) Two negative signs cancel out — subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number Multiplying or dividing two negative numbers gives a positive answer. Multiplying or dividing a positive number and a negative number gives a negative answer."

To avoid errors, keep your work organized by starting a new line every time you make a step toward solving your problem. If you're dealing with a two-sided equation, try to write all the equals signs (\"=\"s) underneath each other. [5] X Research source This way, if you make a mistake somewhere, it'll be much easier to find and correct. For example, to solve the equation 9/3 - 5 + 3 × 4, we might keep our problem organized like this: 9/3 - 5 + 3 × 4 9/3 - 5 + 12 3 - 5 + 12 3 + 7 10"

Variables aren't as confusing as they may first seem - they're just ways of showing numbers with unknown values. Below are just a few common examples of variables in algebra: [6] X Research source Letters like x, y, z, a, b, and c Greek letters like theta, or θ Note that not all symbols are unknown variables. For instance, pi, or π, is always equal to about 3.14159."

      "title": "Think of variables as \"unknown\" numbers.",
      "content": "Think of variables as \"unknown\" numbers. As mentioned above, variables are basically just numbers with unknown values. [7] X Research source In other words, there's some number that can go in place of the variable to make the equation work. Usually, your goal in an algebra problem is to figure out what the variable is — think of it as a \"mystery number\" that you're trying to discover. For example, in the equation 2x + 3 = 11, x is our variable. This means that there's some value that goes in the place of x to make the left side of the equation equal 11. Since 2 × 4 + 3 = 11, in this case, x = 4 . An easy way to start understanding variables is to replace them with question marks in algebra problems. For example, we might re-write the equation 2 + 3 + x = 9 as 2 + 3 + ? = 9. This makes it easier to understand what we're trying to do — we just need to find out what number to add to 2 + 3 = 5 to get 9. The answer is again 4 , of course."

      "title": "Watch for recurring variables.",
      "content": "Watch for recurring variables. If a variable appears more than once, simplify the variables. [8] X Research source What do you do if the same variable appears more than once in the equation? Though this situation may seem tricky to solve, you can actually treat variables how you'd treat normal numbers — in other words, you can add them, subtract them, and so on as long as you only combine variables that are alike. In other words, x + x = 2x, but x + y doesn't equal 2xy. For example, let's look at the equation 2x + 1x = 9. In this case, we can add 2x and 1x together to get 3x = 9. Since 3 x 3 = 9, we know that x = 3 . Note again that you can only add the same variables together. In the equation 2x + 1y = 9, we can't combine 2x and 1y because they are two different variables. This is also true for when one variable has a different exponent than another. For instance, in the equation 2x + 3x 2 = 10, we can't combine 2x and 3x 2 because the x variables have different exponents. See How to Add Exponents for more information."

      "title": "Try to get the variable by itself in algebra equations.",
      "content": "Try to get the variable by itself in algebra equations. Solving an equation in algebra usually means finding out what the variable is. Algebra equations are usually set up with numbers and/or variables on both sides, like this: x + 2 = 9 × 4. To figure out what the variable is, you need to get it by itself on one side of the equals sign. Whatever is left on the other side of the equals sign is your answer. In the example (x + 2 = 9 × 4), to get x by itself on the left side of the equation, we need to get rid of the \"+ 2\". To do this, we'll simply subtract 2 from that side, leaving us with x = 9 × 4. However, to keep both sides of the equation equal, we also need to subtract 2 from the other side. This leaves us with x = 9 × 4 - 2. Following the order of operations, we multiply first, then subtract, giving us an answer of x = 36 - 2 = 34 ."

To do this, we perform the \"opposite\" operation on both sides of the equation. For instance, in the equation x + 3 = 0, since we see a \"+ 3\" next to our x, we'll put a \"- 3\" on both sides. The \"+ 3\" and \"- 3\", leaving x by itself and \"-3\" on the other side of the equals sign, like this: x = -3. In general, addition and subtraction are like \"opposites\" — do one to get rid of the other. See below: For addition, subtract. Example: x + 9 = 3 → x = 3 - 9 For subtraction, add.

With multiplication and division, you must perform the opposite operation on everything on the other side of the equals sign, even if it's more than one number. See below: For multiplication, divide. Example: 6x = 14 + 2→ x = (14 + 2) /6 For division, multiply. Example: x/5 = 25 → x = 25 × 5"

Exponents are a fairly advanced pre-algebra topic — if you don't know how to do them, see our basic exponent article for more information. The \"opposite\" of an exponent is the root that has the same number as it. For example, the opposite of the 2 exponent is a square root (√), the opposite of the 3 exponent is the cube root ( 3 √), and so on. [9] X Research source It may be a little confusing, but, in these cases, you take the root of both sides when dealing with an exponent. On the other hand, you take the exponent of both sides when you're dealing with a root. See below: For exponents, take the root. Example: x 2 = 49 → x = √49 For roots, take the exponent.

Does your equation make sense when x=0? When x=1? When x = -1? It's easy to make simple mistakes by writing down p=6d when you mean p=d/6, but these are easily caught if you do a quick sanity check on your work before going further. For example, let's say we're told that a football field is 30 yards (27.4 m) longer than it is wide. We use the equation l = w + 30 to represent this. We can test whether this equation makes sense by plugging in simple values for w. For instance, if the field is w = 10 yards (9.1 m) wide, it will be 10 + 30 = 40 yards (36.6 m) long. If it's 30 yards (27.4 m) wide, it will be 30 + 30 = 60 yards (54.9 m) long, and so on. This makes sense — we'd expect the field to get longer as it gets wider, so this equation is reasonable."

They can often be decimals, fractions , or irrational numbers. A calculator can help you find these complicated answers, but keep in mind that your teacher may require you to give your answer in its exact form, not in an unwieldy decimal. For instance, let's say that we narrow down an algebra equation to x = 1250 7 . If we type 1250 7 into a calculator, we'll get a huge string of decimals (plus, since the calculator's screen is only so large, it can't display the entire answer.) In this case, we may want to represent our answer as simply 1250 7 or else simplify the answer by writing it in scientific notation ."

[13] X Research source Usually, in beginning algebra, graphing problems are restricted to equations with two variables (usually x and y) and are done on a simple 2-D graph with an x axis and a y axis. With these equations, all you need to do is plug in a value for x, then solve for y (or do the reverse) to get two numbers that correspond to a point on the graph. For example, in the equation y = 3x, if we plug in 2 for x, we get y = 6. This means that the point (2,6) (two spaces to the right of center and six spaces above center) is part of this equation's graph. Equations with the form y = mx + b (where m and b are numbers) are especially common in basic algebra. These equations always have a slope of m and cross the y axis at y = b."

Solving more than one equation at once may sound super-tricky, but when you're working with simple algebra equations, it's not actually that hard. Often, algebra teachers use a graphing approach for solving these problems. When you're working with a system of two equations, the solutions are the points on a graph that the lines for both equations cross at. For example, let's say we're working with a system that contains the equations y = 3x - 2 and y = -x - 6. If we draw these two lines on a graph, we get one line that goes up at a steep angle, and one that goes down at a mild angle. Since these lines cross at the point (-1,-5) , this is a solution to the system. [16] X Research source If we want to check our problem, we can do this by plugging our answer into the equations in the system — a right answer should \"work\" for both. y = 3x - 2 -5 = 3(-1) - 2 -5 = -3 - 2 -5 = -5 y = -x - 6 -5 = -(-1) - 6 -5 = 1 - 6 -5 = -5 Both equations \"check out,\" so our answer is right!"
