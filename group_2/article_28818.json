      "content": "Select the coin you want to use for your ring. Coins that are made from silver or gold are best, as coins made from nickel and copper will leave stains on your finger. When you are first starting out with making coin rings, you should practice with smaller coins, such as nickels, dimes, or pennies. This is just to get the hang of the process. Quarters are a highly recommended coin because of their larger size. Look for quarters made prior to 1965, because until that point, quarters were made with 90% silver. Half-dollar coins are also a good option, again because of their size. It is still best to look for half-dollar coins made prior to 1965 due to their high silver makeup. [1] X Research source Half-dollars are especially recommended for people with large ring sizes."

[2] X Research source Be sure to complete the project in a garage or workshop space that you can easily accommodate all of the tools necessary. A silver coin A hammer A vise (This is a tool that can be bolted down to a table or work surface. It has a clamp with a rod that can be turned to open and close the grip onto something, like the coins, in this case. It also has an anvil on the side opposite the tightening rod.) A ring-sizing mandrel (This is a rod that is wider at one end and tapers down to a smaller point. It is used to size rings.) A drill and drill bit (recommended size: 1/8” or 3/16”) A handheld rotary tool (A rotary tool is a small, handheld device with a small rod that sticks out of the tip. Different parts can be added to the tip based on what you want to do, like file something down, polish it, et cetera.) A carbide cutting bit (This is a particular type of bit used for cutting through metal and can be attached to the rotary tool.) Calipers (Similar to a ruler, this is a measuring stick that has moveable arms. The arms are used to measure something, so you expand or narrow them to whatever the object is.)

[3] X Research source You can secure the coin in the grip of the vise to reduce the risk of hammering a finger or thumb in the upcoming steps. However, you will have to stop very frequently to turn the coin in the vise so that you tap all around it evenly. You can also grip the coin between your index finger and thumb to keep it in a standing position and prevent it from moving. This can be unsafe, as you run the risk of hammering a finger, so take care. Have an adult do this for you, if you are a youth."

Try to avoid tapping the same spot on the coin repeatedly, so as to avoid making one edge of the ring too flat. [5] X Research source Rotate the coin slightly with every tap. You can gently turn it toward you or away from you as you go. After about 10 minutes of tapping, you should observe that the reeded edge (i.e. the lined edge) has started to flatten. Eventually, those reedings should disappear altogether."

[6] X Research source Eventually, the text on the edge of the coin should start to wrap around what will soon become the inside of the ring. The coin should continue to shrink in diameter while the band of the ring continues to flatten and widen from the tapping. Half-dollar coins take even more time to tap, as they are larger than a quarter, so keep this in mind when you choose your coin."

Be sure to check for warping periodically so that you can correct it early. [7] X Research source Lay the coin down flat on the vise. Bend down to the coin's level and check for space between the coin and the surface. You can correct very minor warping with sanding later, or you can try corrective tapping to amend the warp if it is a bit bigger."

[8] X Research source Stand the coin on the flat surface of the vise again and lean it at about a 75-degree angle. Lightly tap the edges as you did before, except this time, tap them down toward the center of the ring. Remember to rotate as you tap to avoid tapping the same spot consecutively. Flip the coin to its other side and repeat. Check that the curvature is uniform by holding the holding the coin upright and rotating it in your fingers, focusing on the curvature all the way around."

[9] X Research source Use a 200-220 grit sandpaper, and lay it on a flat surface. Then, lay the coin flat on one side on the sandpaper, and gently move it in a circular motion to soften the edges. Avoid taking too much off the edges because you will start to lose some of the text and other features of the coin. Then, flip the coin to its other side and repeat."

Start out with 200-220 grit sandpaper and work your way up to about 600 grit sandpaper. The more sanding you do now, with finer grit sandpaper, the less polishing that needs to be done on the band of the ring. Do not sand inside the ring, as you will lose the details of the coin face and text."
