Build up your self confidence if it's sorely lacking. Now, this doesn't mean you have to be loud, boisterous, arrogant, chatty, or forward. It just means getting to a place where you feel comfortable in your own skin . [1] X Research source You can be secure , sweet and humble all at the same time. But be prepared to come out of your shell. Guys like confident, interesting people who lead their own lives. The only guys who like insecure people are the ones who are insecure themselves and want to dominate another human being. And who wants to be with a guy who wants a person to feel bad about themselves, or who wants to tell you how to be all the time? That's not healthy, and you deserve much better.

[3] X Expert Source Alessandra Conti Celebrity Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 23 April 2021. A little make-up can go a long way. You don't need to color-by-number your face, but mascara opens up your eyes, lip-balm enhances your smile, concealer can cover any small insecurities, and tweezers could really help nightmare eyebrows. Just wear what you are comfortable with. Dress in clothes you feel comfortable in. Don't squeeze yourself into a body-con skirt or tight jeans if that's not your usual style. A well-fitting pair of pants and a top that brings out the color of your eyes is a safe but striking combo. Smile a lot - research has found that people become more attractive to others when they smile, so flash those pearly whites as often as possible to look prettier, as well as friendlier and more approachable.

Make sure you show a little interest and drop small hints that you like him. Most guys won't ask you out because they're afraid of getting shot down. You've got to walk before you run, right? Say \"Hi\". Say \"Good-bye\". Give a little wave. When he reciprocates, you'll know that you have his attention. Introduce yourself somehow and make conversation. It's nearly impossible for someone to like you if he doesn't get to know you, unless he \"likes\" you for all the wrong reasons."

This doesn't mean you should be a giggling fool, laughing at everything that crosses your path, but you should try not to take yourself too seriously and always be ready with a laugh, especially when your crush is around. If you're too serious or straight-faced all the time, he may find you intimidating and unapproachable, which is the last thing you want. Express your sense of humor in your own way. Some people are witty and sarcastic, others can tell hilarious stories, and many people just do quirky things and poke fun at themselves. No matter what tickles your sense of humor, it's much easier to like someone who you can have a good laugh with once in a while. If you don't find something to laugh about together, then maybe you'll discover that you don't like him after all!"

You should also make it obvious in other subtle ways, such as hanging out with your friends in a place where you know he'll be, dropping subtle hints about not knowing who to go with to an event, etc. Letting your friends in on the situation is probably a good idea - they can help strategize to get the two of you together, and also diffuse any awkward situations.

Guys will usually be more open with guys than girls, but that doesn't mean that you can't get close to him as a girl- that's usually where the magic happens. Just be careful though - if it gets too platonic, you might lose the romantic connection and sometimes it can be really hard to get back that spark once you are placed firmly in the friend-zone. If this happens, things can become too complicated and you might be tempted to give up. A little bit of flirtation throughout the relationship will keep things going nicely."

Ask him stimulating, interesting questions; find out about his life, his family, his friends; tell him funny stories. Anything that opens up a dialogue between the two of you. If you can get the guy talking about something he's really passionate about - whether it's a favorite sports team, band, author - then you're on to a winner.

Just don't overdo it - guys can be shy about that sort of thing. A simple \"I love the color of your eyes\" is all you need to say. However, compliments don't just need to be focused on appearance. If he's talking about something that he loves, tell him that you admire how passionate he is. You can also compliment his sporting performance or tell him what a great job he did on a class project.

Sometimes your best bet is to tell the guy that you're interested and ask him if he feels the same. Whatever his response is, at least things will be out in the open and you can either move forward with the relationship or move on. Don't believe the hype about guys having to ask girls out. In reality, guys love strong, confident people who know what they want. In fact, just the fact that you had the courage to ask might be enough to impress the guy and make him say yes. Never get someone else to ask a guy out for you. It is immature and will increase the chances of the guy saying no. Even if you're too shy to ask him to his face, a text message or handwritten note will be much more effective than the \"send a friend\" method."
