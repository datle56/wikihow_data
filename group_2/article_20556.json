      "content": "Listen to her. You should always be the one to take the time to pay attention to what a girl is saying. It is never good if a man constantly interrupts a girl while talking. Wait until she is done speaking, and then ask a question related to what she said."

      "content": "Be her friend first. You don't have to hit on her right away, first try talking to her and getting to know her, if you haven't already, and be nice to her. You can show a genuine interest in the things that the girl likes. Try to find out more about them from her. [1] X Research source You can include it in your grand gesture or within a date.

      "content": "Try to impress her. Try to get her to go to places where you do things that may impress her. For example, if you skateboard fairly well, you could try saying something like, \"Hey, have you ever gone skateboarding before? It's really fun. Maybe you could come and watch me sometime.\" Don't go overboard with this step though because then you will probably come across as a bragger and a showoff. What girl wants a guy who tries to outdo everyone and talks about nothing but his own achievements?"

      "content": "Try breaking the touch barrier. Sometimes girls will make the first move and do it, but manning up and doing it yourself can often be better especially if the girl you like is shy. Don't be scared to do this yourself. Try offering to help her put her coat on, hold out your hand to her when she is walking on uneven ground to help her keep her balance, or, if you are really close friends and this wouldn't seem awkward to her, then hug her in a friendly manner either to congratulate her on an achievement of hers or you can even use it as a greeting."

      "title": "Ask for help.",
      "content": "Ask for help. Showing a weak side might go against everything you've ever considered \"sexy,\" but it will make the girl feel important if she can help you with something. Go up to her and ask for her help on a homework assignment. Not only will she likely help you, but you'll be able to get emotionally and physically closer to her."
