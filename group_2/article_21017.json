      "title": "You aren’t feeling well.",
      "content": "You aren’t feeling well. A stomach ache or headache is the easiest to fake. Avoid illnesses with a lot of visual signs like a cold, which usually comes with a runny, red nose and pale skin. Wrap your arms around your stomach or rub your temples, and you can buy yourself some extra hours in bed. Keep it short and sweet though—the more you try to oversell it, the less believable it can be. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source “My stomach really hurts—I think I might have eaten something funky yesterday.” “My head is pounding and it hurt when I turned my light on this morning.” “I’m really not feeling well this morning.”"

      "title": "You were exposed to COVID-19.",
      "content": "You were exposed to COVID-19. Recently, the pandemic has increased caution with sickness. COVID-19 in particular can be in your body for several days before symptoms occur, and just being near someone with it can constitute quarantining with a COVID test. Tell your parents a friend you were hanging out with tested positive recently or was exposed to it, and it’s better for you to stay home and take a test. [2] X Research source “My friend just texted me and said they have COVID. I was with them all day yesterday.” “I got a notification on my phone that there was a COVID exposure at school.” “My teacher went home early with COVID symptoms yesterday and I’m worried.”"

      "title": "You didn’t sleep well last night.",
      "content": "You didn’t sleep well last night. Even parents can agree operating on no sleep is hard. Tell them you were tossing and turning all night, and barely got any sleep. Slump your shoulders or discuss a nightmare you had if they need a bit more convincing. “I didn’t get any sleep last night. I was up late studying.” “I had this horrible nightmare and stared at the ceiling until 6 AM” “I was tossing and turning all night and barely slept an hour.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You didn’t finish your homework.",
      "content": "You didn’t finish your homework. Parents can’t argue about having a ton of homework. High school and middle school can really pile it on, too. Say you had a ton of assignments and, in an effort to not collapse in on yourself, you went to sleep and didn’t finish all of it. This may not get you the whole day to yourself, but it can buy you some extra time if you’re trying to dodge out of your first class. [3] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source “I’m sorry I had all these assignments and couldn’t finish them before I passed out asleep.” “My biology project ended up taking longer than I expected and I didn’t finish my math homework.” “I was waiting for my partner to finish the first part and they didn’t get it back to me until this morning.”"

      "title": "You want to study for a test.",
      "content": "You want to study for a test. Looking studious will win you some points as an excuse. This one works best when you actually do have a test coming up that you can point to on your schedule. Explain to your parents that you want to take extra time to study for it and ensure you get a good grade. For even more points, you can have notecards ready and a supposed plan for your study session. [4] X Research source “This test is supposed to be super hard and I want to make sure I do well on it.” “My friend bombed this test and it’s got me really worried.” “If I get a good grade on this test, I’m guaranteed an A for the semester.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You’re working on a personal project.",
      "content": "You’re working on a personal project. Having skills outside school you want to hone can be a great excuse. Whether it’s an after-school debate club or guitar lessons or a DIY Instagram post, you can ask your parents for extra time to get better at something you’re interested in. Having personal projects outside of school can have a ton of real-life benefits for your health and well-being, too. This excuse gets extra leverage if you have some deadline to meet regarding that skill, such as a competition or a giveaway on social media. [5] X Research source “I really want to memorize this song before the talent show on Saturday.” “I think getting extra time to work on my project will mean I can use it in the future for jobs and stuff!” “My friend’s birthday is coming up and I’d like to finish the blanket I’m knitting for them.”"

    {
      "title": "Your friend is having a personal emergency.",
      "content": "Your friend is having a personal emergency. You have to be there for your friends. Since you won’t be able to feign an emergency with your own family, you could say a friend is having a really bad day, or recently had a pet pass away, or is currently sick and doesn’t have anyone to watch them. This comes with the risk of your parents wanting to investigate, so be prepared to answer questions if they come up. Coordinate with a friend if possible—they could help you get out of class along with them. “My friend’s dog passed away yesterday, and she could really use someone to comfort her.” “Finn's parents are gone for the next couple days and he got sick! I want to go over and help him with his homework.” “Yesterday, Beth got into a huge fight with Fiona. I want to try to work things out between them.”"

      "title": "You want to take a mental health day.",
      "content": "You want to take a mental health day. School can be mentally exhausting in more ways than one. Allowing students to stay home for a break from all the overwhelming energy has become increasingly accepted. This may even be an excuse that isn’t too far from the truth for you. Tell your parents you’re really stressed and need a break from it all to decompress! [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source “I’ve been really stressed lately and could use a day to catch up on sleep.” “I really haven’t been feeling mentally okay the past few days and need a break.” “I’m burned out and don’t want it to affect my schoolwork.”"

    {
      "title": "You’re on your period.",
      "content": "You’re on your period. This won’t work for everyone, but is a good excuse for those it applies to. It has believably terrible (and more importantly, fairly invisible) symptoms. Plus, it can be a stressful process dealing with the worst parts of it at school. Be careful with this one though—it might mean missing out on an opportunity to call out when you’re actually on your period. “I just started my period today and my cramps are awful!” “I’m really nauseous—I started my period yesterday.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You accidentally slept late.",
      "content": "You accidentally slept late. If your parents don’t normally wake you in the morning, you could sleep in. Accidentally waking up late can throw the whole day out of whack, and if you take the bus to school, that can mean not getting there at all. This is pretty easy to pull off on purpose and make it look like an innocent accident—but is also great if you genuinely did not mean to wake up late. “Ah I slept in! I’m so sorry! I was just so tired.” “My phone died so my alarm didn’t go off.” “I forgot to set my alarm so I slept in!”"

      "title": "There’s something wrong with the school building.",
      "content": "There’s something wrong with the school building. It’s not unheard of for things to go wrong with school buildings. Whether it’s broken air conditioning or a flood or a gas leak, it can cause students to be sent home early. If you make it to school, then come right back, you can give this reason. Be careful with these ones—your parents may be able to check if they don’t believe you. [7] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source “I had to come back early because the school was freezing! The heating broke.” “The teacher sent us home early because she smelled something in the room. She says it might be a gas leak.”"

      "title": "You want to spend more time with your parents.",
      "content": "You want to spend more time with your parents. You can always tug on some heartstrings and ask for quality time. If your parents are busy people, you can say you want to spend more time with them, especially if they happen to be home while you’re at school. Of course, this means you do need to hang out with them, but if you’re avoiding school it can be a good alternative. You can even bring up how it can help your life overall! [8] X Research source “I just feel like I never get to see you and would appreciate the extra time.” “I wish I could see you more often when you aren’t working.” “There are some things I need to talk to you about.”"

      "title": "You’re avoiding certain people at school.",
      "content": "You’re avoiding certain people at school. School can be vicious, and this may even be true. Whether you’re tired of a particular bully, you’re angry at a teacher, or you’ve gotten in a fight with your best friend, you can tell your parents you need a day of avoidance to cool off. This could be a two-day prep, where you come home the day before looking angry and carry that energy over the next day. [9] X Research source “I got in a huge fight with Martina yesterday and I don’t want to see her at school today.” “My teacher has been really stressing me out recently.” “I completely messed up talking to this person I like and I’ll die of embarrassment if I have to see them.”"

      "title": "You just don’t want to go to school.",
      "content": "You just don’t want to go to school. Honesty can be the best policy. Tell your parents you just don’t want to go. This might also be a chance to consider what is making you not want to go in the first place. A lot of common excuses may be actually true, or you might have something personal going on that you can use the day off to talk about. Otherwise, if there’s nothing deeper going on, it may just work as a one-time excuse. [10] X Research source “I really just don't want to go to school today. I promise to go tomorrow.\" “Some things have been bothering me and I could really use the day to talk about them.\" “I'm constantly worried and stressed at school and I don't know how to make it better.\""

      "title": "You’re going on a family vacation.",
      "content": "You’re going on a family vacation. It’s not uncommon for families to take vacations outside the usual spring breaks and winter breaks, especially if you’re going somewhere farther away. This’ll be an excuse you can prepare ahead of time, letting your teacher know the days you’ll be gone. Don’t get overzealous with this one—unless you’re actually going on a vacation, there’s a chance you’ll get noticed if you decide to take five days off school for a fake vacation. This one’s best for a long weekend for the best chance at success. [11] X Research source “My family is going to the lake up north for the weekend. We’ll be driving all day Monday, so I won’t be in class.” “Hi Ms. Garcia, I’m just letting you know I’m not going to be here on November 1st or November 2nd—my parents and I are visiting family.” “Our flight back from Paris was delayed, so I’m going to miss a day of school while they rebook it.”"

    {
      "title": "You left something at home.",
      "content": "You left something at home. Whether it’s your keys or important medicine or your entire backpack, leaving something crucial at home will likely be a great excuse. What exactly it is and how far you live from home can factor into how successful this excuse is, so think about what will buy you the most time before explaining. [12] X Research source “Sorry Mr. Hawthorne! I left my medicine at home and had to go back and get it.” “I left my homework sitting on the counter.” “I nearly locked myself out of the house leaving my keys, so I had to rush back before Mom left for work.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You had a death in the family.",
      "content": "You had a death in the family. Funerals are a common excuse because people, especially acquaintances, aren’t inclined to grill you with questions. They’ll give condolences and, in most cases, happily give you the time off to grieve. Give a specific date for this one, and remember that it isn’t one you can use often. After the third death of a grandmother, teachers will start to get suspicious, and it can saddle you with more trouble than just detention. “My grandmother passed away last night. We’re having a funeral on April 10th.” “Mr. Blanchet, I’m not being in class on April 10th. I have to go to a funeral.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You have a dentist appointment.",
      "content": "You have a dentist appointment. Medical appointments are among the most used excuses, but the dentist is a good go-to since it doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. You’re supposed to get a cleaning every few months, so it’s easier to explain without elaboration. \"I've had a toothache for the past couple days and needed to go to the dentist for it.\" \"My cleaning was scheduled in the middle of class. If I didn't go I would have had to wait another month.\" \"My appointment changed suddenly so I had to rush over there.\""

      "title": "You were performing an act of kindness.",
      "content": "You were performing an act of kindness. Whether it’s helping an old woman cross the street, guiding a lost dog back to its owner, or helping free a child’s balloon from a tree, acts of altruism likely won’t lead to an argument. Even if your teacher doesn’t entirely believe you, they may waive it aside for the kindness of the task. [13] X Research source “I spent most of the day trying to find this lost dog’s owner. He looked so sad!” “This kid was sobbing over a toy they got stuck in some pipes. I had to help her!” “I had to run to the store before class and ended up helping this old woman with her shopping.”"

      "title": "Your car wasn’t working.",
      "content": "Your car wasn’t working. Naturally, this excuse only works if you don’t take the bus to school and instead drive yourself or are driven by your parents. However, if it applies, it’s a great, neutral excuse for truancy, since your teacher can understand the frustration, even if there may have been a way to resolve the issue. [14] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source “Ugh, I’m so sorry, my car just wouldn’t start yesterday.” “My dad was trying to fix the car all day but couldn’t get it ready in time.” “We got halfway down the road before smoke started coming out of the hood of the car. We had to stop in case it exploded!”"

      "title": "You were helping your parents with something.",
      "content": "You were helping your parents with something. Since you’re likely still adhering to what your parents tell you, pushing off the reasoning on them can be a good fallback. Say you had to stay behind to help with something around the house, or you were otherwise directed to miss school for a project related to them. This comes with the risk of them contacting your parents, but with enough finesse, you can get away with it once or twice. [15] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source “Our basement flooded yesterday and my mom needed help sucking up all the water.” “The backyard was a disaster after the storm the other night, so dad had me stay home to help clean up all the branches.” “We’re having this big family get-together this weekend and mom had me stay home to help with some cooking.”"

    {
      "title": "Bad weather stopped you from coming in.",
      "content": "Bad weather stopped you from coming in. This won’t be an excuse you can use whenever you want—bad weather has to have actually happened. Tell your teacher the recent storm hit your area particularly hard and you were able to get to class at all or on time. “A big tree fell over in our driveway—we’re lucky it didn’t hit the house!” “That blizzard made the roads a death sentence. Mom had me stay home because she was worried.” “The river up north got flooded and made it impossible to get here safely.”"

      "title": "You have a sick pet you need to care for.",
      "content": "You have a sick pet you need to care for. If you can’t get away with saying you’re sick, your pet certainly won’t need a doctor’s note. This is an especially potent excuse if your parents normally work while you’re at school—you can say there’s no one else that could watch them. [16] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source “Sorry Ms. Silva, my dog had an ear infection and I had to watch him to make sure he was okay. “My parents work all day so I had to bring my dog to the vet on my own.” “My cat recently ate something bad for her—I had to watch her until the medicine kicked in.”"

    {
      "title": "You were babysitting a younger sibling.",
      "content": "You were babysitting a younger sibling. A good excuse if you have them, childcare can be fickle for working parents, and you, the older sibling, may be the last resort for your parents. Tell your teacher your younger sibling, cousin, or other relative needed someone to watch them. [17] X Research source “Sorry, the sitter we usually have fell through and I had to watch my little brother.” “My mom usually watches my little sister but she had to go on a trip, so I stayed home to watch her.”"

      "title": "You have a job interview.",
      "content": "You have a job interview. This may not work for younger readers, but for those who are just starting to work after-school jobs, this can be a great excuse. You can push off the interview being at an inconvenient time on the hours of the place you’d be interviewing at or simply the schedule of your potential, future boss. If you are too young to be looking for jobs, say it was an orientation for an afterschool club. [18] X Research source “I’m working on getting a job and had this interview yesterday I couldn’t reschedule.” ”They rescheduled the knitting club meeting at the library to earlier in the day, so I had to miss class!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You forgot to eat.",
      "content": "You forgot to eat. This excuse may sound a little silly, but it’s actually a very common problem, especially for breakfast. This likely won’t get you out the whole day, but you could potentially get a free couple hours to ensure you’re well-fed—and prevent the whole class from experiencing you when you’re hungry. [19] X Research source “Sorry I’m late—we didn’t have anything to eat at home so I needed to stop somewhere.” “I’ve been trying to make myself breakfast every morning and I’m still working on the timing.”"

      "title": "You had a wardrobe malfunction.",
      "content": "You had a wardrobe malfunction. You certainly can’t come to school dressed poorly, especially if your school has a strict dress code. An easy excuse could be that your uniform (if applicable) was stained or torn and had to be quickly cleaned or replaced. If you don’t necessarily have uniforms, you could simply say something unsightly happened to your outfit on the way to school and you had to go back home and change. [20] X Research source “I would have been here early, but then I spilled my coffee all over my shirt.” “My dog tore up my uniform pants so Mom had to take me to the store to get more.” “The clothes I was going to wear didn’t dry properly this morning, so I had to wait.”"

      "title": "You were studying for a different class.",
      "content": "You were studying for a different class. This works best if you have a good relationship with your teacher and/or a good grade in the class. Explain that you are struggling in another course, and wanted to take extra time to study for it as a result. There’s a good chance your teacher will be sympathetic if it’s about keeping your grades up across the board. [21] X Research source “I’ve really been struggling in biology, so I stayed home a little longer to study for the test today.” “I didn’t sleep well and had to catch up on a couple chapters of the book we’re reading in English.” “Midterms are really worrying me, so I wanted to catch up on some material.”"
