[1] X Research source A sewing needle is a straightforward, practical choice, especially since it's an item you'd normally find in a first aid or survival kit that you might have on hand on a backpacking trip. You could also try these other \"needles\": A paperclip A razor blade A safety pin A hairpin"

      "content": "Choose a needle \"magnetizer.\" You can magnetize your needle using a variety of methods: tapping it with a piece of steel or iron, rubbing it with a magnet, or rubbing it on another item that magnetizes it with static electricity. [2] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source A refrigerator magnet works well for this purpose. You can also buy plain magnets from craft stores. You can use a steel or iron nail, horseshoe, crowbar, or other household item if you don't have a magnet. The hair and fur shown in the photo should be ignored! To magnetize a piece of metal, only another magnet will do the trick. Rubbing it can electrically charge it - but not magnetize it."

      "title": "Magnetize the needle.",
      "content": "Magnetize the needle. Whether you're using a sewing needle or another metal item, rub the item with the magnet. Stroke the needle in the same direction, rather than back and forth, using steady, even strokes. After 30-40 strokes, the needle will be magnetized. [4] X Research source Use the same method for magnetizing the needle with silk, fur or hair. Stroke the needle with the item up to 50 times to magnetize it. Don't use these soft items if the needle you're using is a razor blade. If your magnetizer is a piece of steel or iron, tap the needle to magnetize it. Stick the needle into a piece of wood and rap the top of the needle 50 times."

      "title": "Insert the needle or place the needle in/on the cork.",
      "content": "Insert the needle or place the needle in/on the cork. If you're using a sewing needle, insert it horizontally into the edge of the coin-sized piece of cork, so that the needle pierces through the cork and comes out the other side. Push the needle through until the same amount of needle protrudes from either side of the cork. [5] X Research source If you're using a razor blade or another type of needle, simply place it on top of the cork so that it's evenly balanced in the middle. You may need a larger piece of cork to hold the razor blade. Any small item that floats can be used in place of the cork coin. If you're in the wild and in need of something on which to float your needle, you can use a leaf."

      "title": "Float the compass.",
      "content": "Float the compass. Fill a bowl or jar with a few inches of water and place the compass on the water. The magnetized needle will align itself with the earth's magnetic field to point north to south. [6] X Research source If a breeze hits the compass, it may have trouble aligning itself north to south. Try to shield the compass from wind by using a deeper jar or bowl. Currents will also disturb the direction of the compass, so you can't expect to get an accurate reading if you suspend it in a lake or pond. You might be able to use a still puddle."

      "content": "Assess whether the needle is magnetized. The needle and cork or leaf on which it is situated should slowly spin either clockwise or counterclockwise to point from north to south. If it doesn't move, rub or tap the needle again to magnetize it. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Figure out which way is north.",
      "content": "Figure out which way is north. Since the magnetized needle points from north to south, you can't use it to figure out where east and west are located until you know which way is north. Use one of the following techniques to get a sense for which direction is north , then mark that side of the compass with a pen or pencil so you can use it to navigate in other directions: [8] X Research source Read the stars. Locate the North Star, the last star in the handle of the Little Dipper constellation. Draw an imaginary line from the North Star to the ground. The direction of the line is due north. Use the shadow method. Place a stick upright in the ground so you can see its shadow. Mark the spot where the tip of the shadow falls with a rock. Wait fifteen minutes, then mark the shadow's tip with a second rock. The line between the rocks is roughly east to west. If you stand with the first rock on your left and the second rock on your right, you are facing north."
