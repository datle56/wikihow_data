    {
      "title": "Purchase unpeeled garlic.",
      "content": "Purchase unpeeled garlic. Buy as many heads of garlic as you'd like to make. Try to buy solo garlic, which is a single, large clove of garlic, instead of several cloves separated by papery skin. Although you can use standard garlic, it may be easier to use the black garlic if it's a single clove. [1] X Research source Some grocery stores may call solo garlic \"pearl garlic.\" Discard garlic that's cracked or has already started to sprout from the top because these will be bitter."

      "title": "Wipe the outside of the garlic with a damp paper towel.",
      "content": "Wipe the outside of the garlic with a damp paper towel. Because you're not going to peel the garlic before it ages, ensure that it's clean and free from dirt. Dip a paper towel in water and wring out most of the liquid. Then gently brush the outside of each garlic head to remove the dirt. Discard any heads of garlic that feel mushy or are rotting."

      "title": "Place a small rack and paper towel in the bottom of a rice cooker.",
      "content": "Place a small rack and paper towel in the bottom of a rice cooker. Set a rice cooker on the counter and put a small rack in the bottom of the cooker. You can use a bamboo rack or mat. Then place a paper towel on the rack. [2] X Research source Your rice cooker needs to have a lid that seals shut and a Keep Warm setting. If you don't have a rice cooker like this, use a slow cooker on the low setting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the garlic on the paper towel.",
      "content": "Put the garlic on the paper towel. Arrange the cleaned heads of garlic on the paper towel in the rice cooker. You can put as many heads of garlic in as you like since they don't need to be in a single layer. [3] X Research source Because it takes so long to age black garlic, it's a good idea to make a large batch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay a paper towel on the garlic and close the rice cooker.",
      "content": "Lay a paper towel on the garlic and close the rice cooker. Lay 1 or 2 paper towels over the heads of garlic so they're covered with the paper. Then close the lid of the rice cooker and press down firmly so it's secure. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Heat the garlic on the Keep Warm setting for 10 days.",
      "content": "Heat the garlic on the Keep Warm setting for 10 days. Turn the rice cooker on to the Keep Warm setting, not the rice cook setting. Leave the garlic to warm for 10 full days. To keep track of the days, consider sticking a note on the cooker with the final day listed. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that making black garlic in the rice cooker will permanently make the cooker smell like garlic. Some rice cookers have an Extended Keep Warm function. If yours does, use this or you'll need to repeatedly turn the machine back on. Read your manufacturer's instructions to determine the safest way to leave the machine on for 10 days."

    {
      "title": "Remove the garlic heads once they're black and dry.",
      "content": "Remove the garlic heads once they're black and dry. Open the rice cooker to check the garlic. Peel a head of garlic to see if it's completely black. Squeeze the garlic so you can tell if it's dry. Turn off the rice cooker and take out the garlic once the heads are firm to the touch and black. If the heads of garlic are still moist and a little squishy, leave them in the rice cooker on the Keep Warm setting for up to 4 more days."

    {
      "title": "Store the black garlic in an airtight container for up to 6 months.",
      "content": "Store the black garlic in an airtight container for up to 6 months. Once the black garlic is cool, put the unpeeled heads into an airtight container. Place the container in the pantry and use the black garlic within 6 months. [6] X Research source Avoid refrigerating the black garlic because this will introduce moisture that could cause the garlic to spoil."

      "title": "Blend the black garlic with oil to make a spreadable paste.",
      "content": "Blend the black garlic with oil to make a spreadable paste. Peel a few heads of the black garlic and put the garlic into a mortar. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of olive oil over the garlic and pound it with the pestle until you get a smooth paste. Blend in more olive oil if you'd like a thinner consistency. [7] X Research source To use the paste, spread it on crostini, whisk it into salad dressing, or smear it on chicken before you roast it."

      "title": "Dehydrate the black garlic and grind it to make a seasoning powder.",
      "content": "Dehydrate the black garlic and grind it to make a seasoning powder. Peel several heads of garlic and place the cloves on the rack of a dehydrator. Dehydrate the black garlic at 140 °F (60 °C) for 24 to 36 hours or until they're completely dry and they feel light. Then grind them in a food processor until you have a fine powder. [8] X Research source Add black garlic powder to marinades, spice rubs for beef, or pasta sauce."

      "title": "Slice the black garlic to scatter over salad or pasta.",
      "content": "Slice the black garlic to scatter over salad or pasta. If you'd like to add a burst of black garlic's savory-sweet flavor, slice the peeled black garlic as thinly as you can. Scatter a few slices over your favorite cooked pasta or tossed salad. The black garlic makes a striking garnish, especially if it's on a pale pasta, such as fettuccine alfredo."
