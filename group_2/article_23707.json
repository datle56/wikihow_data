      "content": "Test your iron levels in your blood. Since ferritin is iron that has been absorbed in your tissue, the first place your doctor will start is by checking how much iron is in your blood. This will give them a sense of whether you’re not consuming enough iron or may have a condition that inhibits absorption of iron into your blood.
