      "content": "The “lucky” is a single cigarette flipped upside down in the pack. If you take a look at someone’s pack of cigarettes and one of them is flipped so that the end you light is on top, that’s the lucky. Most smokers do this as a kind of playful ritual that doesn’t mean anything deep, while other smokers do this for genuinely superstitious reasons. The lucky is usually saved as the last smoke in the past. [1] X Research source Typically, smokers will designate a lucky cigarette as soon as they open a fresh pack of cigarettes. You can put a lucky anywhere in the pack, but smokers will typically flip one of the cigarettes in the front row. Smoking the lucky cigarette early is considered bad luck."

      "content": "Theory #1—World War 2 troops covering their tracks. Lucky Strike cigarettes have a stamp on one end. When US troops would get Lucky Strikes in their rations, they’d flip all but one of the cigarettes upside down in the pack so that they’d smoke the logo first. The theory is that if a fight broke out mid-smoke, soldiers could drop their cigarettes and the enemy wouldn’t know who was smoking them (only US soldiers received Lucky Strikes). [2] X Research source The story goes that US soldiers would leave the last un-flipped cigarette for a time when things were calm. World War 2 is where the phrase “smoke ‘em if you got em” comes from. Cigarettes were a part of every soldier’s weekly rations, and they’d famously run out before the next ration was available."

      "content": "Theory #2—Vietnam soldiers were celebrating survival. The second major theory behind the “lucky” cigarette is that Vietnam soldiers would flip one cigarette upside down and smoke it last as a way of celebrating the fact that they get to live long enough to smoke another pack. In this way, getting to the upside-down cigarette was a sign the smoker was lucky in combat. [3] X Research source Ever see a Vietnam soldier storing cigarettes in their helmet band in a movie? Soldiers would store smokes up there in case they had to wade through water. This way, the cigarettes would stay dry. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Theory #3—It developed as a reference to Lucky Strikes. This explanation seems much less likely given the lack of a record, but some people point out the “lucky” practice started at the same time as filtered cigarettes. Lucky Strike famously refused to put a filter on their main product (they still don’t to this day), so a “lucky” cigarette became a cigarette with no filter. By flipping a filtered cigarette upside down in the pack, it would look like a Lucky Strike because the tobacco would show (instead of the filter, which is usually at the top of the pack).

If you’ve got a big test coming up or you’re about to tackle a tough conversation with a significant other, break out the lucky and smoke it as a way to give yourself an extra boost."
