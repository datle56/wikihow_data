      "content": "Open the Snapchat app. Avoid clicking on any message notification in your Notification Center. This will take you directly to the message itself, which is something you’re trying to avoid. Half-swiping will only work on text Snaps, not image or video Snaps. Keep in mind that Snapchat+ users will see the \"eyes\" emoji if you half-swipe while they're in the chat window."

      "content": "Without letting go, slowly swipe to the right. This will reveal the message in its chat log. If there is more than one message, they will all show up here. Keep your finger on the screen at all times. Leave a small space between the chat log and the right edge of your screen to avoid releasing too early. Incorrectly done, this will open the chat and notify the sender that it's been read."

      "content": "Swipe back to the left when you’re finished reading. Make sure the chat log is swiped to the left before releasing your finger. If you release your finger before the chat log completely disappears, you will open the message and notify the sender. Successful half-swipes will still have the New Chat notification next to the sender."

      "content": "Half-swipe allows you to check Snapchat messages without notifying the sender. This trick is particularly helpful if you don’t want to reply to certain people but still want to see the message. Half-swiping also gives you time to think about your response before letting the sender know their message has been seen. For Snapchat+ users, half-swipes are indicated by the \"eyes\" emoji if they're on the chat screen.
