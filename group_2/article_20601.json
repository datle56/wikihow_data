      "content": "Aquarius guys like partners who stand out from the crowd. You don’t have to go crazy or be someone you’re not—just show him all the ways that you are your own person. Whether it’s your sense of humor, your job, your passions and hobbies, your educational background, or your style, be confident in who you are and show off your unconventional qualities too.

As the color of the ruling planet Uranus, blue is a common favorite color among Aquarius men. While he likes quirky styles, you don’t need to dress outrageously. Just make sure that you’re changing up your outfits regularly so he can look forward to finding out what you’ll wear each time you meet."

      "content": "Aquarius men love to solve puzzles, so keep him wondering about you. When you talk with him about your life, take it slow and reveal one thing at a time. Always save at least one story or an interesting detail about your life for the next time so that he’ll never stop trying to figure you out. When you build an air of mystery, you also build anticipation, which will get him to chase you. Keep building mystery by limiting the number of texts you send. Only text him once before waiting for him to respond (rather than following up with another three texts right away). Once in a while, you can catch his attention by not texting for a whole day. He’ll wonder what you’re up to, and his curiosity will likely make him text you first. When you’re talking, you could say things like, “Oh, I have so many stories about that! But I’ll save those for another day…”"

      "content": "Aquarius guys love to debate and explore other opinions. The only thing to remember is that he probably isn’t going to change his mind, and he’s not trying to change yours either—your guy wants a partner who will speak up and be different. When you and he offer differing opinions, talk them both through and then agree to disagree. That way, you both walk away satisfied! After a healthy debate, you could say, “Thanks for explaining your perspective! I hope we can agree to disagree here, but I’ll remember what you said the next time we talk about this.”"

Propose a spur-of-the-moment dinner at a new restaurant, or change your date plans at the last minute to something you know he hasn’t tried yet. The more you can surprise him, the more he’ll want to chase you. The key is not to let your relationship with an Aquarius guy get into too much of a routine. While everyone has some routine with jobs and obligations in life, you can keep your relationship interesting by breaking up the routine from time to time. Keep trying new things and making new memories with your Aquarius, and he’ll be hooked on your relationship. If you have an intimate relationship, ask him about what sexual fantasies he'd like to explore. However, don't feel pressured to do anything you don't feel comfortable with. Reader Poll: We asked 745 wikiHow readers and 60% agreed that making sure both partners are comfortable is the most important part of role-playing with an Aquarius man. [Take Poll]"

[4] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. Your Aquarius guy wants to feel like he has both a partner and a best friend.

The guy you like will have high levels of natural curiosity, so he’ll be happiest in a relationship that is mentally stimulating for him. [5] X Research source Keep his brain happy by engaging in thoughtful conversation with him about his favorite topics. Be open with your ideas and listen carefully to his, so that you can discuss them intelligently together. Keeping an Aquarius man mentally engaged is more about expressing your unique thoughts than it is about having the highest IQ. Be ready and willing to talk about anything, and he’ll be happy. Try texting him a news story to get him talking. “Hey, have you seen this yet? I’m curious to hear your perspective.” You could also share a favorite book or music album with him. “This book about world history is fascinating!

He’s probably used to being the “eccentric” one, but he may not be used to having someone who likes and accepts all of his different parts and pieces. Be someone he can depend on, and listen when he wants to talk over his big ideas with you. He’ll chase someone who can be a consistent source of positivity in his life. Let him know that you find him interesting and appreciate his quirks, and he’ll want to confide his hopes, dreams, and existential thoughts to you."

[6] X Research source You could invite him to a local protest. Let him see that you care about the world around you, and he’ll take notice. React to humanitarian issues on social media.

      "content": "Your crush values freedom more than any other sign on the zodiac. The less clingy you are around him, the more impressed your Aquarius man will be. Let him know that you’re interested, and then back off and live your own life (while still being friends with him, of course). He’ll see that you don’t mind spending time on your own and you will have a life outside of him no matter what. Keep up with your friends and family and work on having a rich social life to show off your independence. That will make him want to chase you. Focus on a new hobby. Pick an activity you can learn and hone your skills in, like drawing, a team sport, or a musical instrument—all of which your Aquarius will admire.

      "content": "Aquarius men want to keep their independence no matter what. Your guy is perfectly capable of committing to a partner, but not when he feels pressured to do it. Just as you need to show him that you’re independent, you also need to show him that you don’t mind him being independent too. Once he knows that you’re happy to let him be himself no matter what, he’ll chase you eagerly. Try thinking in the present rather than the far future. It’s okay to plan a little, but bringing up marriage and extra commitments before he’s ready may spook your Aquarius man. Be patient as your relationship develops. It might take time for him to decide that he wants to make more commitments to you, but giving him the time to figure it out will make him want you all the more."
