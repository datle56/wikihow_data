There are numerous privacy features that allow you to control who can send you direct messages and friend requests. Parents can also use Family Center to monitor what servers their child joins, as well as who sends them direct messages and friend requests. As with any social media or communications platform, there is always a risk that your child may be exposed to inappropriate material or shady people.

However, it is the parent's responsibility to determine if their child is mature enough and has enough of an understanding of online safety to use apps like Discord on their own. Despite the rules, there are children under the age of 13 who use Discord."

Children will not be allowed to enter servers that have an age restricted label. Adults will also be notified that the server contains adult content and they will be asked if they want to continue. [2] X Research source Even though Discord has age-restricted servers, kids can easily bypass the age-restriction by entering the wrong birthday when they create an account. If you decide to allow your kids to use Discord, you should create their account with them so that you can make sure they do it right. If you are over 18 and locked out of age-restricted servers, you will need to submit an appeal and include a picture of a photo ID. You can submit an appeal here . [3] X Research source"

According to computer expert Luigi Oppido, parents are never going to be able to lock down everything completely. Kids can find ways around parental controls. Parents need to talk to their kids about what kind of personal information they should and should not share online. Make sure they understand the dangers of online predators and that they know not to talk to strangers online or in real life. Make sure they know never to meet with someone they met online in real life without supervision from their parents."
