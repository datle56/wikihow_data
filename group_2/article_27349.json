Allow the seeds to soak for at least 6 to 8 hours, preferably overnight. You don't have to do this if you are in a hurry, but it will help the seeds release more gel. [1] X Research source Flax seeds produce a gel that works wonderfully on curly, coarse or frizzy hair. It adds shine and tames flyaways. Flax seeds are available at most grocery stores and health food stores. Make sure you get raw, unflavored flax seeds that have not been toasted or flavored with spices."

Stir the seeds often as they cook so that they don't stick to the pot. [3] X Research source The longer you cook them, the thicker the gel becomes, which will increase holding power. For something with medium-holding power, try 4 minutes; the gel will have a honey-like consistency. [4] X Research source If you have curly hair, you may find it easier to apply a looser gel."

Scrape the seeds against the strainer with a wooden spoon to help press out the excess gel, then lift the strainer away. Discard anything left in the strainer. [5] X Research source"
