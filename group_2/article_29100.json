Off tastes in your water, such as chlorine, iron, or sulfur will make your tea noxious to smell and drink. Fill an empty kettle with 1 cup (250ml) fresh, cold water. Tap water is acceptable for most purposes, but a truly great cup of tea starts with filtered water or spring water. Never use distilled water, or previously-boiled water. The more oxygen in your water, the better the tea will taste. [1] X Research source"

Some teas are steeped with boiling water, while some are steeped in water that's slightly cooler. Experiment with your tea to find what works best."

Some believe adding milk before the hot water is best, others feel tea brews best in hot water, and don't add milk until the tea is done steeping."

[3] X Research source About one minute for green tea. Three to six minutes for black tea. Six to eight minutes for Oolong teas Eight to twelve minutes for herbal teas. Note: if you like stronger tea, don't steep longer—add more tea, instead."
