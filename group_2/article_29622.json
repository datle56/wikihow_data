Release the mouse and click the small icon that pops up next to the numbers. Click “Charts” and then click “Pie Chart” to generate a pie chart. [1] X Research source"

Click the 3 bars with the word “Chart” at the top of the page. On the left side of the window, click “Pie” and select what style you want your chart to be. A new window will pop up with a sample set of rows, colors, and a title. [2] X Research source Edit each label by changing the words to reflect what your data represents. Click the title of the chart to edit it so that it reflects the subject of your pie chart. Replace each number next to each label so that it reflects your data. Any pie chart made in Excel or Word can be copied and pasted into PowerPoint. The pie chart that you make in Word will look identical to the pie chart that you make in Excel."

Search online to find a free website that lets you customize your design and enter your own values. You may need to create a free account on some sites to download the chart directly, but you can always use a screenshot program to take a snapshot of the chart. [3] X Research source Two of the most popular chart-making tools online are https://www.meta-chart.com/ and https://www.onlinecharttool.com . They let you control a variety of design elements and enter your own information. To use Meta-Chart, click “Pie Chart” on the main screen. Select your style, border, and background color. Click the “Data” tab to enter your numbers and the “Labels” tab to enter the name for each data point. Click “Display” to generate your chart. To use Online Chart Tool, select “Pie” from the dropdown menu at the top of the screen. Select your appearance, colors, and design. Hit “next” to enter your labels and data points. Click “next” and select your font. Click “next” one more time to generate your chart."

Directly underneath it, write the next-highest number. Give each number its own row to make a column of data points. [4] X Research source For example, if you were making a pie chart of the number of animals on a farm, you would list 24 cows at the top, followed by 20 pigs, and 6 chickens."

Place each label directly next to its corresponding number on the same row as the number. This will make it easier to keep track of what each number represents. [5] X Research source For example, you would write “cows” next to 24, “pigs” next to 20, and “chickens” next to 6. You could also use small drawings to represent each animal or abbreviate them with “C,” “P,” and “Ch.”"

Write the sum of your data underneath horizontal line to find your denominator. This number is what you’ll divide each data point by to get a decimal. [6] X Research source A denominator is a math term for the number that goes below a fraction line. The idea here is that you’re going to divide each individual number in your data by the denominator to get a decimal. This will show you what percentage of the sum each data point is. You will multiply each decimal by 360 to determine how big of a section it deserves on the pie chart. For the pie chart about farm animals, you would add 24, 20, and 6 together to get a total of 50. This would be your denominator."

Each number should be under 1, and the numbers in the new column should also be in descending order with the highest number at the top and the lowest number at the bottom. [7] X Research source If any of your numbers come out to be more than 1, something went wrong. Each number should be a decimal. For the farm animal pie chart, 24/50 = 0.48 cows, 20/50 = 0.4 pigs, and 6/50 = 0.12 chickens."

Write each result next to the decimal so that each set of numbers remains on the row as the original data that it corresponds with. [8] X Research source You may need to round the numbers up or down to get them to even amounts. For example, you may need to turn 56.6 into 57. Unless you’re creating a specific type of pie chart that requires smaller calculations, keep it to whole numbers to make your chart easier to read. For the farm animal pie chart, 0.48 cows x 360 = 172.8, 0.4 pigs x 360 = 144, and 0.12 chickens x 360 = 43.2. Round 172.8 up to 173, then round 43.2 down to 43."

If it’s 361 or 359, you may have rounded a number down or up in the wrong direction. If the numbers are way off, you've missed something and should double-check your work to see where you went wrong. [9] X Research source In the example, 173 + 144 + 43 = 360, so you know that the angles will complete a full circle for the pie chart."

Press the other needle into the point that you want to make the center of your circle. Rotate the pencil around in a circle while holding the needle still to make a perfect circle. [10] X Research source If you don’t have a compass and don’t mind a possible imperfection, you can use any perfectly round object, like a lid, cover, or bottle, as a straight edge and trace around it. You can use a pen if you want, but you’ll have to start from scratch if you make a mistake."

Pull the pencil straight down towards the needle after loosening the hinge to create a radius. Depending on the style of your compass, you may need to put a dot in the center after moving the needle then draw the connecting line yourself with a straight edge. [11] X Research source The straight line can be vertical (12 or 6 o'clock on the clock face) or horizontal (9 or 3 o'clock on the clock face). The segments you create then follow either a clockwise or counter-clockwise sequence."

Find this number on the outside of your protractor and make a hash mark. Then, draw a straight line from the hash mark to the center of your circle. Make each new line that you make the 90-degree center for the next section that you calculate. [13] X Research source For example, if you were making the farm animal pie chart, your first number is 144. Add 144 to 90 to get 234. Make a hash mark at 234 degrees and then make your line. Rotate the protractor and use the line you just made as the new 90-degree mark. The next data point is 43 degrees. Use the line you just made and add 43 to 90 to get 133 degrees. Make a hash mark at 133 degrees and draw the line to the center. Your remaining section will be 173 degrees. You can use the base of the protractor and skip the step where you add a number to 90 if you want. You’ll have to draw at an angle though and it can be easier to make a mistake if you do this."

You could even use a pattern, like a cow’s spots to represent cows!"
