      "title": "Ask the person how much space they need, if possible.",
      "content": "Ask the person how much space they need, if possible. Try to set a specific time frame for how long you’ll be apart, even if you just set a day to check-in with each other. Additionally, ask them what they expect from you, like limiting communication or avoiding each other in public. This empowers you to meet their needs and prevents miscommunication that could hurt the relationship. [1] X Research source You might say, “I really want to give you the space you need. Can you tell me what space looks like for you so I know what you expect?” For instance, they might want you to stop all contact for a few days. This might include texting, social media, and in-person conversation. However, they may be okay with an occasional text as long as you give them time alone."

      "title": "Tell the person that you’re giving them space because you care.",
      "content": "Tell the person that you’re giving them space because you care. One of the pitfalls of giving someone space is that they can start to think you don’t care about them. This puts you in a tricky position because they’ll be unhappy if you bother them, as well. To make sure you’re both on the same page, explain that you’re going to back off only until they’re ready to get close again. Clinical psychologist Lena Dicken says that openness is key, and is the best policy. [2] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. Say, “You’re really important to me, and I can see that you need some space right now. I’m going to give you the space you need, and I hope this will strengthen our relationship in the long-term.”"

      "title": "Stop calling and texting the person while you're giving them space.",
      "content": "Stop calling and texting the person while you're giving them space. In most cases, you’ll need to give them several days or possibly weeks of space, depending on what happened. During this time, don’t call or text them more than you agreed. If you do, they’ll feel like you aren’t respecting their wishes and may become more upset. [3] X Research source If you can, ask them what they’d prefer. Say, “Do you want me to stop texting and calling until you contact me first?” Giving someone space doesn’t just mean spending time away from them. If you’re texting them, you’re not giving them space."

      "title": "Stay off their social media accounts.",
      "content": "Stay off their social media accounts. You probably want to know what they’re doing, and that’s understandable. However, it’s harmful to both of you if you’re stalking their social media page. Not only will it make you more anxious, it may also make them feel like you’re hovering over them.

      "content": "Avoid places you know they frequent so you won’t run into them. You might not be able to completely avoid them, especially if you live together or attend the same school. However, do your best to stay away from places they might be, such as their workplace or their favorite restaurant. This will help you avoid awkward encounters that might make them feel uncomfortable. [5] X Research source For example, let’s say you know the person likes to pick up coffee from the same coffee house every day. If they see you there, they might assume that you ran into them on purpose."

      "title": "Avoid asking them what they’re doing or monitoring their activities.",
      "content": "Avoid asking them what they’re doing or monitoring their activities. When someone asks for space, they need time to explore their independence and decide what they want from the relationship. If you demand to know everything they’re doing, you’re not giving them the independence they need. Let them do what feels right to them without telling you the details. [6] X Research source You might be tempted to ask, “Who will you be seeing?” This kind of question will make them feel like you aren’t respecting their need for space. Don’t try to set rules, like who they can see and what they can do during the separation."

[7] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 4 June 2023. Keeping that channel of communication open makes sure that there’s always an opportunity to reconnect, when the person feels ready.

      "content": "Don’t take it personally. Everyone needs space, even you! If someone asks for space, it’s not because they dislike you or are angry. Rather, they just need room to be their own person and explore other things. Family therapist Allen Wagner says that not having that space can feel “like a pressure cooker.” [8] X Expert Source Allen Wagner, MFT, MA Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. That’s why getting offended or taking it personally can just add to the pressure and worsen the situation."

      "content": "Allow yourself to feel your emotions, but don’t act on them. Spending time away from someone you care about is really difficult. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, or worried. Acknowledge how you’re feeling and express your emotions in a healthy way , like journaling or making art. However, don’t act on your feelings because it will likely make things worse. [9] X Research source For instance, you might say to yourself, “Right now I feel really sad because Alex is my best friend and I might lose her.” This can help the emotion pass. On the other hand, it’s not a good idea to call Alex and cry about how upset you are. That’s not giving her space."

Instead of worrying about what they’re doing, use this time to do social activities that are important to you to get your mind off it . Spend time with your friends, join a club or a sports team, take a class. Fill your free time with fun things that will keep you occupied and help you meet new people.

It’ll only make you more miserable and might make you reach out too soon. Do something to occupy your mind, like reading, playing a game, or watching a documentary.

[17] X Expert Source Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 4 June 2023. A healthy relationship allows both people to grow, pursue their own interests, and enjoy other relationships. Talk to the person so you can decide what each of you need to feel fulfilled in your relationship. Then, change your old patterns so you both are able to stay independent and happy. In a romantic relationship, this might mean you both need a few evenings every week to pursue personal hobbies or spend time with friends. In a friendship, it could mean that you both respect that you have other friends and that you don’t hang out with each other’s exes. If it’s a family relationship, like siblings, this might mean respecting personal space, giving each other time alone every day, and asking before you use each other’s things."

Discuss what you both want to help you decide what good communication will look like for your relationship. As an example, you might talk in person a lot if you live together, but you may prefer to text several times a day if you spend a lot of time apart. If they want to communicate less often, respect their wishes. That might mean giving them some time to unwind when they get home, or letting them start conversations more often, rather than always being the one to initiate."

[19] X Expert Source Elizabeth Weiss, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 26 July 2019. Having space and time to yourself also prevents relationship burnout, which is when you get frustrated with someone after spending too long with them. Also, if you’re only ever spending time with one person, you don’t have as many opportunities to broaden your own horizons and become a more well-rounded and enriched person. When two people have room to be their own independent selves, they also have more to talk about and appreciate about each other."

Maybe they feel suffocated and are now avoiding you, or maybe something happened but they don’t want to talk about it. In either case, they’re pushing you away to think things through for themselves, and trying to get space so they can handle it. If someone feels like they’re drifting away, it’s best to tell them you’ve noticed, but without pressuring them, which might just push them further. For example, say, “I’ve noticed things seem weird between us. I don’t want to push it, but just know that you can tell me anything. I want the best for you.”"
