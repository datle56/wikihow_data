      "title": "Practice good hygiene.",
      "content": "Practice good hygiene. Generally, people like to kiss people who are groomed and have clean teeth. [1] X Research source You want to look presentable! If you are a crunchier person, don’t worry about the grooming as much. There is a nobility in cutting down on water usage and hygiene product production that some will find more attractive than clean hair."

      "title": "Try a new activity together.",
      "content": "Try a new activity together. Experiencing something new activates adrenaline and heightens awareness, which together make meaningful memories and can help you create a stronger bond with your special someone. [2] X Research source Try going bouldering, a form of rock climbing that doesn’t require a harness. Don’t worry—the walls are pretty short! If there’s a restaurant or bar you’ve both been wanting to try out, go together."

      "title": "Get them alone.",
      "content": "Get them alone. While some people certainly do kiss in public places, not everyone loves PDA, especially for a first kiss. Talk about pressure! If you’re at a party, you could ask if your partner wants to go on a walk or to talk in a different room. Say something like, “It’s so noisy and crowded in here! Want to go get some fresh air?” It can be scary to ask someone out first, but if you’ve been crushing on this person and never gone on a date, it’s important that they know you’re interested. Ask them if they want to come over to watch a movie, just the two of you."

    {
      "title": "Create an intimate environment.",
      "content": "Create an intimate environment. This will vary based on where you are and what your evening plans look like. The most important thing is to be warm and approachable. It’s easy to be standoffish if you are nervous, but no one will try to kiss you if you are. If you want him to make the move, you have to help them feel confident that you are open to it. Make sure to smile! Just as your other half needs to feel that you’re approachable, they also need to know that you’re enjoying yourself with them. [3] X Research source If you invite them over to your house for dinner or a movie, make sure the space is clean and the air smells inviting. Atmosphere is everything."

      "title": "Break the physical barrier.",
      "content": "Break the physical barrier. If you really like someone and feel nervous when you’re with them, you might subconsciously box yourself off from them accidentally. Don’t do this! Of all flirting techniques, physical touch works best. [4] X Research source Always start with light touching. Gently touch their arm when they say something funny. You want them to know that you are OK with physical touch. The idea is to build up the level of intimacy so you're both comfortable before moving in to the kiss. Reader Poll: We asked 2438 wikiHow readers who've kissed girls, and only 8% of them agreed that the best sign a girl wants to be kissed is when she touches their arm or leg. [Take Poll] Breaking the physical barrier is important, but it might be a good idea to be more direct if you want them to get the hint!"

      "title": "Make steady eye contact.",
      "content": "Make steady eye contact. You can hint at them by making eye contact and occasionally looking down at his lips. They should pick up on the fact that you are imagining what it would be like to kiss them. [5] X Research source Don’t go too overboard with this. If you’re not in conversation, don’t stare them down or they will find it creepy. If you’re sitting down watching a movie you can occasionally look over at them. Let them catch you looking, then turn back to the movie. They'll know you’re thinking of them."

You can say, “I’m so glad we’re finally on a date together!” People love hearing that they’re wanted. Get them to ask what you’re thinking about. If you’re feeling bold, say, “Oh, I’m just wondering what it would be like to kiss you.” [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Play fight. If you can find a natural way to initiate it, play fighting can lead to a kiss—think of The Lion King! It’ll increase your adrenaline, it gets you close to each other, and it shows that you feel comfortable with them. Just make sure that it is playful, not violent. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Tell them you’re nervous.",
      "content": "Tell them you’re nervous. If they know that you like them enough to be nervous, it will make them feel more comfortable. No one likes to be vulnerable, and if they don’t know that you’re feeling nervous too, they might be too afraid to make their move. For example, you could say, “I’ve been wanting to spend time with you for a while. I didn’t think I’d be so nervous!”"

      "content": "Ask them to kiss you. If all else fails, you can tell them that you want them to kiss you and see what happens. Sometimes guys fail to pick up on the hints and you need to be more direct. You could say, “I’d really like for you to kiss me right now.” If you want to be slightly less direct, you can say, “It would be OK if you kiss me right now, if you want to.” Don’t rush into this. Enjoy the beginning of the relationship, and if it’s been several weeks and you’ve dropped hint after hint, just tell them. They may be looking for your OK to go ahead, or they may want to kiss you in their own time."
