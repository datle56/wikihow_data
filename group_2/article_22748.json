      "content": "Relax before and during your swim. A relaxed face and body muscles will help you hold more breath and breathe more effectively. Before you swim, loosen your limbs by shaking them out. Avoid clenching your teeth or jaw while swimming. Hyperventilation is the practice of taking several quick breaths before you get in the water. Hyperventilation does not help you hold your breath. In fact, it can cause you to lose oxygen more quickly and black out. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Exhale slowly as your face enters the water. You can breathe out through your mouth or your nose, though it is recommended to exhale through your nose. Bubbles will rise up to the surface in a steady stream. Continue to exhale until you begin to pull up out of the water. Each exhale should be twice as long as your inhalation."

      "content": "Come up to the surface when you need to inhale again. Let your mouth and nose break from the surface of the water. Inhale using your mouth. Your inhalation should only be half as long as your exhalation. For some strokes, such as freestyle, you should turn your face to the side to take in a breath. Alternate which side you breathe on. [4] X Research source For strokes like the butterfly or breaststroke, you should inhale by lifting your head up above your arms until your nose and mouth break the surface of the water."

      "content": "Inhale deeply from the bottom of your lungs. Count to 10 or 20 seconds as you inhale. As you breathe, your belly should expand. If it does, you are reaching the deepest part of your lungs. If your chest and shoulders move, you are breathing from the top part of your lungs. [9] X Research source Avoid hyperventilation, which is the practice of taking quick, small breaths before you submerge yourself. This practice can increase your chances of blacking out. If inhaling for 10 seconds is too much, start out by taking in as much breath as you can. Each time you do it, try to inhale for a second longer."
