      "content": "Wash the skin tear with warm water or sterile saline. Start by washing the skin tear and the surrounding skin with warm water. Alternatively, use a sterile saline wound wash, which you can find at most drugstores. Use your hand to gently wash the area. Do not rub or scrub the area, as this can cause more damage to the skin. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Avoid using a towel or cloth to wash the area, as this can irritate the skin tear further. Your hand and running water should work just fine. Make sure you clean the skin tear before you apply a new dressing or bandage to it. This will ensure no bacteria are present in the skin tear before you bandage it."

      "content": "Use a saline wound cleanser as an alternative to water. You can also apply a saline wound cleanser to the skin tear. The wound cleanser will contain water and antibacterial ingredients to help clean the area. Rinse the area thoroughly with the saline, and try to wash away any obvious dirt or debris.

      "content": "Allow the skin tear to air dry. This may take 10 to 20 minutes. You can also use a soft towel to pat the area dry, being careful not to rub or scrub the area. If you decide to pat the area dry, avoid using tissue, a cotton ball, or any other material that could leave fragments behind in the wound."

      "content": "Tuck the skin flap over the skin tear, if possible. If the skin flap is still attached to the skin tear, use a damp cotton swab or your clean finger to gently ease it back into place. You can also use tweezers or a gloved finger to do this. Putting the flap back in place will help the skin tear to heal properly. [5] X Research source Never cut off the skin flap."

      "content": "Cover the tear with a petroleum jelly pad to keep the wound moist. Petroleum jelly gauze (or petrolatum gauze) is a good option for skin tears as it will protect the wound and keep it moist so it can heal. Petroleum jelly gauze comes in strips. Use scissors to cut the gauze to fit the area. Then, apply the gauze over the skin tear, leaving a 1 in (2.5 cm) around the skin tear. You can get petroleum jelly gauze or other non-stick dressings online or at your local drugstore. Hydrogel dressings are also an excellent way to protect your wound and promote faster healing.

      "content": "Wrap the area with a kerlix bandage. Kerlix bandages are made of thick, stretchy gauze. They will help to protect the skin tear and keep it moist. Wrap the kerlix bandage over the dressing to hold it in place. Kerlix sticks to itself, so you probably won’t need to tape it in place. If you have to use medical tape to keep it from unwrapping, make sure you only stick it to the bandage and not to the skin. You can also hold the dressing in place with a stockinette, which is a tube-shaped bandage that fits in place without needing to be wrapped or taped down."

To help keep the wound clean while it heals, change the outer dressing (the kerlix bandage or stockinette) once or twice daily, especially during the first 3-4 days after the injury.

Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, change the dressing on the skin tear itself every 3-5 days, or more often if blood or other fluids are seeping through the dressing. [8] X Research source Lift the bandages off and away from the direction of the attached skin flap. Clean the skin tear with water before you apply a new bandage. While you’re changing the dressing, check the skin tear for any signs of infection, such as swelling, odor, pus, or heat coming from the wound. If you suspect the skin tear is infected, or it does not appear to be getting better, see a doctor."

This may be an option if the skin tear is severe and is at risk of infection. [10] X Research source The doctor will use a local anesthesia on the area before they stitch it up.
