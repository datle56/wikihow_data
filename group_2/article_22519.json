      "content": "Yes, “Hi All” is a grammatically correct email greeting. Using “Hi All” as a salutation or email greeting is common and accepted. How you address other people depends on what you prefer and the level of formality for the group you’re writing to. If you’re writing to a group that includes clients, bosses, or other important authority figures, a more formal greeting than “Hi All” might be more appropriate. [1] X Research source In a Forbes survey, it was found that 52% of respondents preferred “Hi/Hello everyone,” over choices like “Hi/Hello all.” [2] X Research source Some email writers drop the salutation altogether. However, this might not be appropriate to do when writing formally, and some people might think it’s less friendly than opening with a greeting."

      "content": "You can either capitalize the first word or both words in “Hi all.” There are no official grammatical rules for email salutation capitalization. Generally, you can choose the option you like best. However, some people recommend capitalizing all the words in the salutation (like “Good Morning”) unless it includes names or other personal addresses (like “Good morning, everyone.”). In that case, only capitalize the first word. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a comma after “Hi” or other greetings. Many people exclude punctuation altogether in email salutations. However, others say it’s more appropriate to place a comma after “Hi” or “Hello” because those greetings directly address the person who’s receiving the email. [4] X Research source When using “Dear,” there’s no need to include a comma before the recipient of the email because the word “Dear” is used as an adjective. [5] X Research source \"Hi, all\" would be correct in this case."

      "title": "End the salutation with a comma or leave it out.",
      "content": "End the salutation with a comma or leave it out. In an informal direct-address email greeting, the comma is more of a tradition than an essential grammar rule. [6] X Research source You could also use a period or exclamation point, or leave off the ending punctuation. The Modern Language Association advises adding a comma to the end of your greeting unless the body of your message runs into the salutation line. In that case, use a period. [7] X Research source You can either start your email with, \"Hi, all,\" or choose to leave out one or both commas if you're sending a casual email."

      "content": "“Hi All” is grammatically correct, but “Hi, Everyone” may sound more natural. Although it’s common and correct to say “Hi All” at the beginning of an email, some people prefer to say “Hi, Everyone” instead because it sounds better. Use “Hi, Everyone.” or “Hi, Everyone!” when you’re writing informally to a group of friends or colleagues. [8] X Research source When writing a formal email, try “Dear all,” or “Dear everyone,” instead. [9] X Research source You can also begin your message on the same line as your salutation to make your greeting seem even more conversational."
