      "content": "Make a slug home. For a habitat, you can use multiple things, such as a critter-keeper, a photo storage box, an old container, a mason jar, an old aquarium with a lid, and even clear plastic boxes from the dollar store. However, if you do use a plastic box or container, always remember to drill or poke holes in the lid, so your slug can breathe. Don't make the holes too big or your slug can, and probably will escape. [1] X Research source Make sure to have a smaller back-up habitat if one of your slugs gets sick or to transfer the slug to when you clean the habitat."

      "content": "Add leaves, rocks, and twigs and sticks. For the base of the habitat, add a layer of soil or dirt. It can come from a pet store or even from your backyard. Most snails owners usually layer the tank bottom. [2] X Research source For example, add a layer of garden pebbles or fish rocks to the bottom of the tank. On top of that, add soil or dirt, then add a thin layer of grass or leaves. [3] X Research source Always remember to add hide-out places, for when your slug gets scared!"

      "title": "Keep the habitat clean and appropriate for a slug's environment.",
      "content": "Keep the habitat clean and appropriate for a slug's environment. From daily, weekly, to monthly, slugs almost always need their habitats cleaned. Most pet owners also keep their slug's habitat outside because slugs can get loose very easily. Hourly/daily: Every hour (or two times a day minimum) use a spritzing bottle to spray down your slugs' habitat. This will keep the moisture your slug needs in the habitat. Weekly: Carefully clean your slug's habitat every two weeks. Place your snail(s) in your back-up habitat and add fresh soil or dirt, leaves, grass, and food. Monthly: Most pet owners let their slugs loose after about a month. This is not considered a major deal."
