Research is ongoing, but scientific studies do indicate that spending time in nature can actually improve your health. There's no wrong way to do this—take walks, hit the local trails, go fishing, visit a park or arboretum, or start a garden in your own backyard. Even sitting quietly outdoors is beneficial! The key is just to get out there and enjoy nature as often as you can.

A healthy diet boosts your energy, helps you maintain a healthy weight, and lowers your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

Plan your meals for the week ahead so healthy options are always within reach. Prioritize foods that are high-fiber, low-sugar, and low-salt. Reach for healthy fats in foods like fish, nuts, and avocados. Leafy greens like kale, broccoli, and cabbage are packed with nutrients. Avoid saturated fats, hydrogenated oils, refined sugar, and processed foods. Be sure to check nutrition labels for serving sizes; proper portioning is important, too.
