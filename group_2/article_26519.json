[1] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 19 May 2020. If you cut out about 500 calories daily from your diet and incorporate exercise, you'll lose about 1 to 2 pounds per week. That means, in about four months, you can lose around 16 to 30 pounds. Another way to decrease calories is by monitoring your portion sizes. Larger portion sizes may tempt you to eat more food in one sitting and, therefore, more calories than your body needs. Measure out a 1 to 2 cup (8 to 16 oz) total portion size per meal. This should leave you feeling satisfied-not overly full."

A well-balanced diet is one in which you eat foods from each and every food group most days. In addition, you follow the appropriate portion sizes and choose a wide variety of foods from each food group.

Snacks can give you a boost of energy, extra hit of nutrition or the fuel for a tough workout. You need to be smart about the type of snacks you choose, and when to eat a snack. If you're choosing to have a snack while losing weight, aim for a 150 calorie snack. This will help you stick to a lower calorie level overall and still allow you to lose a decent amount of weight within four months.

The protein and fiber combination can help give you some energy and keep you satisfied longer. Only snack if you truly need to or are physically hungry or if there is more than four hours between your meals. Avoid snacking out of boredom or stress. Smart snack options include: a small Greek yogurt, a piece of fruit and low-fat cheese stick, 1/4 cup of trail mix, one hard boiled egg or 1 oz of nuts and 1/2 cup of grapes."

Lifestyle activities are exercises that you already do as part of your typical day. For example, taking the stairs, walking to and from your car, walking to go get the mail or doing household chores. Many studies have shown that these activities are equally as beneficial to weight loss and overall health as planned or structured cardiovascular exercise. Try to think of ways you can increase your overall exercise. For example, can you park farther away from your office? Can you schedule in a 10 minute walk break or yoga session on your lunch hour? Can you take more stairs? These activities will get you moving more and help burn more calories throughout the day."
