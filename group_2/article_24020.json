      "title": "Install battens first, then lay your metal to maintain a gap.",
      "content": "Install battens first, then lay your metal to maintain a gap. This is the most popular installation method. It involves installing 2 by 2 in (5.1 by 5.1 cm) or 1 by 2 in (2.5 by 5.1 cm) boards in horizontal and parallel strips on top of the shingles. This creates a gap between the metal and shingles, which gives your roofing materials a margin of error when it comes to contraction and expansion from temperature changes. [1] X Research source This gap also keeps moisture from building up in between the layers of your roofing. If the metal roof ever leaks, the shingles will keep your roof safe if there’s a gap."

      "content": "No, you’ll need to remove the shingles first if they’re beat up or leaking. Many folks want to put metal roofing over shingles because the shingles need to be replaced and they think adding metal roofing will be cheaper. Unfortunately, this is the one scenario where you need to strip the shingles. A roofing contractor will need to strip the existing shingles, replace any damaged or decaying joists, and then lay the metal roofing over the bare framing. [2] X Research source If you install metal roofing over a damaged shingle roof, the added weight of the new roof may cause the shingles to weaken and collapse over time. If shingles are damaged, a contractor will need to inspect the surface underneath anyway, so the shingles will need to come off no mater which way you swing it."

    {
      "title": "No, but only if the shingles are in really good shape.",
      "content": "No, but only if the shingles are in really good shape. Underlayment is a layer of roofing fabric that goes on before you lay your roofing material or battens. It helps absorb moisture and prevents leaks from getting really out of hand. If your shingles are in really good shape, it’s not mandatory to install an underlayment over the shingles before you install battens or metal roofing. The most popular underlayment is 30# roofing felt. Some contractors will lay plywood over the battens and then nail the felt to that before installing the roofing. [3] X Research source This adds a lot of weight though, so this step is often skipped if the shingles are really thick."

      "title": "You should use an underlayment if you want an added safety measure.",
      "content": "You should use an underlayment if you want an added safety measure. Underlayment functions as a protective barrier. It absorbs moisture, prevents leaks, and protects the underside of your metal roofing. It’s also fairly inexpensive to have installed as well, so you aren’t losing much by having a contractor add an underlayment even if it isn’t strictly necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Nail or screw the underlayment and battens into the shingles.",
      "content": "Nail or screw the underlayment and battens into the shingles. If the shingles are in decent shape, lay out the underlayment felt flat across the old roof. [4] X Research source Use a nail gun or nail and hammer to secure the felt to the plywood underneath the shingles. [5] X Research source Then, nail 2 by 2 in (5.1 by 5.1 cm) or 1 by 2 in (2.5 by 5.1 cm) boards in horizontal, parallel rows along the roof. [6] X Research source If the shingles aren’t healthy, you’ll have to remove the shingles first. The batten installation is really the only component of the process that makes it different from a standard metal roof installation ."

      "title": "Lay out metal panels and secure them to the battens.",
      "content": "Lay out metal panels and secure them to the battens. You may need a crew for this. Haul the metal sheets up to the roof screw them to the battens or subroof to secure them in place. These sheets are typically pretty large and unwieldy, so it may take some time to line the seams of each sheet up to make the room symmetrical. [7] X Research source If the grooves on the metal panels aren’t flush when they’re laid side-by-side, you’ll need to cut them so that the seams match."

    {
      "title": "Install closure strips over the gaps and add the flashing.",
      "content": "Install closure strips over the gaps and add the flashing. Once the metal sheeting is in place, cover each seam where two sheets meet with rubber or foam closure strips. These will keep water from penetrating your roof. Then, flash the roof by covering the edges of your roof with drip edge, and the apex of the roof with a ridge cap. Secure the flashing by screwing it into the edging and/or battens under the roof. [8] X Research source Cover each screw or nail that you can see with a rubber grommet to protect the tiny gaps between the fasteners and the roof from letting water in. As far as roofing projects go, metal roofing is relatively easy and fast to install. It’s a lot easier to just lay metal sheets down next to one another than it is to lay individual shingles or securing rubber slate."

      "content": "You can if you have roofing experience, but it’s not recommended otherwise. Working on a roof is dangerous, metal roofing requires multiple people to install, you need special equipment to raise and install the sheets, and the consequences of a poor roof installation can be disastrous. All things considered, you’re best off hiring a pro here. [9] X Expert Source David Bitan Roofing Contractor & Maintenance Professional Expert Interview. 14 July 2020. If you’re an experienced roofer you can go for it, though! [10] X Research source Expect to spend anywhere from $15,000-60,000 on metal roofing depending on the size of the roof and the material you choose. Yes, it’s expensive, but you won’t need to repair your roof for at least 40-50 years! [11] X Research source You can try this without roofing experience if you’re just working on a shed or something small like that, and the fall risk isn’t particularly dangerous.

      "content": "It’s typically illegal to install roofing like this without a permit. You’re usually allowed to patch a roof or make minor repairs on your own without a permit, but you almost always need to have a permit to install a brand-new roof. If you’re considering doing your own roof, reach out to your local building department to file for a permit. [13] X Research source Depending on where you live, you may not legally be allowed to redo your roof if you aren’t a licensed contractor. [14] X Research source Roofing contractors often provide free quotes. Reach out to multiple contractors and meet with them to see what they’ll charge for the project. Make sure that they’re licensed with both the city and state!"

      "title": "The additional weight can be a concern in the long run.",
      "content": "The additional weight can be a concern in the long run. Your home was likely built to hold one roof. If your home isn’t brand new, it’s possible that your current shingles were installed over older shingles. If you throw a metal roof on top of that, you’ve got three layers of roofing material on a roof designed to hold one layer. Over time, as your joists, subroof, and shingles degrade, there’s a potential of buckling or damage. [15] X Research source The main reason this isn’t a giant concern on a single layer of shingles is that metal roofing is usually relatively lightweight. So long as you only have one layer of shingles and your home isn’t super old, this shouldn’t be a huge risk."

      "content": "Metal roofing tends to be expensive, and it’s kind of loud in the rain. Metal roofing can run $120-900 per square foot, which is quite costly. The good news is that it’s extremely durable and you shouldn’t need to replace your roof again any time soon! The other big thing owners notice is that they tend to make noise when it rains, but it shouldn’t be too loud when you’re inside. [16] X Research source The noise shouldn’t be particularly noticeable when you’re inside if you left the shingle roof on. There will be enough insulation to dampen the sound. If you want to save money on metal roofing, consider aluminum or galvanized steel. These are the cheaper options when it comes to residential metal roofing materials. [17] X Research source If you’re installing roofing on a shed or something small, go with corrugated steel. This will be the cheapest choice. [18] X Research source However, the most cost-efficient way of roofing is using asphalt shingles. [19] X Expert Source David Bitan Roofing Contractor & Maintenance Professional Expert Interview. 14 July 2020. Repairing the roof is very cheap because repairs usually do not last long. If the roof is more than 15 to 20 years old, it may be better to replace the entire roof.
