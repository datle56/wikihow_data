      "content": "Choose a gentle facial cleanser. Aging skin does not need harsh products like the ones teenagers often need to use, as there isn't usually any excess oil. If your cleanser is too harsh, it will be stripping your skin of its natural oils, and therefore drying out the skin and causing it to age more quickly. Look for ones that are aimed at your age group, or ones that describe themselves as gentle or moisturizing . Women should moisturize their faces any time before they wear make-up. It is still important to cleanse your face as you get older, as it removes traces of chemicals from your environment or any makeup which can cause aging if left on the skin."

Make sure that the product you decide on is rich and deeply moisturizing, unlike the ones you may have used in your younger years. And remember, moisturizing is not just for women, there are plenty of similar products on the market aimed at men.

The sun is one of the main things that causes premature aging, so dermatologists recommend that you should wear at least SPF 15 daily to avoid wrinkles, brown spots, and a dull complexion. As well as this, it will protect you from skin cancer. You can put sunscreen not just on your face, but on your chest and the tops of your hands if you're just going to be out in the sun for a little while. This will prevent those spots on your chest and hands. If you're going to really be out in the sun, though, then you'll need to put sunscreen all over your body."

For men, this will make you look better groomed and less scruffy allowing you to look good with age, and for women, this will hide this side effect of aging. Here are some things to keep in mind for each gender: Men: Keep your face clean shaven or neatly trimmed, and always trim your nose and ear hair. You can buy nose hair trimmers at your local pharmacy and it’s completely simple and painless to use. Letting this hair grow wild adds age and also makes you look more scruffy. Make sure to pluck those nose hairs too, if you want to avoid that old man look. Women: Facial hair can sometimes appear in women after menopause due to a change in hormone levels. To get rid of this , and therefore hide your age a little better, there are a few easy ways to keep it away including laser removal, waxing, depilatory/hair removal cream, and threading. Women should also make sure to keep their eyebrows looking pretty thick. As you get older, your eyebrows may start to thin out, so make sure to color them in with a pencil that matches the color of your eyebrows so you continue to look youthful."

There are dozens of make-up tricks that can help women make their features continue to stand out as well as to hide the signs of aging. The trick is to hide those blemishes while emphasizing your best features, such as your eyes. Here are some tricks to try: Make sure you use a creamy concealer. Any concealer that is waxy or that can get cakey can actually make you look older. Put a dab of blush at the height of your cheekbones, but don't use blush in the hollows of your cheeks. As you get older, your face will actually lose fat, and your cheeks will naturally get a little hollower. This can make you look a bit older, so there's no need to emphasize this further with too much blush. Start using brown eyeliner instead of black. As you get older, black will start to look too stark in contrast to the rest of your face. Brown will create more gentle frames around your eyes. Show off your lashes. As you get older, your lashes will naturally get thinner and will straighten out, so counteract that by curling your lashes or even wearing thickening mascara when you can. Minimize the drama around your lips. A nice pale shade of lipstick can be a great addition to your face, but don't line your lips too much or wear bright lipstick; your lips will thin out as you get older, and there's no need to overcompensate."

You could have professional whitening, or if you have problems such as decay, wonky teeth or stained teeth you could get these things treated. There are also over the counter whitening products which can also be effective, although you might want to talk to your dentist for advice beforehand. Teeth can give away your real age more than any other part of your body, so start early with your total teeth care routine."

However, many people want to get rid of grey hair, and there are many hair dyes on the market that can tackle it. It's best to choose a color that is fairly similar to what your natural hair color was so that it appears more natural. You could choose to get your hair dyed at a salon, or you could choose the cheaper option and buy an at-home hair dying kit. You must remember, however, that all hair dye is damaging to the hair, so avoid dying it too often, and use products designed to care for damaged or dyed hair. As a way of avoiding dying your hair too often, you can apply hair dye primarily to the roots where your real hair color is showing, leave it there for longer, and then work the rest through the hair for the last few minutes. Another alternative is to buy root touch-up kits that match the hair dye you used. Women should consider getting highlights along with dying their hair, to add a softer edge to their new look. Try using natural or organic hair dyes free from harmful chemicals. You will have better hair and it will be better."

You don't have to go for something ultra-trendy if that's not your thing, but getting a haircut that suits you better than your old one can make you look a decade younger. Here are some things to consider when you go for a new haircut: [3] X Research source Women : Consider getting bangs if you have a larger forehead and if they fit your face shape. They will make you look more youthful. Layers can also take years off the age you look. They'll make your hair look more textured, airy, and voluminous, and will get rid of that flat, stringy look your hair might be suffering from. Chop off your hair so it frames your face and falls above your shoulders. Cutting a few inches off your hair will make you look years younger. Just make sure you don't cut it too short so you end up looking like you're rocking the Grandma look. Men : Let your hair grow out just a bit so your features look less harsh. But don't let your hair get too shaggy or you'll look a bit more haggard and old. If you're going bald, consider shaving your head. This will make you look younger -- and sexier -- instead of just letting your bald spot show."

If you've been wearing the same things for the past decade, it’s time to update your wardrobe. If you don't know what to buy, try asking a friend or family member with good style to go to some shops with you, or if you are uncomfortable doing this, have a look in magazines and see what kinds of things you like on models in there and see how you can apply it to yourself. If you are still unsure, either go to a shop and ask a sales assistant for advice, or just go and pick up all the items of clothing you like the look of, even if you think they might not suit you, take them to the changing rooms and have fun trying new things.
