Using string, a level, and a tape measure, plot out the exact dimensions of your wall, enclosure, structure, etc. Having a solid blueprint in place will help your purchase the correct amount of bricks and help you design guidelines that ensure your bricks are laid level. [1] X Expert Source Gerber Ortiz-Vega Masonry Specialist Expert Interview. 10 March 2020 When buying bricks, remember to account for the mortar. Add roughly 1/2\" to the size of your bricks to make sure you get the right measurement. However, if the bricks you are buying has a \"nominal size,\" this means that the manufacturer has already added room for mortar. [2] X Research source Always buy 10-15 more bricks than you'll need -- some will inevitably break while you're working."

      "content": "Pour a concrete foundation if you do not have an existing slab, brick ledge, or footing to work on. This must be level and below the grade of the finished ground so that the brick is all you see when your wall is finished. Once it is set, lay a row of bricks out on a \"dry run\" to ensure that the foundation is the right size. The foundation should be the exact length and height of your brick structure. In general, your foundation should be roughly 1 foot deep before you add the concrete. The concrete needs 2-3 days to set, so you can use this time to set up your guides and round up supplies.

[4] X Expert Source Gerber Ortiz-Vega Masonry Specialist Expert Interview. 10 March 2020 To make them, take 2 long wooden boards and drive them into the ground right at the ends of your structure. Starting with the surface of your foundation, mark the height of each brick, as well as the space for the mortar, using a tape measure. Make sure that the two boards are marked equally so that you have a straight line to guide you as you lay the bricks. The architectural standard for brick is 3 ⁄ 8 inch (1.0 cm) mortar joint thickness on all sides. There are exceptions, of course, for queen, old Chicago, and custom brick."

Once you have mixed the masonry cement and started laying brick, you have to use all the mortar and strike your joints before quitting. Mortar will harden overnight, so only mix as much as you can manage. Once you're concrete foundation has set and you're ready to begin, you should place the following supplies close by so you can work efficiently: String and clamps/nails (to create guidelines). Mortar and a mixing bucket. Level. Brick jointer. Club hammer (to break bricks in half) Tape Measure. [5] X Research source"

If you do not lay out the first row of bricks dry, small adjustments will be difficult or impossible to do later, and may cause some noticeable imperfections. [6] X Expert Source Gerber Ortiz-Vega Masonry Specialist Expert Interview. 10 March 2020 You can also make marks on the foundation with a permanent marker and it will make laying down the first course of bricks and centering the bricks much easier. If you purchase new bricks that are 8 inches in length, make marks on the foundation every 22 centimeters. If you are re-using old bricks that are 8 1/4 inches in length, make marks on the foundation every 22.5 centimeters."

      "content": "Mix your masonry cement, or mortar. This can be done in a wheelbarrow for small projects, or a mortar box if you don't have access to a mortar mixer or cement mixer. Basically, to mix the mortar, you will use a ratio of three parts masonry sand (builders sand, if it is very clean), to one part masonry cement. Add water to the dry materials and mix to a consistency like pudding. Too dry, and it will be difficult to \"set\" the brick in the mortar bed, too wet and the brick will sag. If you are starting, you might find it easier to mix a small amount of mortar for just a few bricks; this way, you can add mortar or water, as you go to get the right consistency. If you put a small spatula in the bag of mortar, you can use it to add some mortar, mix, check consistency, then add some more, mix and check consistency. This way you can avoid a watery mix of mortar that lets the bricks sag unevenly."

This will allow you to grab mortar with your trowel as you work, and not have to move around too much. If you've planned correctly, you can also place stacks of bricks at regular intervals so that you can keep working smoothly. However, if you're only working on a small project, you may be fine with one pile of bricks and a bucket of mortar. Place a few shovels of mortar on each board, splashing the board first with water so the mortar \"keeps\", or stays wet enough to use. [7] X Research source"

Set a brick down in this \"bed\" of mortar, and tap it down with the handle of your trowel, until it is level, parallel to the line of your wall, and the edge is plumb. Repeat with 6 or 8 bricks, using the edge of the trowel to cut away the excess mortar that is shoved out from under the brick as you go. You can put the mortar on about an inch and a half thick, and then press it down to about a finger's width. Then wipe off the excess with your finger, giving it the classic indention look that you see on brick houses. In masonry, a course is a row of bricks."

You can use a level to check it's straightness. You'll be moving this line after every course of bricks."

The jointer is a piece of tubing whose diameter is the same or slightly larger than your joint spacing, bent in an \"S\" shape.

You can also use a wood dowel or a piece of 1/2 inch copper pipe. Both will give you a rounded pattern."
