Spray it enough so that the fabric is wet, but not soaking or dripping. If you need to starch a large amount of fabric, pour the starch into a bucket, tub, or sink. Dip the fabric into it, wring out the excess water, then iron it. You may need to double or triple the recipe. [5] X Research source Starch made from vodka and water may not stiffen the fabric as much as starch made from cornstarch, but it's less likely to leave white marks on your clothing, unless your water is very hard. In that case, use distilled water instead of tap water. [6] X Expert Source Lois Wade wikiHow Crafts Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020."

Stir the two together until the cornstarch dissolves, then set the cup aside. If you can't find cornstarch where you live, use cornflour instead ( not cornmeal). It's best to make small batches of this starch so it doesn't spoil. [7] X Expert Source Lois Wade wikiHow Crafts Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020."
