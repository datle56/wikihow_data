      "content": "Think about your crush throughout the day. Spend time thinking about your crush to affirm their presence in your mind. Daydream about the kind of scenario you'd like to dream about, such as a romantic walk on the beach or a fun date with dinner and a movie. Try meditating before bed to clear out other thoughts and conjure up a clear mental picture of them. Invite your crush into your brain, so to speak. [1] X Research source You can also create a vision board to organize your ideal dream and give your subconscious clearer, more realistic visual cues."

      "title": "Look at a picture of your crush right before bed.",
      "content": "Look at a picture of your crush right before bed. Once you've thought about them for a little while and laid out what you want to happen in the dream, solidify the entire routine by looking at a picture of your crush. This will give you an even more exact image of them in your head as you doze off. It’ll also give your mind something to focus on, which is proven to enhance your likelihood of controlling your dream. [2] X Research source Keeping a printed-out photo of your crush near your bed is a little intense. Try and find a picture of them on their Facebook or Instagram profile, your yearbook, or in your camera roll (it’ll be extra effective if you’re in this picture, too)."

      "title": "Say your crush’s name aloud as you drift off.",
      "content": "Say your crush’s name aloud as you drift off. When you’re getting ready for bed, say your crush's name out loud, followed by a positive, affirming statement. This statement can be simple (\"I will dream about Paul\") or more specific, using phrases such as: \"I want to dream about going on a date with Krupa.\" or \"I will dream about walking on the beach with Daisy.\" Stating a firm intention increases your likelihood of dream control. [3] X Research source Repeat your affirming phrase a few times before you fully concentrate on sleeping. Repetition is a key principle of dreams. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Fall asleep with your crush's image fresh in your mind. With your dream intentions laid out, relax and let yourself snooze. Having all of these visual and verbal cues will firmly concentrate your crush in your subconscious mind. This encourages your hippocampus (the part of the brain that governs imagining and dreams) to recall your crush’s face and the scenario you laid out before you fell asleep. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To fall asleep faster , try some progressive muscle relaxation exercises . Flex and release each of your muscle groups 1 at a time, starting with your ankles and working your way up to your neck. Inhale and tense your muscles for 5 seconds. Then, exhale and let the tension release so you’re nice and relaxed.

Not only does melatonin help control your sleep cycle, it makes your dreams more vivid.

Just keep at it, maintaining the following steps of visualizing, meditating, and verbally affirming before bed. It should eventually lead you to your ideal dream about your crush.

      "title": "Keep a dream journal.",
      "content": "Keep a dream journal. The first step to having a lucid dream , which is a dream where you know you’re dreaming and can control the events within, is to remember the dreams you typically have. Over the course of a few weeks, lay in bed every morning and replay your dreams. Then write down what you dreamed of the night before as soon as you get out of bed. This will help you recognize typical patterns in your dreams. [10] X Research source Also, make note of recurring themes or objects in your dreams. These can act as focal points in your dreams to help you become aware that you are dreaming. [11] X Research source Keep a notebook or journal right by your bed for the easiest access. This way, you won't have to go looking for somewhere to write your dreams down. The less distracted you are, the more you’ll remember.

      "title": "Notice the world around you (in your dreams and in reality).",
      "content": "Notice the world around you (in your dreams and in reality). Become hyper-aware of the conscious world, so it’s easy to tell when you’re dreaming. Ask yourself throughout the day if you are awake or not. Notice how all your senses respond to various things around you. Find elements in your everyday life that are detailed and in clear focus that you can use as comparisons for your dream landscape. Try looking at the details on the back of your hand. These details will be fuzzier in dreams, which can help you realize the distinction between dreams and reality. Try to do practical things, such as turning off the lights or speaking. Do these actions feel normal or weirder than usual? If they feel off, you’re probably dreaming."

      "title": "Eliminate distractions as you lapse into sleep.",
      "content": "Eliminate distractions as you lapse into sleep. Before bed, make sure you’re in a comfortable environment where you won't be disturbed. Lay down with your eyes closed and relax your body, letting all the ambient sounds and smells fade away. Think about the fact that you are awake and attempting to fall asleep. This will help you hold on to your conscious mind, even when you lapse into sleep and start dreaming. [13] X Research source You may not have lucid dreams right away. Just keep looking for your dream signs and logging your dreams. Eventually, you’ll recognize when you’re dreaming and become lucid. You may be pulled out of your first couple of lucid dreams as soon as you become aware. If this is the case, try looking at your hands in your dreams or spinning around in a circle. These things can help focus your senses and help you stay lucid in your dreams longer."

      "title": "Conjure your crush in your dream.",
      "content": "Conjure your crush in your dream. Once you've achieved lucid dreaming, you can manipulate the dream and bring your crush into the dream with you. While in your dream, visualize your crush right behind you or just around the corner. Once you've got a clear picture, turn around or go look around the bend to find them. You can also conjure a door and expect them to be behind the door. They should eventually be there when you open it. [14] X Research source If you do get your crush to show up, but they don't look quite right, you can manipulate the figure to change in your dream. Try saying something like: \"This isn’t the version of Connell that I know. I am going to turn around and when I look back, you are going to be the best version of Connell that I can imagine.\""
