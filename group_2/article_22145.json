      "title": "Be friends with your boyfriend or girlfriend first.",
      "content": "Be friends with your boyfriend or girlfriend first. Start a relationship from there. Hang out every now and then with him/her and a few other friends. Get to the point that you can openly talk to them about anything. Find someone who likes you. Do they like you for you and make sure you like them the way they are. Find common interests. Maybe you two love to play soccer. Or maybe you two are both choir nerds. You don't have to be a cheerleader-quarterback couple. Find something that you both can share an interest in!"

      "content": "Show affection. Hug, hold hands, go on cute dates, and maybe even a little peck on the cheek or lips on special occasions, but keep it comfortable and appropriate. If you're still trying to pursue them and you feel like holding hands or kissing, the best way may be to try to sit next to them and touch their leg or arm. You shouldn't go any further than a peck on the lips unless you're okay with it. Talk to them about what you want and are comfortable with."

      "content": "Look nice and keep yourself healthy. Just because you have them does not mean you can't lose them. This does not mean dress like a model every day. Just try not to wear a sweatshirt and sweatpants every day. Make sure your hair is orderly and clean. Make sure you take care of yourself and stay healthy and hygienic. Brush and floss your teeth and use mouthwash for fresher breath. Take showers daily and wash your face every day with a cleanser and moisturize. Brush your hair."

      "title": "Protect yourself.",
      "content": "Protect yourself. If you suspect something is wrong. If they are cheating break up, and just be friends. Do not go back if they aren't treating you well! You are not an adult just yet. This is a safe low-pressure environment to explore what you like and don't like in a person! It's okay to experiment; just be sensitive of their feelings. Take everything with a fat grain of salt. Don't listen to haters, rumor spreaders, and those immature preps asking \"Hey! Did you guys make out yet?\" But be wary about your partner's past, and signs your friends are seeing."
