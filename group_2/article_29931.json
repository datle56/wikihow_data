Place a band in Color 1 (this can be whatever color you want it to be) between the second peg in the middle row of the loom and the second peg of the right row. Next, in a clockwise motion, place five more bands, using the peg in the middle row as the center. This should make a star-burst shape (sometimes called an asterisk). Keep pushing all of the bands down as you go. This creates more room for later."

Add the clockwise bands again, in the same manner as with the first star-burst. You should have a new star-burst with a bottom that overlaps with the top of the first star-burst. Keep doing this until the whole loom is filled (inside the outer ring that you made in the first section). Push down the bands each time. You can change the colors of the bursts if you want to. They can each be a different color or they can be the same. It's up to you!"

Then do the same thing for all of the star-bursts on the loom. These should now look like a flower or a sun, if you did it correctly. Be careful not to dislodge the other bands on the pegs."

Starting with the band that goes around the bottom left and bottom center pegs, grab the end that's wrapped around the bottom center peg and pull it up (without dislodging the other bands). And then weave it over the bottom left peg, so that both ends of the band are on that peg. Then, do the same for the band which wraps around the bottom left and second to left pegs.

Add it to the chain you've started on the loom. Now, chain the bands from the end with the bracelet all the way down to the first band. In other words, hook the bottom band on the next peg after the base of the bracelet and pull it up and down to hook onto the third peg from the bracelet. Keep hooking and looping until a single chain is formed. You can also make other forms of extensions if you have another design that you like better. It only needs to be attached to the bracelet in this standard way."
