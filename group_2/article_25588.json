Rahman and performed by Javed Ali and Mohit Chauhan as part of the movie’s soundtrack that topped the 2011 iTunes international charts. The song represents both the Sufi tradition and the power of God’s love to change hearts. It had a big impact on pop culture by igniting an interest in Sufi music and spirituality. For example, the lyric Kun Faya Kun, Kun Faya Kun, Sadaq Allahul-alliyul-Azeem (“He said, Be, & it is! Be, & it is! The truth is Allah, the sublime, the magnificent”) emphasizes the boundless power of Allah and how anything he creates can come into being instantly. The lyric, Kadam Badhaa Le, Hadon Ko Mitaa Le, Aaja Khaali Pan Mein Pee Ka Ghar Tera, Tere Bin Khaali Aaja, Khali Pan Mein, Tere Bin Khaali Aaja, Khali Pan Mein (“Take a step forward, destroy these distances, come into this void, the home of your beloved”) is an attempt to be closer to Allah and celebrate the fact that anywhere you are, God is with you. Sufism is a mystical religious practice within Islam that focuses on making a spiritual connection with Allah in one’s life. Music is a powerful way that Sufis connect to God. “Kun Faya Kun” uses the Qawwali musical style used by Sufi mystics to spread love for Allah."
