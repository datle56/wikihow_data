For example, if you asked whether her track training was hard, she might say, \"Yes, but I love it!\" In that case, you could say, \"Cool! What do you love about it? I've always thought about getting into running, but it seems really hard.\" Make sure to use active listening when she talks. That means giving her your undivided attention.
