Make sure you're not using a different type of kitty litter, as it could ruin your phone. Place your phone in a bowl filled with 4 cups of crystal kitty litter, and allow it to dry for 24 to 48 hours. If you're using silica gel packets, you do not need to open the pouches. While it is common to use white rice, it is not as effective as you may think. You can use a large quantity (4-5 cups) of instant rice, but normal white rice will have little to no effect on drying your phone's speaker. Other options that may work include desiccants such as Israeli couscous and instant oatmeal."
