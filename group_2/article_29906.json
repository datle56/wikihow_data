You'll need to fit nine planets plus the sun into this, so make sure you have enough room. This should be at least as large as a men's shoebox, which is roughly 15\" x 10\" x 5½\" (36 x 25 x 13 cm)."

      "content": "Gather five polystyrene balls. If possible, find these in three different sizes. They should all fit in the box with a little room left over, although they don't have to squeeze in all in a row. You'll need: One large ball to make the sun (maximum 4\" / 10 cm across) Two medium balls to make Jupiter and Saturn (maximum 3\" / 7.5 cm) Two small balls to make Uranus and Neptune (maximum 2\" / 5 cm)"

      "title": "Choose your paints.",
      "content": "Choose your paints. Acrylic paint is your best option, since some other paints can dissolve polystyrene. Choose a variety of colors to paint your planets, including orange or gold, yellow, red, white, and dark blue. If you're not sure whether a paint works on polystyrene, check the label for brush cleaning instructions. If you can wash off the paint with water, the paint is water-based and safe to use. If you need to use a solvent like white spirit or turpentine, the paint is solvent-based and may dissolve polystyrene. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Paint the sun.",
      "content": "Paint the sun. Stick a long skewer into your largest polystyrene ball to hold it in place. Paint the entire surface with gold, yellow, or orange paint to make the sun. Place the skewer in a tall jug or stick the end in a polystyrene block and leave the ball to dry. A stenciling brush or other short-bristled brush will help you get the paint to stick into the nooks and crannies on your polystyrene ball. You might need to let the first coat dry and use a larger brush to paint over it for an even color. If the paint doesn't stick at all, cover the ball with a thin layer of spackle, let it dry, and paint over that. [2] X Research source"

They each have a diameter about ten times larger than Earth's, and are made mostly of a heavy layer of gas surrounding a rocky core. [3] X Research source Skewer these and place them in a polystyrene block or separate jugs, so the wet painted surfaces don't touch. Jupiter's clouds form bands and spiral storms. Paint this planet with red, orange, and white paint, swirled into patterns. Saturn is ivory in color (a mixture of yellow and white paint) with white and light yellow streaks."

      "content": "Paint the ice giants. Your last two balls will represent Neptune and Uranus, the smaller gas giants or \"ice giants.\" About four times the size of Earth in diameter, these planets formed from balls of ice and heavy elements. Since then these materials have turned into a fluid core, surrounded by a layer of swirling gas. [4] X Research source Paint Uranus a pale blue, made by mixing blue and white paint together. White clouds sometimes form over the solid blue atmosphere. [5] X Research source Neptune is almost the same color as Uranus, but looks darker because it's farther away and receives less light. Paint it blue."

      "content": "Add Saturn's rings. Find a drinking glass with an opening the same size as the ball you used to make Saturn. Put the glass down on gold or yellow construction paper and trace around it with a pencil. To make a ring shape, put down a larger glass over your pencil circle, and trace around that as well. Cut out this ring, then glue it around Saturn and let dry. Poke the hole through Saturn at an angle, so the rings will be tilted when the planet is hanging down. This will look better and give you a little extra room to arrange the planets. To cut out the ring, start by cutting out the larger circle. Fold the circle gently in half without creasing it, then cut around the smaller circle."

Roll five small balls (maximum 1\" / 2.5 cm across) using several colors of clay: Mercury is a brownish gray rock, with no cloud cover. You can make it out of red or gold clay instead for a prettier model. Make Earth out of blue clay for now. Make Venus out of pale yellow clay. Pluto is technically not a planet (it's too small), but it can sneak in anyway. Make it out of light brown clay, maybe with some charcoal mixed in to imitate its blotchy surface."

      "title": "Let the clay dry.",
      "content": "Let the clay dry. Follow the dry instructions on the clay packaging. Air dry clay dries on its own, while other types of polymer clay needs a low-temperature oven to harden. For light colored clay, it's a good idea to set your oven about 10ºF (~5ºC) lower than the instructions recommend. This can take twice as long to bake, but the chance of breaking is lower."
