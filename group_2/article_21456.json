      "content": "Consider buying a kit if it's your first time growing mushrooms. Mushroom kits normally have all of the materials that you need for planting and growing mushrooms, and are great for beginners. They usually contain manure, substrate, trays, and a spray bottle for watering the mushrooms. [1] X Research source Growing kits tend to have specific directions that may differ from traditional mushroom growing methods. Be sure to read the package carefully and follow the directions. Some kits already contain the spores for growing a specific type of mushrooms, while others just contain growing trays and appropriate substrate."

      "title": "Buy large trays for growing the mushrooms.",
      "content": "Buy large trays for growing the mushrooms. Select trays that are about 14 by 16 inches (36 by 41 cm) and at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep. To start out, only plant in one tray, which will continue to produce mushrooms for 3-6 months. Trays can be made of plastic, metal, or wood, depending on what you have available. As you become a more experienced cultivator, you can grow multiple trays at once and have an almost constant supply of mushrooms!"

      "title": "Make a mixture of equal parts compost and manure.",
      "content": "Make a mixture of equal parts compost and manure. Button mushrooms require a growing environment that contains a lot of nitrogen. Use your own compost and purchase manure, like horse or cow manure, at the store, or buy both if you don't have a compost pile. [2] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If you plan on growing a lot of mushrooms, you can make this mixture in a large bucket and cover it after you use some of it. Otherwise, only mix as much as you'll need to fill one tray. Your manure and compost mixture will produce a strong smell, so make it in a well-ventilated area."

    {
      "title": "Fill the trays with 6 in (15 cm) of the growing mix.",
      "content": "Fill the trays with 6 in (15 cm) of the growing mix. Pour the mixture into the trays carefully, leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top of the tray. Make sure the soil is level and is spread evenly across the tray. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source White button mushrooms tend to spawn well in warm compost, so don't worry if the compost is still hot when you place it in the tray."

      "title": "Purchase ready-made spores online or at a nursery.",
      "content": "Purchase ready-made spores online or at a nursery. To easily grow mushrooms, purchase spores that have already been “inoculated” or mixed in with a substrate, like dirt, hay, or sawdust. Button mushrooms are very common and available through online retailers, and can even be found in local nurseries. [4] X Research source Whenever possible, purchase spawn from an experienced mushroom cultivator. These spawn will be more likely to produce mushrooms."

    {
      "title": "Spread the spores on top of the compost and mist with water.",
      "content": "Spread the spores on top of the compost and mist with water. Since the spawn is pre-treated, you can apply it directly on top of the compost mixture. Try to make an even layer across the substrate so the mushrooms will grow in all parts of the soil. [5] X Research source Mushrooms like to grow in a damp environment, so even if the manure and compost are wet, spray the tray thoroughly with water."

      "title": "Place the tray on a heating pad to raise the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C).",
      "content": "Place the tray on a heating pad to raise the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C). Set the tray directly on top of a pre-heated pad that plugs into a wall and has a temperature control dial. Place a thermometer in the soil to monitor the temperature as it rises. [6] X Research source Avoid heating the soil any higher than 70 °F (21 °C) because it can kill the spores before they grow."

      "title": "Move the tray to a dark room, and spray with water 2 times per day.",
      "content": "Move the tray to a dark room, and spray with water 2 times per day. The mushrooms will grow best in a dark place, like a root cellar, basement, garage, or even a closet. Throughout the day, check the temperature and moisture of the soil to make sure it isn't too warm or dry. Spray the soil with water thoroughly 2 times per day. [7] X Research source If the soil is frequently warm, try lowering the temperature of the heating pad and keep an eye on the thermometer. Pro tip: If you want to ensure the mushrooms don’t dry out (which is really bad for their growth), cover the tray in plastic wrap to help lock the humidity in."

      "content": "Lower the heat to 50 °F (10 °C) once tiny, thread-like roots form. After 3-4 weeks, the top of the soil will be covered in tiny, white roots, called “mycelium.” When the soil is completely covered, lower the temperature to encourage growth of the first mushrooms. Some areas of the tray might form mycelium early, while others will take a full month. Be patient throughout the process, and wait until the colony is fully formed to lower the heat."

    {
      "title": "Cover the mycelium with 1 in (2.5 cm) of potting soil.",
      "content": "Cover the mycelium with 1 in (2.5 cm) of potting soil. As the temperature falls, spread a layer of regular potting soil over the newly formed roots. This layer will protect the delicate mycelium and provide nutrients for the new mushrooms as they grow. [8] X Research source You can find potting soil at most home improvement stores or garden centers."

      "title": "Water the soil daily and cover the tray with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Water the soil daily and cover the tray with a damp cloth. In order for mushrooms to grow, the environment has to be constantly moist. In addition to spraying the soil with water, drape a damp cloth over the tray to release water into the soil throughout the day. [9] X Research source If you don't have a cloth to cover the tray, you can use a layer of damp newspaper spread across the top of the soil. When mushrooms begin to form, remove the newspaper. Make sure to keep the cloth damp, as well, by misting it, or just running it under water for a few seconds."

      "title": "Wait 3-4 weeks for mushrooms to sprout from the soil.",
      "content": "Wait 3-4 weeks for mushrooms to sprout from the soil. About a month after spreading the potting soil, the first mushrooms should sprout from the soil. Allow them to reach full maturity before harvesting them to eat. [10] X Research source Once mushrooms begin to form, continue to mist the soil. A single tray of spores can produce mushrooms for 3-6 months after the first sprouts."

      "content": "Harvest the mushrooms when the caps open. When mushrooms are mature, the cap will pop open. Use a sharp knife to slice through the stem, just below where the cap meets the stem. Some gardeners choose to twist off the caps to avoid cutting the stem. [11] X Research source If you're not sure how to prepare your mushrooms, you can try sautéing them, making a cheesy mushroom pull apart bread, making mushroom gravy for chicken, or eating them raw!"
