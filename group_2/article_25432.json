You may need to track several of your dog’s heat cycles to confirm each stage. [8] X Research source Proestrus stage: Starts when the female dog’s vulva begins to swell and starts to spot. It is usually 9 days, but can last from 4 to 20 days. During this stage, your dog may attract males but not accept them for mating. Estrus stage: The period where the female dog can breed. This period usually lasts 9 days, and she is most fertile for the first 5 days of it. She will become more social with males and allow them to mate with her. You'll know the fertile stage is complete when her vagina returns to its normal appearance and she no longer seeks out or accepts mates. Diestrus stage: The end of her heat cycle. She will either return to normal or develop into pregnancy. Anestrus stage: An inactive phase. No changes in behavior or appearance will occur."
