Animals are also deeply tied to the creation stories of tribes and the personal stories of Native families. [16] X Research source Do not use sacred imagery to represent your spirit animal, such as totem poles or pictographs. This is cultural appropriation. Do not use the term “spirit animal” in connection to Native American spirituality. Their connection to animals differs from the modern, popular use of spirit animals.
