      "content": "Peel away any old weather stripping. Installing weatherstripping is a great way to cover a window or door for winter. If your door or window currently has weather stripping, remove it before you place the new piece down. If the old stripping is adhesive, pull it off using your hands. If it’s screwed into the frame, use a drill or screwdriver to take out the screws, then lift off the stripping. [1] X Research source Try using a putty knife to make it easier to peel away the old weather stripping. That will make it easier to scrape away tape and any small pieces. [2] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. If you removed any screws, set them aside so you can use them on the new stripping."

      "title": "Clean the door or window jamb with soap and water, then dry it.",
      "content": "Clean the door or window jamb with soap and water, then dry it. This removes any remaining residue or debris, which could affect how well your new stripping sticks in place. With a cloth, wipe down the entire frame of the door or window with soap and warm water. Use another cloth to dry off the frame. [3] X Research source If there are any small holes or cracks in the frame, load a tube of exterior caulk into a caulk gun, then pull the trigger to squeeze the paste into the hole. Let it dry for about 24 hours before applying your stripping."

      "title": "Measure the top and side of your door or window frame.",
      "content": "Measure the top and side of your door or window frame. Hold 1 end of a tape measure against the inside edge of the frame, then stretch it to the other inside edge to determine the length of the top and/or bottom piece of stripping. To measure the sides, place the end of the tape measure on the inside edge of the top of the frame and pull the tape down to the floor. [4] X Research source Measure twice to make sure you have the most accurate reading. It may help to have someone else read the measurement while you hold the tape in place."

      "title": "Select the type of adhesive weather stripping to use based on your door.",
      "content": "Select the type of adhesive weather stripping to use based on your door. The 3 most common types of adhesive weather stripping are foam, V strip, and rubber or vinyl. Adhesive-backed foam tape is the most popular, as it’s the easiest to install, but if you have a draftier door frame, you might prefer vinyl. Consider the specifics of your door or window when choosing your weather stripping. [5] X Research source V strip may also be labeled as “tension seal.” You can find adhesive weather stripping at a hardware store or online retailer. Weather stripping comes in different thicknesses, so it's a good idea to buy a few different sizes, then try them out with your door. If the weather stripping you use is too thick, your door might not close properly. [6] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. Buy as much weather stripping as you need based on your measurements, plus 10% extra as a precaution. For example, if you need 96 inches (240 cm) for your window, buy 106 inches (270 cm) of stripping."

      "title": "Cut your pieces of weather stripping to the correct length.",
      "content": "Cut your pieces of weather stripping to the correct length. Mark the length that you measured on the weather stripping using a pencil. Then trim the piece at the marked spot with a utility knife or pair of sturdy scissors. [7] X Research source If you’re weather stripping a window, you’ll need 4 pieces, 1 for the top, 1 for the bottom, and 1 for each side. To weather strip a door, you need 1 piece for the top and 1 piece for each side, for a total of 3 strips. The bottom of the door will require a door sweep."

      "title": "Line 1 piece of stripping along the side of the door or window frame.",
      "content": "Line 1 piece of stripping along the side of the door or window frame. Start by placing the end of the weather stripping in the top corner of the jamb. Then, arrange the rest of the piece so it lies flush against the door frame. [8] X Research source Install the weather stripping when the outside temperature is at least 50 °F (10 °C) to help the adhesive hold better. If you’re using V strip, place the stripping against the frame so that the opening of the V faces towards the exterior of the door or window. Do not put the weather stripping on the door itself."

      "content": "Peel off the backing and press the stripping firmly into place. Once you have the stripping aligned where you want it to go, remove the paper backing from the piece. Run your hands along the piece and apply pressure to secure the sticky side of the stripping to the door or window jamb. [9] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. To prevent the stripping from sticking to things it shouldn’t, peel a little bit of backing off at a time as you go, instead of removing it all at once. For extra protection, you can secure the stripping into place by hammering nails through it into the frame, or use a staple gun to insert heavy-duty staples into it."

      "content": "Place the sweep at the bottom of the inside of the door. Position it so that the flexible bottom piece of the sweep just grazes the floor. This will seal the gap underneath the door while also preventing the sweep from dragging against the floor when you open and close the door. [14] X Research source You can check that your door sweep is aligned properly by looking underneath the door. If you can see light coming through, move the sweep down a little until all of the light is blocked."

      "content": "Mark spots for the screws on the sweep and pre-drill pilot holes. Use a pencil to make a mark where each of the provided screws will go along the door sweep, spacing out the pilot holes evenly in a straight line. For example, if you have 3 screws, make 1 hole on each side of the sweep and then 1 in the center. Line up the drill bit with the marks and pull the trigger to drill through both the sweep and the door itself. [15] X Research source Your door sweep should come with 3 to 4 screws. If it doesn’t, you can use any #6 screws. For #6 screws, use a drill bit that’s at least 3 ⁄ 32 inch (0.24 cm) in diameter."
