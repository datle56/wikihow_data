      "content": "Turn an over-sized T-shirt inside out and spread it out flat. Choose a shirt that’s long enough to provide some upper leg coverage. Smooth any wrinkles so the shirt is resting flat against the floor or table in front of you. [1] X Research source The mini dress can be as short as you'd like, of course! Just make sure the shirt is long enough to cover your upper thighs so you can wear the dress in public. Don’t worry if the shirt is baggy on you—you'll be adjusting the fit to your liking."

Spread the tank top flat on top of the T-shirt and center it so the straps and neckline are in the correct positions. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut along the sides of the tank top to create the dress shape. Use sharp fabric scissors and cut about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) away from the tank top to account for the dress seams. https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-No-Sew-Dress Cut off the sleeves but leave the shirt collar for now—you can adjust the neckline later if you want. [3] X Research source The end result will be a sleeveless mini dress. If you want your dress to have sleeves, leave the T-shirt sleeves instead of cutting them off."

      "title": "Use hot glue to seal the side seams of the dress.",
      "content": "Use hot glue to seal the side seams of the dress. Peel back the top layer of the T-shirt and place a 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) line of hot glue along second layer's side seam, starting at the bottom hem. Put the top layer of the shirt back in place and press the material together along the seam to bond the fabric. [4] X Research source Continue working in 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) sections until you reach the armpit hole. Repeat the process for the other side seam until both seams are glued."

      "content": "Cut strips along the sides and tie them together for a racier look. Try this simple trick if you want intricate peek-a-boo side seams. Starting 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) below the armpit, cut 2 in (5.1 cm) horizontal lines all the way down to the bottom of the seam. Space the lines 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) apart. Do the same down the other side seam. Then, flip both layers of the shirt over to be right side out, line them up, and tie the strips together using double knots. [5] X Research source Be sure to cut through both shirt layers as you're making horizontal cuts. https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-No-Sew-Dress To create an hourglass or body-con dress shape, start with 3 in (7.6 cm) horizontal cuts under the armpit and move to 2 in (5.1 cm) cuts as you get closer to the bottom hem."

      "content": "Turn the sleeve edges back 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) and glue them down. You don’t have to do this, but it creates a cleaner edge for the sleeves once you turn the dress right side out. Just fold the sleeve material back about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) and hot glue the material down. Do the same for the other sleeve. [6] X Research source If you kept the shirt sleeves instead of cutting them off, skip this step. Give the hot glue about 5 minutes to dry and fully set."

If you like the way the neckline looks as is, you’re all set. If not, take of the dress off and cut a slit down the center of the collar for a V-neck. Or, cut a U-shape around the shirt collar if you'd prefer a scoop neckline. [7] X Research source Leave the neckline edges raw, or glue them back 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) like you did with the sleeves for a cleaner edge. Cinch the dress around your waist with a cute belt for a more fitted look. To style your T-shirt dress, add a few eye-catching accessories. Then, pair the dress with simple shoes like ballet flats, sandals, or flip-flops."

If you have a maxi skirt that you love, you can elevate it to a full-length dress without sewing a stitch! Put the maxi skirt on like normal and pull the waistband all the way up so it’s sitting right beneath your armpits. Wear a matching belt around your waist to create more structure.

If you have a gorgeous piece of fabric that you’d love to turn into a dress, coverup, or skirt, try this simple trick. Shake out the material and wrap it around your waist or under your armpits for the coverage you want. Then, tie the ends of the material together to hold it in place. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about the fabric coming untied, safety pin the material together on the underside of the dress (so the pin doesn’t show). Use a length of cloth or fabric that’s about 6.5 feet (2.0 m) long. A tablecloth, bed sheet, or even a curtain could work for this!"
