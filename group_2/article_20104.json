      "content": "Use the same word to call your dog each time. Your dog will learn to come when you call it if you always use the same word, such as \"Come\" or your dog's name. When your dog is learning to come, give it a treat and lavish it with praise and pets when it responds to your call. You can start out by calling the dog while it is close to you. For example, sit or stand a few feet away from your dog. Say, \"Come\" and hold out a treat. Praise and pet the dog when it comes. Once your dog associates treats with the call word, you can move out of sight. Overtime, it will learn to come inside when you call it."
