      "content": "Combine 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of coconut oil and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil in a small bowl. Coconut and olive oil are light, natural products that help moisturize dry hair and make it look shinier. Mix both in a bowl to get the most out of these hydrating ingredients. For longer hair, add more of each ingredient, keeping them in a 2:1 proportion. Coconut oil is a perfect hair mask ingredient for dry hair because it softens and conditions your hair."

      "content": "Add 1 ⁄ 2 c (120 mL) of honey to moisturize your hair. Honey is another natural product that adds hydration. Pour the honey into your mixture and stir well until everything’s combined. Keep in mind that honey can subtly lighten your hair color if you leave it on for an extended period of time or mix it with other lighteners like peroxide. [1] X Research source If you want to avoid this, leave out the honey or choose a different mask."

      "content": "Cover your hair with a shower cap and let it sit for 15 minutes. Pin your hair up or twist it into a loose bun, then slip a shower cap on top to lock in the moisture. Wait 15 to 30 minutes to let the mask fully soak in. If you plan on rinsing the mask out in the shower, start the water and wash your face and body while you wait."

      "title": "Apply heat to help the mask penetrate your hair.",
      "content": "Apply heat to help the mask penetrate your hair. If desired, use a hair dryer to heat your hair. This doesn’t speed up the drying time, but it can help activate the mask’s ingredients. Aim the dryer at your hair for a few minutes to open the hair cuticles so the moisturizing ingredients soak into your hair more easily."

      "content": "Rinse the mask out in the shower and condition it as normal. Wash out the mask in the shower with shampoo, then condition your hair to help lock in that moisture. Use this mask once a week to ensure your hair stays healthy and smooth. Skip the shampoo if your hair is really dry, as shampooing could draw out the moisture you just added in. Instead, wait another day or two before giving your scalp a good scrub."

      "content": "Mix ½ of an avocado and an egg yolk together. Slice a ripe avocado in half and scoop out the flesh. Mash it with a spoon or fork, then combine it in a small bowl with an egg yolk. Avocados and egg yolks both have moisturizing properties that can help tame curls and frizz while protecting hair follicles. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have longer hair, opt for 2 egg yolks rather than 1. For a smoother texture, mix your ingredients with a blender or food processor."

      "content": "Add 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of honey and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of coconut oil for shine. Adding a spoonful of honey and coconut oil can make your hair shinier and add more moisture. Stir them into your avocado and egg mixture, making sure to loosen up the honey and incorporate it fully. Honey may subtly lighten your hair, so avoid using it if you don’t want to alter your hair color. If you don’t have coconut oil, no worries! Substitute it with extra virgin olive oil.

      "content": "Smooth the mixture over damp hair. Brush out your hair to remove any tangles. Then, spritz your hair with water until it’s damp, or wet your hair in the shower. Use your hands to spoon the mixture onto your head. Comb the mask through your hair, making sure to coat everything from the roots to the scalp. [8] X Research source Pile your covered hair onto your scalp, secure it with a claw clip, or drape a towel over your shoulders to keep long hair from touching your clothing later. Stay out of the sun when wearing this hair mask, as the lemon juice could be activated by the sun’s UV rays and lighten your hair color."

Step in the shower and rinse the mask out with cold water, as warm or hot water could cook the egg whites. [9] X Research source Wash your hair with shampoo after removing the mask to ensure all the egg whites and lemon juice are gone. Consider conditioning your hair as usual to help lock in moisture so your oil-free hair looks shiny and healthy."
