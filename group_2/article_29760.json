      "title": "Use pliers to cut 3 inches (7.6 cm) of wire from the spool.",
      "content": "Use pliers to cut 3 inches (7.6 cm) of wire from the spool. This can be gold, copper, or silver wire. Measure the wire using a ruler, or do a rough estimate and cut roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) without measuring. If in doubt, make the piece of wire longer as opposed to shorter—you can always trim off the ends if necessary. [1] X Research source The thickness and exact color of the wire is entirely up to you, but thinner wire is best as it allows you to easily manipulate it. Look for artistic wire at a craft or hardware store that comes in a small spool, as these are most often used for making jewelry. Flatten out the wire after it’s cut. Straightening it out will make the wire easier to work with."

      "title": "Use pliers to create indentations in the wire if you want a textured ring.",
      "content": "Use pliers to create indentations in the wire if you want a textured ring. How many dents you create is up to you—space them out evenly or make the dents super close together so the ring appears to have stripes, if desired. Hold the wire steady in one hand and use your dominant hand to create small dents with round nose pliers. [2] X Research source This is a great way to add style and a unique quality to your ring."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the wire to create a wavy pattern for an artsy ring.",
      "content": "Bend the wire to create a wavy pattern for an artsy ring. Instead of using the pliers to make indentations in the wire, use them to bend the wire in different directions. As you hold the wire firmly in one hand, use the pliers to bend down on the wire. Continue by then bending the next section of wire upwards, switching back and forth between downwards and upwards motions to create a wave along the wire. [3] X Research source If desired, you can make small indentations along the wire before creating a ripple effect as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add beads to the ring to add color or sparkle.",
      "content": "Add beads to the ring to add color or sparkle. Pick out a few beads that you’d like to use on your ring, making sure they have a hole in them so they can slide down the wire. Once you’ve added the beads to the wire, create bends in the wire on both sides of the beads so that the beads stay in place. [4] X Research source For example, you might pick out one larger bead to be set in the middle of two smaller, identical beads. Pick out super tiny beads that can be strung along the entire wire if you want your ring to be completely beaded."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the wire around the top of a nail polish bottle once the design is finished.",
      "content": "Wrap the wire around the top of a nail polish bottle once the design is finished. After you’ve made your dents or ripples and added any beads, position the wire around a nail polish bottle handle. This will resemble your finger, letting you bend the ring into shape. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a nail polish bottle to use, look for a different perfectly round, ring-sized object to wrap the wire around. Using hard objects, as opposed to just your finger, is better for creating the ring shape as it ensures your ring is perfectly round."

    {
      "title": "Mark where you need to cut off the ends of the ring.",
      "content": "Mark where you need to cut off the ends of the ring. Place the wire around your finger once it’s rounded, checking to see where it needs to be cut so that it fits your finger perfectly. Mark where the wire ends should be cut using a marker. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use pliers to cut the ring so it's the right size.",
      "content": "Use pliers to cut the ring so it's the right size. Trim the wire right where you made your markings. If desired, wash the marker off of the wire using soap and water, or use acetone if you used a permanent marker."

    {
      "title": "Sand the edges of the wire so they're smooth.",
      "content": "Sand the edges of the wire so they're smooth. Use a nail file to sand the edges of the wire so that they aren’t sharp anymore, making your ring more comfortable and safe. Once the sharp edges of your ring have been filed down, the ring is ready to wear! [7] X Research source You can also bend the very tips of the wire backwards using pliers so that they’re not poking your finger, if desired."

      "title": "Find a coin you’re willing to make into a ring.",
      "content": "Find a coin you’re willing to make into a ring. While you can use any sort of coin, it’s best to start with larger ones, such as a quarter, unless you’re making a ring for smaller fingers. The coin doesn’t need to be new—it can be spare change you already have around the house. [8] X Research source Make sure the coin isn't valuable before deciding to turn it into a ring."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold your coin on a flat, hard surface.",
      "content": "Hold your coin on a flat, hard surface. Look for a flat piece of heavy metal, a concrete floor, or any other solid, hard surface. This will be your base for hammering, and you’ll hold the coin on top of the hard surface. [9] X Research source Choose a surface that won’t be damaged by a hammer. A bench vise is another option for a flat, hard surface."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hammer the edges of the coin while rotating it slowly.",
      "content": "Hammer the edges of the coin while rotating it slowly. Hold the coin using one hand so that it’s sitting up straight with a sliver of an edge touching the hard surface. Use a hammer to gently hit the edges of the coin, rotating the coin slowly as you hammer so that all of the sides are hit evenly. Continue hammering until the coin reaches the thickness of a ring. [10] X Research source Make sure your fingers aren’t in the way of the hammer as it’s hitting the top of the coin’s edges. How thick you want your ring to be is entirely up to you—roughly 0.5 cm (0.20 in) wide is good. Thicker rings will take longer to hammer, so be patient during this step. Avoid hitting the coin with a lot of force, as this could turn it into an oval or damage the overall form."

      "title": "Place the coin flat on a piece of wood.",
      "content": "Place the coin flat on a piece of wood. Make sure the piece of wood is thick enough that the drill can go down into the wood without messing up the surface underneath. Place the coin in the center of the piece of wood, and either hold the coin with your fingers or use an adjustable wrench to keep the coin steady. [11] X Research source If you’re holding the coin, hold the very edges so that your fingers won’t be in the way of the drill."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drill a large hole in the center of the coin.",
      "content": "Drill a large hole in the center of the coin. Hold the coin steady as you drill the hole. Start with a smaller gauge and drill all the way through the coin. Switch the drill bit to a larger size, then drill through the metal again. [12] X Research source Once you’ve drilled the hole, the coin should be left with roughly 0.5 cm (0.20 in) of coin thickness around the entire edge."

    {
      "title": "Grind out the middle of the coin using a sanding wheel.",
      "content": "Grind out the middle of the coin using a sanding wheel. If you have a sanding wheel that attaches to your drill, this is great for sanding out the rest of the coin to create a smooth ring. Hold the coin steady using your fingers or some other sort of clamp as you sand the inside of the ring until it thins out. [13] X Research source A dremel tool with an attachable sanding wheel is also a good option. Continue sanding until the coin is the thickness you want your ring to be."

      "title": "Polish the ring using a polishing wheel or cloth.",
      "content": "Polish the ring using a polishing wheel or cloth. Attach a polishing wheel to your drill or dremel, using a small amount of polishing compound to get the best shine. Run the polishing wheel along the inside and outside of the ring, smoothing out all of the edges so the ring is shiny and completed. [14] X Research source To use polishing compound, dip a rag or polishing wheel into the container of polish, using a small amount to rub over the ring's surface."

Make sure the proportions stay the same—the paper should be twice as long as it is wide. [15] X Research source Use a thick, colorful piece of paper for a sturdy, bright ring."

Unfold the vertical fold so that the piece of paper is long and skinny, and fold in both triangles that have creases in the middle of the paper so that they disappear.
