      "content": "Try deep breathing, sitting on an exercise ball, or supported squats. For exercises to encourage your water to break, your cervix needs to be soft and ready to be dilated on its own. In other words, your body has to already be preparing for labor for these methods to work. If your cervix and body are ready, low-impact exercises can encourage your water to break and start up contractions. [6] X Research source Try deep breathing exercises. Hold your breath and exhale slowly through your mouth, imagining the baby being pushed down into your pelvis. Repeat until you feel your pelvic floor muscles relax. Sit on an exercise ball and gently bounce. As you sit, keep your legs apart and move your body up and down on the ball. This can help your pelvic floor contract and relax. Supported squats stretch the pelvic floor, helping your baby move down towards your pelvis. Position your back against the wall and keep your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and lower your body as far as is comfortable. Exhale as you lower your body and inhale as you stand up again.
