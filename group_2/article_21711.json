      "title": "Measure the length of your bunting.",
      "content": "Measure the length of your bunting. Grab a tape measure and measure the length from end to end of your bunting to find out how large of a space you need. Keep a little bit of slack in the bunting if you want it to hang loosely instead of all the way stretched taut. [1] X Research source If you are using flag bunting, stretch it all the way taut unless you want it to sag in the middle. If your bunting is hanging on a length of twine or cord, it should probably sag in the middle slightly."

      "title": "Mark the area that you want to hang your bunting on.",
      "content": "Mark the area that you want to hang your bunting on. Use your tape measure to mark out the area that you want to hang your bunting. Make your mark on either side of the tape measure with a pencil. [2] X Research source You can hang your bunting on a wall, a railing, or a windowsill if you want to keep it outside. You can also put small bunting inside on your shelves, your table, or on a wall for a party decoration."

      "title": "Attach a push pin or nail to each end of your measured space.",
      "content": "Attach a push pin or nail to each end of your measured space. If your bunting is heavy, use a hammer to hammer in 1 nail on each mark that you made. If your bunting is lighter or you won’t be keeping it up for long, push in 1 large push pin to each mark that you made. [3] X Research source If you are putting your bunting up on a stone wall, carefully push the nails into the spaces between the stones."

      "title": "Tie the ends of your bunting cord to each push pin or nail.",
      "content": "Tie the ends of your bunting cord to each push pin or nail. Use the excess end of the bunting cord to attach it to the push pins or the nails. Tie each end in a secure knot so that your bunting doesn’t come loose. [4] X Research source If you are using bunting that has grommets in it, simply slide the grommets over the nails or push pins."

      "title": "Take out the nails with the back of a hammer to take down the bunting.",
      "content": "Take out the nails with the back of a hammer to take down the bunting. When it comes time to remove your bunting, simply pull out the push pins and untie your strings. Or, use the back of a hammer to gently pry the nails out of your wall, windowsill, or shelves. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Measure your bunting to see how long it is.",
      "content": "Measure your bunting to see how long it is. Make sure your bunting is stretched taut as you measure it, unless you’d like it to sag in the middle. You can write down the length of your bunting or just keep your tape measure in place to make a mark on your wall. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean off the area you want to hang your bunting with water and soap.",
      "content": "Clean off the area you want to hang your bunting with water and soap. Dip a rag into warm water and then apply 1 drop of dish soap to it and use it to clean off the entire area that you want to hang your bunting. Then, take a clean, damp cloth and wipe off the soapy water. Let the area air-dry for about 30 minutes until it isn’t damp anymore. [7] X Research source Adhesive hooks will stick much better to surfaces that are clean and free of dirt and debris. Adhesive hooks work the best on wood or drywall surfaces. If you are hanging bunting on a brick wall, use brick clips instead. You can hang your bunting on a railing, a windowsill, or even above your front door."

      "content": "Stick 2 to 3 hooks at each end and the middle of your bunting area. Take the back off of 2 or 3 adhesive hooks and attach the sticky sides about 1 in (2.5 cm) above each mark that you made. Space out each hook so there are 2 on each end of your bunting and 1 in the middle. [9] X Research source If you are putting bunting on a brick wall, attach brick clips to each brick by fitting 1 clip around the length of 1 brick. If your bunting is going on a windowsill, attach the hooks on the upper part of it. If you are hanging bunting that is on a length of string and you want it to hang loosely, you don’t need a hook in the middle."

      "title": "Tie your bunting to the hooks with metal wire.",
      "content": "Tie your bunting to the hooks with metal wire. Take 1 in (2.5 cm) lengths of metal wire and wrap the top parts around the adhesive hooks. Wrap the bottom part of the wire 2 to 3 times around the cord of your bunting. If your bunting has grommets, you can wrap the wire around those instead. [10] X Research source You can find metal wire at most hardware stores. If you can’t find metal wire, you can also use twine."
