Here are some ideas to get you started: Glue two to three leaves onto the clip with the points facing outward, like rays on a sun.

You can arrange them in any pattern your want, but here are some ideas to get you started: Work in odd numbers. This will make your piece look more natural and organic. Work from large to small. Place the largest flower at one end of the clip, and work your way towards the other side, using smaller flowers as you go. Use all the same size flowers on a barrette clip. If you have small flowers, such as chamomile or mini roses, you can glue them down the center of the clip. Use the largest flower in the center of the clip, and place the smaller flowers to the left and right of it. Place a large flower in the center and use filler, such as baby's breath or leaves, around it. If you are using a real flower, consider using a safety pin to attach the fresh flower to the clip. Slide the needle through both of the felt parts. [4] X Research source"
