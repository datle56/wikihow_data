      "content": "Cut your hemp into 2 lengths and tie them together. Cut 2 long pieces of hemp about 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Match the ends up and fold both pieces in half. Tie a knot at the fold. The type of knot you’ll be making to start the bracelet is called an overhand knot. It’s the same kind of basic knot you make when you start tying your shoe. Grab the folded end of the lengths of twine and cross it over the loose strands to make a loop, then cross it under again and pull it tight. The length of hemp you'll need will depend on the size of your wrist and how many knots you want in the bracelet. If you want a solidly-knotted bracelet for an average adult-sized wrist, your strings need to be about 2 yd (1.8 m) long. If you only want to make a few knots, you can get away with a lot less string. [1] X Expert Source Lois Wade wikiHow Crafts Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020."

      "content": "Attach one end to an anchor with tape or a pin. It helps to tape the loop left from the knot onto a table or safety pin to a chair or the knee of your jeans. This will give you some leverage as you create the pattern of knots in the bracelet. Try fastening the piece to a board or a foam sheet to hold it firmly. That way, you'll be able to pull the knots firmly and evenly, which will help them hold for a long time. [2] X Expert Source Lois Wade wikiHow Crafts Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020."
