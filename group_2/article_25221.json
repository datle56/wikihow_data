      "content": "Use knit front and back when you don’t mind leaving a bump. Knitting front and back is an easy way to increase. However, increasing this way leaves a visible bump in your knitting, so it is not ideal for all projects. [1] X Research source For example, you might use this method of increasing when you are using a textured stitch, such as the garter stitch. It is also fine to use when the area with the increases will be hidden, such as on the underside of a sleeve."

Push the right-hand needle into the front of the stitch on the left-hand needle and loop the yarn over the end of the needle.

[3] X Research source If you are purling this row, then purl this first stitch without letting the old stitch slip off."
