      "content": "Go to StubHub.com or Ticketmaster's Ticket Exchange. StubHub is an affiliate of eBay and a partner of Major League Baseball and most of the American and National league teams. The following are good tips for buying baseball tickets on this secondary market: [3] X Research source StubHub has the advantage of guaranteeing your tickets, unlike some other websites. They have agreed to a process of reselling series tickets for the MLB. Once you buy a seat from an existing ticket, they deactivate the old ticket bar code and they create a new bar code for them. They will send you the tickets by email in Portable Document Format (PDF). Go to the \"World Series\" section on StubHub.com site. It will tell you how many tickets are available and the lowest price you can find. Click on \"See Tickets.\" You can choose based on price, number of tickets, seating and more. Buy a ticket with a credit card as soon as you find the tickets. They are not likely to be available at the same price for long. Search for tickets during the playoff games. Buying tickets before the teams are set allows you the option of a refund. StubHub knows that even if you ask for a refund, they can always resell it to an eager fan. As soon as the game is decided, ticket prices will go up by $100 to $1,000. Set a \"Price Alert.\" You can name a price that you are willing to pay and you will receive word if there is a ticket available. This is a good way to stay within a budget. Tickets are sold up to 2 hours before the game. Prices may go down as the game nears, because the seller will not benefit from having an empty seat. [4] X Research source"

This is rare, but others may assume that there are no tickets. Buy tickets at the bigger stadium, if you have an option between the 2. Because there are more seats available, they are also likely to be less expensive."
