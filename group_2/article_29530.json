      "content": "Fold a square piece of paper in half to make triangles. Grab one corner and pull it diagonally across the square to the other corner, lining them up on top of each other. Line up the edges, too. Make a crease across the paper, creating one triangle folded on top of another. [1] X Research source Run your fingernail across the crease to make it sharper."

      "title": "Crease the triangle by folding it in half again and unfold it.",
      "content": "Crease the triangle by folding it in half again and unfold it. With the original fold at the top, bring the top right corner over to meet the top left corner, lining them up. Make sure the edges are aligned, and then crease it down the middle. You should now have a smaller triangle with a fold on the right. [2] X Research source Once you've run your fingernail along this crease, open it up again to the original triangle you folded."

    {
      "title": "Fold the 2 corners of the triangle down.",
      "content": "Fold the 2 corners of the triangle down. Lift up the right corner of the triangle. Bring it over toward the middle. When you make this fold, the edge of the triangle will start at the middle point of the larger triangle on the long top side and run outward to one side of the bottom point. The point will hang over the edge of the larger triangle. Make a crease along the top. Do the same on the other side. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bring the bottom point up about halfway.",
      "content": "Bring the bottom point up about halfway. Grab the point at the bottom and make a fold about 1/4 of the way up the triangle. That will leave the point about halfway up. Use your finger to make a crease across this fold. [4] X Research source At this point, you should have a triangle on each side with the points hanging over the edge. In the middle, you'll have a large triangle with a smaller triangle inside it."

      "content": "Flip the paper over to see your cat and draw a face. When you flip it over, turn the paper so the pointed parts you folded over the edge are at the top, making the ears. Draw on eyes, a nose, mouth, and whiskers, and your paper kitty is done. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Flatten out and paint the plate. Use your fingers to stretch out the edge of the paper plate as much as possible. Paint the back side of the plate the color you want your cat to be. Black works well for a scary Halloween cat! [6] X Research source You can use acrylic paint, tempura paint, or even finger paint. Apply it with a sponge brush, sponge, or large paintbrush."

      "title": "Trace and cut out a large circle on one edge of the plate.",
      "content": "Trace and cut out a large circle on one edge of the plate. Use a food container top or another large circle you have. The circle should take up about 50% of the larger circle. Trace it close to one edge on the non-painted side, then cut out the circle and that edge together. [7] X Research source You can also use a compass to trace the circle. You want the larger circle to end up looking like a crescent moon with pointed ends."

Using a container lid, trace a smaller circle onto the back of this piece in the smooth part of the plate and snip around it. Leave the wrinkled edge for the tail. From the strip you have left, cut out 2 small triangles for ears and a curved piece for the tail. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Tape the head and tail on the crescent. Flip the crescent shape so the points are downward, forming the legs. Turn it to the non-painted side. Tape or glue the smaller circle on one side of the arch near the top. Place it slightly behind the big circle. Arrange the tail arching away from the crescent on the other end and tape or glue it into place. [9] X Research source The painted sides should all be facing front."

Cut out small strips for the whiskers and glue them into place. For the eyes and nose, you can cut out pieces of paper in other colors or use googly eyes and a pompom for the nose. [10] X Research source For a cat nose, cut a little triangle out of pink paper. For eyes, cut eye shapes then draw in slits in the middle."

Fold it over to make this long edge half the size; make sure the edges meet. [12] X Research source For another type of body, cut out a wide triangle with a curved edge. Pull the sides of the triangle together to overlap, making a cone. Glue the edges together. You can cut out small strips of paper for feet at the bottom. [13] X Research source"

Come in about 1 inch (2.5 cm) on this edge and cut a half circle that reaches to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the other side. [14] X Research source This makes the body and the legs; the top of the half circle is the body and the parts that come down are the legs. Unfold the rectangle slightly to make an \"A\" shape. On the bottom of each leg, bend out a small square that's about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) long; fold it at a 90-degree angle to make feet."

As you glue the body, make an \"A\" shape with it using the feet as the bottom of the \"A.\" Hold the feet in place for a few seconds until the glue starts to set. [15] X Research source If you used the cone-shaped body, you don't need to glue it to anything, as it is sturdy enough as it is."

Cut off the corners of the strip so that the tail is pointed at both of the short ends. [16] X Research source You could cut out a curvy tail instead if you prefer! [17] X Research source"

Fold the rectangle back, and the cuts you just made will pop up for the ears. [18] X Research source Run your fingernail along the crease at the top to make sure the cat's face stays folded."
