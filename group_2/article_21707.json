      "content": "Use D-ring hangers to wire and hang your artwork; these hangers are specifically constructed to hang small, medium, and large wooden frames. Then, select a metal wire with a break weight that's greater than the weight of your artwork. D-rings that have more than 1 screw hole typically hold up heavier frames. Use braided wire to hold up to 36 pounds (16 kg). Choose stainless steel wire to hold up to 100 pounds (45 kg). Select vinyl-coated wire to hold up to 60 pounds (27 kg)."

Then, use your answer to measure down from the top of the frame and make a mark on the right and left sides of the frame. [1] X Research source For example, if your frame is 21 inches (53.3 cm) long, make a mark for your D-rings 7 inches (17.8 cm) down from the top of the frame. Protect your artwork while you’re working by laying it face down on a sheet, towel, or other soft material."

Then, align the rings so they’re straight across from each other and ½ inch (1.3 cm) from the frame’s edges. Angle each ring upwards at a 45° angle and screw each piece into the frame with a screwdriver or drill.

Loop the wire up through the left ring and cross it under itself. Push about 3 to 4 inches (7.6-10 cm) of the wire up through the left D-ring. Then, wrap it over the ring and cross it under the wire.

Just adjust the wire’s tautness until the wire rests 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) below the top of the frame. [5] X Research source Adding slack to the wire eases the tension on the wire and rings. It also helps your artwork hang more level."
