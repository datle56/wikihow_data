      "content": "He always treats you with respect . When your boyfriend really loves you, he'll be interested in you. He will respect your ideas and opinions, even when he doesn't agree with them. He'll pay attention to details about your likes and dislikes, and he'll accommodate your needs to the best of his ability. [1] X Research source If you answer yes to the following questions, that's a strong indicator that he loves you: Does he ask you about your life? Does he appear to genuinely care about your feelings and opinions? Does he respect your point of view when you disagree with him? Does he speak to you in a kind and considerate way? Does he accept and adhere to any boundaries you set?"

      "content": "He initiates lots of casual touches. When someone is in love, they want to be close to you. Maybe he places his hand on your leg when you’re sitting next to each other, or puts his hand on your lower back when you’re walking. Or, maybe he reaches out and tucks your hair behind your ear when you're talking. These types of touches demonstrate to the world that the person cares for you deeply. [2] X Research source If your boyfriend doesn’t do these things, it isn’t necessarily a red flag— if he's shy or grew up in a culture where public touching isn't acceptable, he may not feel comfortable showing this type of affection, even if he does really love you.

      "title": "He cares deeply about your well-being.",
      "content": "He cares deeply about your well-being. If your boyfriend is in love with you, your happiness will be his happiness. [4] X Research source When you’re sad, anxious, or frustrated, he’ll make an effort to comfort you. If your boyfriend pays attention to your emotions and goes out of his way to make sure you feel content and safe, this is a big sign of his love. For example, if he’s bad at responding to messages but he knows you get anxious if you haven’t heard from him all day, he’ll work on being a better texter. He may also learn your love language and make an effort to adjust his actions based on that. If you’re a big fan of words of affirmation, for instance, he’ll do his best to show his love and support through his words."

      "title": "He does nice things for you to let you know he’s thinking of you.",
      "content": "He does nice things for you to let you know he’s thinking of you. When someone is crazy about you, they’re always thinking of little ways to brighten your day. For example, maybe he knows that you have a favorite meal from a certain restaurant, so he picks it up for you when you’ve had a tough day, explains Gopman. If he goes out of his way to show you that you’re on his mind, this is definitely a sign that he cares!"

      "title": "He makes you a priority.",
      "content": "He makes you a priority. If your boyfriend is in love, you’ll be one of the most important things in his life. This doesn’t mean that you’re the only thing he cares about, but nurturing your relationship will definitely be one of his top priorities. [5] X Research source He’ll make time for you in his schedule, check in with you throughout the day, and tell you how important you are to him on a regular basis. On the flip side, if it seems like he’s consistently putting other things above you, this would be a bit more concerning, explains Keegan. For example, if you try to set up dates with him but he’d rather be with his friends most of the time, this may be a sign that he’s not all-in, Keegan says."

      "content": "He trusts you completely. A partner who truly loves you will give you the benefit of the doubt. [6] X Research source This means he won’t get jealous and accuse you of being unfaithful for no reason, or demand all the passwords to your accounts so he can snoop. He'll believe the things you say to him, and he’ll respect your boundaries."

      "content": "He makes an effort to compromise with you. There are bound to be a few disagreements in any relationship, but if your boyfriend genuinely cares for you, he'll make an effort to meet you in the middle. Whether he compromises on little things (like going to see a movie he isn’t interested in because he knows you'll like it) or bigger issues (like accepting that you’re not ready to move in together yet) compromise is an important sign that your boyfriend really loves you. [7] X Research source True compromise doesn't mean \"I'll do this for you if you do this for me.\" It's not a negotiation—it’s about working together to find common ground. Does he insist on being right when you have a disagreement or argument? Or is he okay with letting you have the last word?

We all have our little quirks and habits we’d like to work on, but if your boyfriend is deeply in love with you, he’ll love the full picture of who you are and make you feel good about yourself. [8] X Research source This means he won’t be nitpicky, critical, or judgmental, and he won’t try to change you. He’ll celebrate all the amazing things about you, and he’ll be understanding of your little flaws—just like you’ll be of his."

He won’t have any problems telling people that you’re together—in fact, he’ll probably want to brag about you all the time, and he’ll be glad to walk into events and social gatherings with you on his arm. [9] X Research source If your boyfriend has this type of energy about your relationship, this is a pretty clear sign that he’s crazy about you!"

      "content": "He wants you to spend time with his friends and family. “Make sure he brings you into his life, that you’re meeting his friends and family,” says Keegan. When a guy truly sees a future with you, he’ll want to bring you into his social circle and include you in all areas of his life. So, if he invites you to events like birthday parties, family dinners, or holiday gatherings, this is a huge sign that his feelings run deep! [10] X Research source On the other hand, if he doesn’t want to introduce you to family or friends and prefers to hang out with you alone, this could be a sign that his feelings are less serious. Keep in mind, however, that including you in his family life may be difficult if his relationship with his family is rocky. In this case, it wouldn’t be a bad sign if he hadn’t introduced you to them."

Someone who loves you will be interested in getting closer to the people in your life. Even if he doesn't like them, he'll be willing to spend time with them if you want him to. If your boyfriend avoids your family and friends, he might be shy or worried about making a good impression, but this is something you should be able to work through. If he’s still unwilling to meet them after you’ve explained how important it is to you, it may be more of an issue. If he tries to get you to avoid them too, this is another problematic sign. It may indicate that he has a tendency to be overly controlling. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "He participates in your hobbies and interests. Someone who loves you will try to show interest in the hobbies and activities you enjoy, even if he doesn't care for them that much. [12] X Research source For example, he'll try to play video games with you every once in a while, even if he isn’t much of a gamer himself. Or, he’ll ask you about the novel you’re reading, even if he isn’t a bookworm. These things are all signs that he feels deeply for you! A man who really loves you will pay attention to what you like and dislike. He'll try to make sure you're happy, because your happiness matters to him. [13] X Research source On the other hand, if you’re always doing activities that he enjoys, and he never makes an effort to do the same for you, this could be a bit of a problem. His wants and needs shouldn't take priority over yours 100% of the time."

Is he listening to you when you tell him you have an important day or a big meeting coming up, and then is he calling to see how that meeting went?

      "content": "He supports your goals and cheers you on. Keegan explains that a healthy relationship isn’t just about doing things together—it’s also about being respectful of your partner’s independence and their life outside the relationship. If your boyfriend supports you in your personal goals at work, school, and beyond, this is another big sign that he truly loves you. For example, if you’re going after a promotion at work, challenging yourself to get a certain grade in a class, or learning a new creative skill, he’ll check in with you about how things are going and offer encouragement as often as he can. And, when you achieve your goals, he’ll be super proud of you and brag about your successes to anyone who’ll listen. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "He uses the word \"we\" rather than \"I\".",
      "content": "He uses the word \"we\" rather than \"I\". When someone loves you, he considers you when he's thinking about his daily life or the future. This means that he’ll refer to the two of you as a unit when making plans, rather than only answering for himself. For example, if a friend asks him to come to a dinner party, he may say something like, “I’ll have to see if we’re free that night,” instead of “I’ll have to see if I’m free that night.” Keegan also recommends listening to how he responds when you try to plan something with him in the slightly distant future. For example, “If you want to plan a trip six months from now or three months from now and he’s like, ‘I’m not sure about that,’ that’s a sign that he’s not all the way in, that he's not there yet,” Keegan explains."

If he truly does love you he should be able to take responsibility for his actions, own up to a mistake, and apologize in a heartfelt way. [15] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source A boyfriend who is stubborn may have a hard time apologizing for when he's wrong, but if he loves you he'll be uncomfortable until things are right between you again.

      "content": "He backs up his affectionate words with his actions. Just saying \"I love you\" isn't enough—it’s important to consider whether his actions match his words. Does he do kind things for you, make an effort to spend quality time with you, and share his life with you? If he does, this a good sign that his affection for you is true and sincere. [17] X Research source On the other hand, if he says he loves you but disrespects you, belittles you, or doesn’t make an effort to connect with you, this could be more of a red flag. The mismatch between his words and actions indicates that he might be untrustworthy or insincere. If you aren't sure whether you should trust someone's words, ask a trusted person for help figuring it out. Maybe they've noticed something that you haven't."

      "content": "Give him a little more time to figure out his feelings. If he hasn’t said “I love you” and you aren’t able to figure this out based on his actions, he may just be taking his time to get to know you and build your connection. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing! Romances that burn bright right away are liable to fizzle out quickly, but connections that are built slowly and steadily often have the ability to stand the test of time. [18] X Research source Try to be patient and trust that when he realizes he loves you, he’ll tell you. There’s no absolute rule about how long it takes a man to tell someone he is in love, but a 2022 study did indicate that men take an average of about 108 days (4 months) to verbally confess their feelings.

      "title": "Ask him how he feels about you directly.",
      "content": "Ask him how he feels about you directly. If you’re not sure how he feels and you’re uncomfortable sitting in that uncertainty, Keegan recommends bringing up the topic with him and gauging his reaction. “You can just directly ask him, ‘how much do you love me’ in a fun, playful way. If he looks to the right or left, instead of looking at you and saying ‘I love you, let me count the ways,’ you may have a problem,” he explains. Bringing up the topic may seem a little daunting, but Gopman encourages this vulnerability. “We’re always scared to tell people how we’re feeling because we’re scared to get hurt, but the way to truly fall in love is to be vulnerable. Relationships should be built on honesty and trust and being able to tell a person how you feel,” Gopman says."

      "title": "Consider ending things if you don’t think there’s a future.",
      "content": "Consider ending things if you don’t think there’s a future. If you’ve assessed his words and behavior and it seems like his feelings aren’t serious, think about whether or not you want to continue the relationship. “Our time is so valuable, and if you don’t necessarily see a future with that person, it might be worth considering breaking up,” says Gopman. “Because by being in a relationship with someone who’s not the right one, you’re taking the chance of missing out on the person that is right for you.” This can be a tough decision, so take your time and really think things over . Ultimately, it’s about making sure you’re with someone who feels as deeply for you as you do for them. “Do they make you happy? Do they make you better and stronger? Do they bring something amazing to the table for you? If the answer is no, that might be a sign that it's time to break up,\" says Gopman. \"Breakups are never easy, but the longer you're in a relationship that isn't right for you, the more time you're missing out on the person that could be your perfect person,” Gopman explains."
