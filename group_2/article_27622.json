      "content": "Wash out a jar with a tight-fitting lid. You will need a clean jar with a tight-fitting lid that can hold 12 ounces (355 milliliters). The jar can be made out of glass or plastic. If you plan on making glossy or glittery Mod Podge, you will need a slightly-larger jar."

      "content": "Find some craft glue. You will need about 8 ounces (225 milliliters) of white, liquid glue—the sort kids use in school. If your bottle already contains 8 ounces/225 milliliters (or close to it) then you will not need to measure it out. If your bottle contains more glue, however, then you will need to pour the glue into a measuring cup to make sure that you have the right amount.

      "title": "Open the bottle of glue, and pour it into the container.",
      "content": "Open the bottle of glue, and pour it into the container. You can simply rest the glue bottle over the rim of the jar and let the glue drain on its own, or you can squeeze it out. If the glue is thick and will not come out easily, you can pour a little bit of hot, boiling water into the glue bottle, close the cap tightly, and shake. The hot water will help loosen the glue. Open the glue bottle again and pour it into the jar—it should come out easier now. Consider warming the glue in a microwave for about 30 seconds (or fewer, depending on the strength of your microwave). This will help the glue bottle empty easier and faster."

If any of the Mod Podge seeps out from under the lid, simply clean it off with a damp cloth. Mod Podge won't yellow over time whereas Elmer's Glue will, so be aware of that.

If the mixture starts to become too thick, then add more water and keep stirring. Consider adding vinegar. Adding ¼ teaspoon of vinegar can help control fungus and mold from developing in your Mod Podge. If you choose to add vinegar, do so after you have removed the pot from the stove, and give the Mod Podge one, final stir."

Make the label after you have poured the Mod Podge into the container and shaken it up. Here is how you can make a label from scratch, without a computer or printer: Write \"Mod Podge\" or \"Decoupage\" on a small piece of paper. Cut a piece of clear, packaging tape that is bigger than your label. Place the label face down onto the middle of the piece of tape. Wrap the packing tape around the glass container. Smooth the tape down to rid the label of any air bubbles."

You can make it more durable by wait until it has dried completely (several hours) and then applying spray-on acrylic sealer. Simply hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface and spray the paint on using light, even strokes. Once the sealer has dried, you may add a second coat, if necessary. If you added varnish or glitter to your Mod Podge to make it glossy, be sure that you use an acrylic sealer with a gloss finish."

      "content": "Understand that the quality between the two is different. Homemade Mod Podge is usually made using watered-down glue, so it lacks some of the properties that store-bought Mod Podge has. Store-bought Mod Podge can be used as both an adhesive and sealant, making it durable. The homemade version is less-adhesive, and lacks varnish or sealer.= To make your homemade Mod Podge more durable, consider spraying your project with an acrylic sealant after the Mod Podge has dried.#Know that the finish differs between the two. Store-bought Mod Podge comes in all sorts of finishes from glossy, to satin, to matte. It even comes in glow-in-the-dark and sparkling varieties. Unless you add varnish or glitter, your homemade Mod Podge will be matte. Flour-based Mod Podge will may leave behind some residue or a grainy texture."

Unfortunately, this also makes the final product perishable. You must store it in a cool place and use it within a week or two, or else it will expire and begin to rot."
