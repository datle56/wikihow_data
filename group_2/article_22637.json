      "content": "The easiest way to hide a tattoo is to change your outfit up a little bit. Sleeves and pant legs can easily cover up visible tattoos on your arms and legs. A scarf can cover up a tattoo on your neck or upper chest. If you have ankle or lower-leg tattoos, longer socks or boots can cover them up. Throw your outfit together and check a mirror before you go out to make sure your tattoos aren’t visible at all. [1] X Research source Hats will cover head tattoos. They can also hide artwork behind your ears or along your hairline. Gloves are an easy way to cover up hand or wrist tattoos. There are tattoo cover-up compression sleeves you can find in a variety of skin tones. If it’s too hot for a long-sleeved shirt, you can always slide one of these over your arm or leg to cover tattoos up."

      "content": "Camouflaging your tattoo with makeup is a great solution, but it can take practice. First, clean your skin with rubbing alcohol. Then, squirt a dollop of makeup primer into your hand and massage it into your skin. [2] X Research source Grab a foundation with that’s a little brighter than your skin to counteract the dark ink. Use a wedge sponge or makeup brush to work the foundation into your skin by blotting it repeatedly over the tattoo and blend the edges into your surrounding skin. Spread a translucent setting powder over the foundation to help it set. Add additional layers of foundation as needed until you’ve matched the color of your surrounding skin. [3] X Research source There is makeup out there designed specifically for covering tattoos if you plan on doing this regularly. [4] X Research source This can take a little bit of trial and error, so don’t worry if it takes a few attempts before you fully blend the tattoo into your skin. If you’re having trouble, try using a brighter foundation to counteract the dark lines. Then, put a more natural foundation on top of that. It may take multiple layers of foundation to cover it up all the way. You can also dab on a reddish eye shadow or lipstick and then cover the area with a concealer that matches your skin tone.

      "content": "Small adhesive bandages are a great way to hide tiny tattoos. If you have any larger work you want to hide, wrap it up with a fabric medical bandage. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you can always tape a large gauze pad over the tattoo with medical tape. [7] X Research source Come up with a quick excuse you can throw out there if anyone asks about your bandage. Something like “I just cut myself shaving,” or, “My friend’s cat scratched me,” will work just fine. This isn’t a great option if you’re planning on doing this every day for work or if you’re trying to hide a tattoo from your family. People will eventually ask questions if they see you wearing a bandage in the same place every day."

      "content": "If you have long hair, let it down to cover upper back and neck tats. If you have a tattoo behind one of your ears, let your hair fall to that side so that it covers up your ink. If you have a tattoo on the back of your neck, skip the ponytail and keep your hair down to obscure it entirely. If you have shorter hair but want to do this in the future, skip your next 2-3 trips to the salon to grow your hair out. If you’re going to be spending time outside on a windy day, use hair spray, mousse, or hair gel to hold your hair in place so that you don’t accidentally show off your ink."

      "content": "Throw on a few bangles or bracelets to cover up a wrist tattoo. If you’re looking for a less noticeable or more gender-neutral option, a nice watch can cover up your wrist as well. You can also throw on a choker or thick necklace to hide a small neck tattoo. Big rings are a great way to cover up small tattoos on your fingers. [8] X Research source If you aren’t heading into the office or going to a formal event, you can use thick athletic wristbands to cover up tattoos on your forearms. It may not cover your tattoos, but wearing a ton of accessories can visually draw the eye away from a small tattoo. Throwing on a statement necklace and few fancy bracelets can distract people from looking at a small tattoo you can’t cover up."

      "content": "If you’re always hiding your tattoo, it may worth getting it removed. If your ink was a teenage mistake or a sign of devotion to a now ex-boyfriend, go see a dermatologist and ask them to take a look at it. They’ll be able to tell you if laser removal, surgical removal, or dermabrasion is the best option for you depending on your skin. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Laser removal is the most popular option. A laser removal specialist will numb and heat your skin with a high-powered laser to break the ink up. It can take multiple sessions to fully remove a tattoo. The doctor will cut the tattoo out and stitch your skin back up. It will leave a scar behind, but it’s occasionally the only option for tattoos that are super deep in your skin. Dermabrasion is where a doctor numbs your skin and sands the skin down to remove the layer with ink in it. It isn’t a popular method, but it may be ideal depending on your ink."

[10] X Research source Reach out to a tattoo artist who specializes in cover-ups and show them your ink. They’ll be able to walk you through your options based on the color, size, and style of the original tattoo. There’s a special art to this since you have to take the original tattoo into account while you’re planning the cover-up, so work with a tattoo artist with experience in this. Depending on the original tat, the artist may be able to add and build off of the original tattoo to make it look like something else entirely. If not, you’ll need to get a bigger, darker tattoo to cover it up."
