      "content": "Go completely casual with a cute gray sweat set. Channel the spirit of the OG groutfit trend with a low-key combination of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. It’s an easy outfit to throw on when you’re running errands, going to a morning class, or heading to the gym. Add white (or gray) sneakers to complete the look."

      "content": "Turn workwear into streetwear oversized gray tailored pieces. Pair your favorite baggy light gray trousers with a fitted white turtleneck and a slouchy dark gray blazer. Accessorize with a thin black belt, black sneakers, and a cross-body purse with a black or gray strap. The resulting look is not quite as casual as the classic groutfit, but not too formal because of the relaxed silhouette. For men wanting to try this groutfit, stylist Susan Kim advises layering a turtleneck with a slim fit blazer to achieve the most flattering look."

      "content": "Wear a monochrome co-ord skirt set to elevate the low-effort groutfit. This look is perfect for warmer fall days when pants and a jacket would be stuffy. Choose a co-ord with a mini skirt to emphasize your height, or opt for a midi skirt and tank set to channel a ‘90s vibe. Kim says that fit and fabric choice are key to finding the right skirt for your body type. “If you have wider hips and you want to accentuate that, then I would go with more elastic fabrication,” she explains. Looking for a more conservative look? Choose “a looser fit” in linen or cotton material—”because [that kind of fabric] hugs your body, but doesn't show too much of everything.”"

      "content": "Pair gray plaid trousers with a matching sweater for a dark-academia look. This is a more office-friendly take on the groutfit. Choose tailored, wide-leg plaid trousers and a thick matching sweater for the most cohesive look. Accessorize with shiny gray pumps and your favorite gradient sunglasses for a chic, put-together ensemble."

      "content": "Layer a long gray coat over a subtle groutfit for a sleek look. Turn your groutfit into a major street-style moment with the right flowy, light gray coat that will ripple in the wind. To keep this look from appearing lazy, pair a pale gray V-neck bodysuit with high-waisted, flared linen pants for a sleek monochromatic combo. Finish the groutfit with slate-gray heels or ankle booties."

      "content": "Combine a dark-gray skirt with a light-gray top for a fun contrast. Mixing shades of gray adds visual interest to even the most basic silhouettes. A dark gray wool tea skirt and a simple light gray top (short or long-sleeved, depending on the weather) will help you exude elegance. Rock this look on a date night with black slingback heels or flats."

      "content": "Turn a gray sweater dress into a statement groutfit with knee-high black boots. The sweater dress is a fall-fashion staple. Turn it into a sophisticated groutfit by cinching a thin black belt to accentuate your waist, and throwing on a pair of knee-high black boots. This groutfit may not be office-friendly, but it’s a cute look for holiday shopping and grabbing hot chocolate with friends. Torn about which boots to buy? Image consultant Ashley Kahn is a supporter of all things leather, calling the material her “favorite fall staple.” When it comes to leather boots, “faux is good, but getting real leather—especially with your shoes—they're going to last forever.”"

      "content": "Upgrade dark gray knit pants and a sweater with a light cashmere coat. If you struggle to think of sophisticated groutfit ideas for men or people with masculine style, this look is for you. Start with a pair of dark gray trousers and a matching dark gray sweater. Add a luxe, light gray cashmere coat and shiny black Oxfords for a contrast that elevates the look from basic to sharp. Buying quality cashmere pieces can be pricey—but image consultant Kathi Burns, CPO® says it’s a worthwhile investment. “If you pick up one nice piece of cashmere, it'll last you for decades. You can find a very lightweight cashmere sweater, wrap, or poncho. Put it over anything and you're toasty warm without looking really bulky.”"

      "content": "Gather all the gray clothing and shoes you have. Before you rush to the store to buy new clothing, see if you can fit the trend using items you already have. Lay out your gray clothes on your bed or couch to see what your options are. Line gray shoes up on the floor. Decide if you want to mix shades or go monochromatic so you can match items that are the same type of gray. Want to separate the casual gray garments from the more refined ones? According to stylist Candace Hanna, elegant fabrics include silk, wool, and raw satin. Set gray pieces in these fabrics aside to use to style dressier groutfits."

      "content": "Try on different groutfits and pick your favorite. Experiment with different lengths, thicknesses, and fabric types. Take into account the weather and the formalness of where you’re going—including any work or school dress codes. Since the groutfit is coming back in time for fall and winter fashion, don’t be afraid to layer tops, sweaters, and jackets, or skirts and tights. If you’re new to layering, image consultant Nejla Renee has an easy-to-follow formula: “Start with fitted, thinner fabrics as your base and build on that, layering heavier and looser on top. Also, don’t be afraid to mix textures and fits.”"

      "content": "Accessorize to dress your groutfit up or down. Heels will always add dressiness—as long as you don’t have to walk too much. Even with a more comfortable groutfit, like a pants-and-sweater combo or a sweater dress, a cinched belt can make your ensemble feel more polished. Don’t forget gray or black purses, hats, and scarves. Hanna shares that finding your individual style is “about understanding your preferences, what you love, and what you feel your best in, as opposed to [...] what the world is telling you that you're supposed to feel great in.” So, when creating a groutfit, put your personal preferences ahead of what’s ‘in.’"

As long as you’re dressing up in tailored, dressy pieces with thoughtful accessorizing and layering, a groutfit can be office-appropriate. Always double-check your workplace’s dress policies if you’re unsure what’s allowed or considered professional."
