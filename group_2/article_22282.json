Avoiding certain types of beverages and food can help to heal the inflammation, reduce your pain, and reduce the amount of time you suffer. In order to lessen irritation, avoid hot beverages and foods as well as foods that salty, spicy, or have citrus elements. These can increase the irritation to the mouth tissue.

      "content": "Take care of yeast infections. Yeast infections of the mouth can cause thrush to the tongue, which is when the fungus candida, the fungus behind vaginal yeast infections, occurs in the mouth. Thrush can cause an inflammatory response and pain in your mouth. [4] X Research source Thrush can also cause mouth ulcers. [5] X Research source Healing inflammation from a yeast infection will require medication from your physician. These medications can be used in otherwise healthy adults and children for 10 to 14 days and come in lozenges, liquid, or pill form. However, children and adults with a weakened immune system require different help. [6] X Research source"

These drugs kill the fast growing cells but do not specifically target cancer cells, which means they can also kill the cells in your mouth, which grow and replicate quickly. These sores are painful and can last for more than two weeks. Sores from these medications may require topical painkillers applied directly to the mouth sores. These medication can also numb your mouth, so use caution when eating or brushing your teeth after you apply them.

      "content": "Learn about gingivitis. Gingivitis and periodontal disease are irritations and infections of the gum tissue, which cause an inflammatory response and pain. Gingivitis occurs when plaque is not cleaned from your teeth. This causes harmful bacteria, which causes the gums to become red, swollen, and bleed easily. Periodontal disease can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth and form spaces or pockets that become further infected. Bacterial toxins and your body's natural responses can break down the connective tissue between the gums and bone, which cause inflammation and pain. [12] X Research source"

After the procedure, you may experience less bleeding and swelling, but you will still have to continue good oral hygiene at home. If the infection is advanced, your dentist may prescribe antibiotics to help reduce the infection, which will also reduce the inflammation. If medications and cleaning are not sufficient your physician may recommend surgical procedures to clean the teeth closer to the root and help regenerate bone and connective tissue.

      "title": "Treat the cavities.",
      "content": "Treat the cavities. The inflammation and discomfort caused by cavities cannot be healed until you fill the cavity. To treat cavities, your dentist will likely give you fillings. Fillings are made from tooth-colored composite resins, porcelain, or silver amalgam. Silver amalgam fillings contain mercury, but they are considered safe by the FDA. However, if you have an allergy to any of the components of amalgam fillings (silver, tin, copper, or mercury), then you may develop oral lesions as a result. Tell your dentist about any allergies you have. If your tooth decay is advanced, you may need a crown. These are custom fitted fake caps that cover the tops of the teeth. A root canal may also be needed to repair or save a damaged or infected tooth, instead of removing it. If the tooth is too damaged, pulling the tooth may be necessary. If you have to have it pulled, you may need a bridge or replacement tooth to keep your other teeth from shifting.

      "content": "Prevent future cold sores. Cold sores need arginine to develop. Arginine is an amino acid found in foods such as walnuts, chocolate, sesame seeds, and soy. [21] X Research source To prevent additional cold cores, avoid these foods. Instead, eat foods with the amino acid lysine, which counteracts the influence of arginine with cold sores. Foods high in lysine include red meat, pork, poultry, cheeses, eggs, and brewer's yeast. Pay attention to your lysine to arginine ratio to help prevent the appearance of more cold sores in the future. You can also take an oral supplement of lysine daily. Dosing will depend upon several factors, so discuss your intentions with your physician. [22] X Research source"

You can help prevent yeast infections by brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing once a day, reducing or eliminating the use of mouth wash, and not sharing any eating utensils that may pass the infection from one person to another. If you have diabetes or wear dentures, take special care of your oral hygiene as these are possible triggers for a yeast infection. Limit the amount of sugar or foods that contain yeast that you eat. Yeast requires sugar to multiply and grow. Foods with yeast include bread, beer, and wine, which can encourage the growth of yeast. [23] X Research source"

If they are persistent, the sores may be cancer, which is an uncontrollable growth of the cells that invade other areas and cause damage to the surrounding tissue.
