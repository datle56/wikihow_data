      "content": "Change your water. The only safe level of ammonia is zero. If your test kit detects any amount of ammonia, you need to perform a water change. This process can take several days. Changing the water is the only safe way to lower ammonia levels. Products that promise to remove ammonia might have negative side effects, so they should be avoided. A water change means that you will remove 20% of the water in the tank. Use a clean bucket or jug to remove the water. If your fish are very stressed, check the pH. If itâ€™s no more than a point difference of what the new water is, you can change half of the water. Replace the water with fresh water. Use dechlorinated tap water. Continue changing the water over the next 2-3 days until there is no trace of ammonia. You do not need to remove your fish or any plants that are in your tank."

Closely monitor the levels of ammonia, nitrate, and pH. Keeping careful records can help you notice changes and correct the levels as fast as possible. You can write down all of the chemical levels in your water. You can also note factors such as temperature level and population statistics. There are many websites and apps that can help you monitor your tank. Some sites offer basic memberships for free. [2] X Research source Other sites are more sophisticated.

It will also remove floating debris from your tank. Purchase the best filter for your tank. Filters come in many sizes and price ranges, so do your research. Read reviews online. You should also talk to experienced employees at your local pet store. Power filters are commonly used for tanks up to 55 gallons. They are used to increase biological filtration, which means you can keep more fish in your tank. If your tank is larger than 55 gallons, consider getting a Canister filter. They are the most powerful and effective for large tanks."

When you are setting up a new tank, introduce fish slowly. Add tropical fish to your tank in small groups. Monitor the water to make sure that the ammonia levels are remaining steady. Ammonia is lethal, so try to keep your levels as close to zero as possible. 0 is the ideal level of ammonia in a fish tank."

      "content": "Know the signs of a problem. In addition to checking your water, you can look for other symptoms that your ammonia levels are too high. The primary symptom is the death of a new fish. If you add a new fish to a previously healthy tank, that fish might be reacting to unexpected ammonia. [3] X Research source Fish who are suffering from ammonia poisoning have trouble getting oxygen they need from the water. Ammonia causes fish gills to stick together and fish can't breathe. On many tropical fish, you can visually see their gills moving. If you can't see the gills moving anymore, your fish might be in distress. Non-lethal levels of ammonia can still be a problem. Fish exposed to ammonia will experience stress and might behave differently than usual. They may swim faster than usual or appear erratic in their movements."
