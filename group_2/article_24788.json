      "title": "Add a layer of satin or gloss Mod Podge to your craft.",
      "content": "Add a layer of satin or gloss Mod Podge to your craft. Use a foam brush or paintbrush, depending on your craft, and lightly brush a thorough layer of Mod Podge onto the surface area of whatever you are looking to cover in glitter. Make sure the entire area is coated and that there are no bare spots. You can even make your own Mod Podge at home to save money! If you don’t have Mod Podge, you could also use regular white school glue, though school glue often chips off easily over time. Fun ideas of things you can add glitter to: plates, mugs, containers, candles, fabric flowers, glasses frames, cell phone covers, wood, and notebooks or folders."

      "title": "Dust, pour, or poof the glitter over the Mod Podged area.",
      "content": "Dust, pour, or poof the glitter over the Mod Podged area. Depending on the kind of glitter you are using, you might apply it in a slightly different way. The main thing to remember is that you want to completely coat the Mod Podge in glitter and not leave any empty spaces. [1] X Research source You can also use a foam brush to spread on your glitter if you want a little more control over how much you use. If you are looking for a high-glitter outcome, you can apply a second layer of Mod Podge and glitter immediately after the first one without waiting for it to dry first (it will take a little longer to dry after the second coat, then, but it will be highly glitterized)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow the glitter and Mod Podge to dry for 1-2 hours.",
      "content": "Allow the glitter and Mod Podge to dry for 1-2 hours. Leave your newly glittered item alone for several hours or until it is dry to the touch. Try to leave it in a position so that the Mod Podge and glitter isn’t touching any other surface. If you are adding glitter to multiple items, this is a great time to continue working on those projects while you’re waiting for others to dry."

    {
      "title": "Apply a top layer of Mod Podge to seal in the glitter.",
      "content": "Apply a top layer of Mod Podge to seal in the glitter. Once the first layer is dry to the touch, use your sponge or paint brush to add another thin layer of Mod Podge to your item. Use long, even strokes to reduce the appearance of brush lines. Make sure you cover the entire item and don’t leave any raw glitter poking through. You could also use watered down school glue to create an opaque sealant for your crafting project. The top layer of Mod Podge acts as a sealant and will prevent the glitter from flaking away."

      "title": "Let your finished craft dry for 3-4 hours before you use it.",
      "content": "Let your finished craft dry for 3-4 hours before you use it. Depending on how thickly you applied the Mod Podge, you may need to wait anywhere from 3-12 hours before you can safely use the item without potentially messing up the application. Always check the directions on the bottle for tips and guidelines. [2] X Research source If you have a dehumidifier, you can set your craft in front of it for a speedier drying time. Never place your item directly in front of a heat source, like an electric heater or a hair dryer, as this may cause the Mod Podge to melt or change consistency so it doesn’t dry correctly."

      "content": "Coat flaking items with sparkle Mod Podge to seal in the glitter. If you have an item that has glitter that is flaking off, you can apply pre-glitterized Mod Podge to add back some sparkle and lock in the remaining glitter. Simply use a sponge or paint brush to apply a thin, even coat of the sealant to the item, then let it fully dry before you use it again. [3] X Research source Make sure to work on a protected surface, like a counter covered in newspaper or paper towels."

      "content": "Mix Mod Podge with your glitter of choice for a stronger glitter look. Pour some Mod Podge into a disposable cup or bowl and mix in as much glitter as you want to make your own glitter sealant. You can make the glitter as weak or as strong as you prefer. Then follow the instructions to apply the Mod Podge and let it dry. [4] X Research source You can also apply your glitter Mod Podge, another layer of glitter, and then top it off with the glitter Mod Podge again for even more glitter fun."

      "content": "Combine body oil and loose glitter for an all-body glitter-wearing option. Instead of sprinkling loose body glitter on your arms and hoping it doesn’t fall off, combine body oil and loose glitter in a travel-sized shampoo container. Shake the container up really well, and then apply it to your arms, legs, chest, or face whenever you need an extra glitter boost. [5] X Research source While you could purchase body oils or lotions that already have glitter in them, it can be less expensive and more fun to do it yourself."

      "title": "Put petroleum jelly on your skin and add body glitter for a sparkly look.",
      "content": "Put petroleum jelly on your skin and add body glitter for a sparkly look. Use a clean makeup or paint brush and apply an even layer of the petroleum jelly to the area you want to cover in glitter (like your collar bones, shoulders, or even your hairline). Then use another clean brush or your hand to gently press loose body glitter onto the jelly. [6] X Research source Visit a cosmetics store to buy body-specific glitter, which is usually a slightly different consistency than the glitter used for crafting. If you don’t have petroleum jelly, you could also use hair gel as the sticky base for your body glitter. Use this method in areas that aren’t going to come into frequent contact with other surfaces. For example, it probably wouldn’t work well on your legs if you are going to be sitting and standing and walking around often."

      "content": "Mix hairspray and glitter to create glitter brow and hair gel. Spray hairspray into a dish, like a small cup or bowl (or even a disposable Dixie Cup), and add loose glitter. Mix it around with a toothpick or a spoolie brush, and then apply it carefully to your eyebrows or to select strands of your hair. [7] X Research source Do not use the glitter and hairspray mix on your eyelashes as it could irritate or infect them."

      "content": "Wear vibrant lipstick and then add loose glitter for a shimmery lip look. Steer clear of sticky or glossy lipsticks and stick with a cream base to keep the glitter in place better. Put on a layer or two or lipstick, then use your fingers to gently press loose glitter into your lips. With this trend, you’ll want to avoid pressing your lips together or eating or drinking anything too messy."

      "content": "Create a glitter stamp from a makeup sponge and loose glitter. Cut a makeup sponge into a fun shape (like a heart or a star) and dip one side of it carefully into loose glitter. Spread a thin layer of petroleum jelly or hair gel on your body where you want the stamp, and then press the makeup sponge onto the jelly to transfer the glitter. [8] X Research source Your glitter stamp should stay on all day as long as it doesn’t brush up roughly against anything else."

      "content": "Use hairspray for a quick fix on your glitter clothing. Take your item of clothing outdoors or to a well ventilated area, and lay it down completely flat. Then spray a light coat of hairspray overtop of the glitter. Use unscented hairspray if you can. Allow the hairspray to dry completely before you wear the clothing item. [9] X Research source Hairspray is a great, quick fix, but overtime it doesn’t hold up, though you can reapply hairspray when you need to. Long-term, you just have to care for and store glittery clothes very carefully."

Then, carefully shake loose glitter overtop of the glue, coating it so that none of the glue is visible. Let the glue and glitter dry for several hours before picking up the item and shaking off the excess glitter. [10] X Research source You could even make a stamp out of a sponge and decorate your shirt that way (like stars all over a t-shirt), and then shake the glitter on top of the design."

      "content": "Wash glittery clothes sparingly and let them air-dry. When you go to clean your clothes that have glitter on them, try to wash then only when they really need it. Use cold water and the delicate cycle in the washing machine, and don’t put them into the dryer. Instead, hang them up to air-dry. [11] X Research source You could even take your glittery clothes to a dry cleaner instead of washing them yourself."
