      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and stand your ice cream cones up in a muffin tin. Each well gets one ice cream cone. If you cannot fit all of your ice cream cones into the muffin tin, set them aside; you can bake them in a separate batch. Some bakers recommend cutting holes into the bottom of an aluminum foil baking tin, turning the tin upside down, and sticking the cones into the holes. Use ice cream cones that have a flat bottom as opposed to the ones that are cone-shaped; they will stand up better."
