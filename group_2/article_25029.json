      "content": "Use a humidifier. You can use either a cool water humidifier or a vaporizer. When the air is very dry, any increase in humidity will help prevent a nosebleed. Moistening the air at night will also make it easier to breathe and sleep. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a commercial humidifier, you can make one by putting a pot of water on the radiator/heating in the winter. The water will slowly evaporate over time, increasing the humidity in the air."

      "content": "Try a stovetop steam treatment. Boil a pot of water, then put it on the kitchen table with a thick cork pot coaster or potholder underneath to protect the table from the heat. Lean over the pot, being careful not to burn yourself, and inhale the steam. You can also use a towel to make a tent over the pot and your nose. This will maximize the amount of steam you inhale. You can also get steam from a hot shower or bath, but the hot water can also be dehydrating, which is counterproductive. Run a hot shower and wash yourself quickly so that your skin doesn't dry out, but then step outside the stream of water or even outside the bath and inhale the steam."

      "content": "Moisten your mucous membranes with nasal saline spray. The active ingredients are simple: just salt and water. [5] X Research source You can purchase it over the counter without a prescription. Then, if your nose feels dry, give it a quick spray. Put 1–2 drops of spray into each nostril every 2–4 hours so you don’t lose any moisture. If it is just salt and water, it is safe, won't irritate your mucous membranes, and shouldn't cause side effects. This is excellent in winter during flu season. You can bring a small bottle of saline spray with you to use at work and in the car. You can use it three times a day if you need to. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some commercial saline sprays have preservatives in them which may irritate your membranes; however, the preservatives also prevent the growth of bacteria and other contaminants. Check the ingredients on the packaging. If it contains preservatives or ingredients other than salt and water, then be very careful not to use it more often than recommended by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions. If you want to use preservative-free saline, find one that uses a no backflow method or has a more acid pH to decrease bacteria. You can make a homemade saline solution, but it can be difficult to get the proper balance of salt to water, which can lead to dry sinuses. But, if you have no other choice, you can try making your own saline. Add a teaspoon of salt to a quart of water. Then boil it for 20 minutes to sterilize it.
