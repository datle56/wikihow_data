      "title": "Check with your parents.",
      "content": "Check with your parents. Before you make a definite decision about graduating early, be sure to talk with your parents or guardians. In order to graduate early, you might need to attend online courses, start a homeschooling program, or enroll at a community college. [6] X Research source These options can be difficult for some families to accommodate, so be sure to ask your parents or guardians for their help with planning. You may also need a signature from a parent or guardian showing consent for early graduation from your high school or for enrollment into accelerated graduation programs."

      "content": "Analyze your work and extracurricular activity schedule. Graduating early will likely require a major increase in your study and homework load. This means that you may not have as much time for work or extracurricular activities as you did in regular high school. Be sure that less work and play fits into your financial, recreation, and social goals. [9] X Research source If you plan to get into college with a scholarship for sports or a high school club activity (like science club), be sure that you’ll still be eligible with early graduation and have time to qualify or participate with an increased study and homework schedule."

      "content": "Enroll in online high school. Attending traditional high school takes up a lot of time that isn’t necessarily used for actual class time.

Attending an online high school may allow you to get more coursework done in the same amount of time you spend at regular school. [11] X Research source You can find online high schools through an internet search.

[13] X Research source The advantage of homeschooling is that you can learn at your own pace using your own personal learning style. However, you do need a parent, guardian, or supervisor to help manage your work and do the grading. Homeschooling can be expensive because you have to buy all the learning materials and pay for testing at independent centers to receive accredited graduation certificates. If your parents don’t have time to help homeschool you, search online for local homeschooling groups that may allow you to join them."

GED study classes (both online and in person) are widely available, but they should not be taken in lieu of actual high school classes (if possible) because you could miss out on important college prep. Getting your GED is a way to have the equivalent of a high school diploma, but the test is usually much harder than high school exams.

Not only do the programs cost money, but learning materials (like textbooks) and transportation (like a school bus) are not usually included. Make a list of expenses. Talk to your parents to see if they can help you with finances. Search online for local scholarships you might be able to apply for. Check your eligibility for student loans."
