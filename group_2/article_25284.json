      "content": "Pay attention to your body as you approach puberty. Puberty brings about many changes physically and mentally, as well as emotionally. Your body goes through hormonal changes, and you will notice your body slowly changing from a child’s body into an adult’s body. If you’re wondering whether you’re becoming a teenager yet, just look at your body! Most males begin puberty between ages nine and 15, while most females begin earlier: between ages eight and 13. [1] X Research source You might feel awkward or embarrassed at first, but this is a natural process, and you will eventually become comfortable with your body."

      "title": "Notice if you’re experiencing mood swings.",
      "content": "Notice if you’re experiencing mood swings. Your brain and hormones are going through puberty along with your physical body, and they will experience changes as well. Expect an occasional mood swing: one minute you’ll feel happy, then you’ll feel angry or sad, and then happy again. This is typical; your body is going through hormonal changes and this is how your brain manages all the mental and physical changes of puberty. This is a common first step as you approach puberty. If you notice yourself experiencing frequent mood swings, puberty is just around the corner. If you notice an increase in negative thoughts or are occupied with thoughts of harming yourself or others, talk to your parents or to your school counselor as soon as possible."

      "content": "Wash your face twice daily to reduce acne . During puberty, hormonal changes going on in your body will stimulate oil glands under the surface of your skin. This will make your skin feel more greasy, as more oil is pushed to the surface. [2] X Research source As a result, outbreaks of pimples are likely to increase, especially if you have poor facial hygiene. To help prevent serious acne: Wash your face with lukewarm water and a gentle facial cleanser twice a day to keep the pimples from showing up and getting bigger. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Drink more water so that your body can flush out toxins. Acne can also be genetic. If you start noticing an increase in pimples, ask your parents if they suffered from many outbreaks during puberty. You may wish to see a dermatologist for additional skin care."

      "content": "Watch for hair in your pubic area and expect more body hair in general. Hair will start to grow in your groin, just like under your armpits. In fact, hair will often start to grow in both places around the same time — early in puberty, often around age nine.

      "content": "Get ready for growth spurts. Puberty brings about frequent growth spurts as your body grows into that of an adult. [5] X Research source While growth can occasionally be physically painful, a larger concern — especially for parents — is that you will quickly outgrow your clothes and shoes until your growth spurts have stopped. Since everyone begins puberty at different times, some teenagers will begin their growth spurts before their peers. This is normal, even if it’s sometimes a little socially awkward. Young women will notice their hips becoming wider and will begin to develop breasts. Young men will notice their shoulders becoming broader and their chests filling out. [6] X Research source"

Try to talk about it with your parents/guardian, family members, or another adult you trust. Remember, they’ve all been through it. It’s also a good idea to visit your doctor yearly while you are going through puberty. He will make sure you are healthy and can answer any questions you may have."

[7] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Many people with breasts find that their breasts develop unevenly; one may grow more rapidly than the other. Don’t be alarmed; this is a normal part of puberty, and they’ll even out with time. This process often causes some soreness around your developing breasts — don’t be concerned, this is normal."

Your armpits will produce more sweat as well, even if you’re not exercising. Most adolescents begin wearing deodorant during puberty, to prevent any unpleasant body-odor smells that may develop. It's also important to bathe or shower daily. Many people begin to shave their armpit hair. This is a fine thing to do, especially if you consider this hair to be unattractive or uncomfortable."

      "content": "Expect to start menstruating once you have entered puberty. One of the major signs of puberty in females is menstruation, which usually begins one to three years after you first begin puberty. [8] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source If you often find little brown-reddish spots or a white or dark fluid in your underwear, be prepared for your first menstruation to begin soon. Menstruation is a monthly process that many people experience. Each month, an egg from one of your ovaries will descend to your uterus, only to be shed along with the inner lining of your womb. The eggs and uterine lining exit through your vagina, and this process causes monthly bleeding. It helps to have a box of sanitary pads ready in advance. If you’re uncertain about how to use them, you can ask your parent/guardian or a sibling to show you. You may want to have one or two in your backpack or locker at school in case your period begins at school. Your periods may be inconsistent or widely spaced out at first. As you age, they will happen monthly, but at first, you may only have a period once every six months.

Shaving your face can seem dangerous or difficult at first; if you’re concerned, have one of your parents show you how to shave."
