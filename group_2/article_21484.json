Once the nut has sprouted and started to grow roots, gently wrap a damp paper towel around the roots and place the seed back into the bag. [4] X Research source The seed will be fully developed when the sprout is approximately as long as your finger and the roots have reached a length of 6 inches (15 cm) to 8 inches (20 cm).

[6] X Research source If you plan on planting your coconut outside, you do not need to use premixed soil. Find a place outside that has loose, well-draining soil. [7] X Research source You can also buy a specialized potting soil, such as Kokohum."

If you are planting your tree inside, use a pot that is at least 10 inches (25 cm) deep and has a diameter large enough to accommodate the seed. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Give your coconut tree plenty of water and sunlight. Water the tree at least 2 times per week so the soil is moist but not too wet. [10] X Research source Make sure that the tree gets lots of light, but not constant brightness. Some shade is preferable. [11] X Research source For outdoor plants, you can make a mini greenhouse. Put bamboo stakes into the ground around the tree. Wrap plastic wrap around the sticks and across the top. Remove the greenhouse when the tree is 1 foot (0.30 m) tall. [12] X Research source Keep indoor trees moist by spraying both sides of the leaves with water."
