      "content": "Ask yourself certain questions. After you've been cheated on , the first step is evaluating the relationship and determining whether or not it's worth it to you to stay. You need to ask yourself certain questions to make this decision. Be as honest as possible with yourself. Has your girlfriend cheated in the past? For some, cheating is a compulsive behavior that happens again and again. If the problem is less rooted in this specific relationship and more grounded in a problem your girlfriend has with fidelity that is not personal, the cheating may be easier to accept and get past. [1] X Research source Why did your girlfriend cheat? While some might say cheating is cheating, end of story, the fact is the reasons behind infidelity mean a lot. A one night, purely physical slip up may be far easier to forgive than a longterm affair in which your girlfriend became emotionally attached to someone else. Try to put yourself in your girlfriend's shoes and question how you would have felt in her position. [2] X Research source What was the state of your relationship when the cheating occurred? If the relationship was in a rough patch, and you knew your girlfriend was unhappy, cheating may be easier to understand. Were you two taking each other for granted ? Did she need emotional needs filled outside the relationship? If so, can these problems be fixed or should you both sever ties and move on? [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn about sexual compulsivity. Educating yourself on the factors that encourage cheating can make understanding and forgiving your girlfriend easier. If your girlfriend has cheated on other partners, learn about sexual compulsion and its causes. Compulsive sexual behavior is a term applied to a wide variety of sexuality activity that falls outside societal norms including some forms of infidelity. Infidelity is usually only considered a compulsive sexual behavior if it is a pattern of behavior that a person engaged in without thought and at great personal risk. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your girlfriend has cheated on partners in the past, she may be doing so compulsively. Once you've had time to calm down, ask your girlfriend whether she feels she has any control over her sexual impulses and if she gets any pleasure out of her sexual experiences. If the answer is no, she may have a disorder that requires psychiatric treatment. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Remember, not all cheating is compulsive. It's important not to automatically define infidelity as a disorder. If your girlfriend cheated because of an issue in your relationship, or if she is polyamorous and is not interested in a monogamous relationship, accusing her of having a disorder can come off as insensitive. She might feel like you're being judgmental and ignoring other, more relevant issues that caused her to cheat."

      "content": "Reach out to others. It can be difficult to sort through the emotional impact of cheating on your own. Reach out to friends and family members to help talk through and better understand your feelings. Talk to friends and family members you trust, who you know will refrain from judgment. Tell them about what occurred and ask for emotional support. People may offer advice, but politely tell them you're merely trying to figure out your own feelings and do not need instructions on how to proceed.

It's okay to reach out to others, but do not tell your girlfriend's mother, best friend, or co-worker about your relationship issues.

      "content": "Consider an open relationship . Some people are polyamorous. This means they struggle to stay with a single partner and may want someone open to seeking sex and romance outside a single relationship. If your girlfriend falls into this category, consider whether or not you could handle an open relationship. Polyamorous and open relationships come in many forms. Some people merely seek out sexual relationships outside of their boyfriend or girlfriend while others may want to have multiple sexual and romantic partners at the same time. Decide what form of an open relationship, if any, you are comfortable with before pursuing one. [8] X Research source Communication is key to a successful open relationship. In the poly community, a lot of emphasis is put on discussing boundaries, respect, and expectations. If you want to try to open things up, make sure you and your girlfriend have many long talks about what an open relationship means for the two of you. [9] X Research source Remember, there is nothing wrong with not wanting an open relationship. When it comes to monogamy, there is no wrong way to feel. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of an open relationship, pursuing one can be damaging to you. If you and your girlfriend have different ideas about monogamy, this may be a sign you're not compatible longterm."

      "content": "Have an open, honest talk. You need to discuss what happened with your girlfriend. Whether you decide to work things out or not, an open and honest talk is important for closure. Listen when your girlfriend talks, even if it's hard. Use verbal and non-verbal cues to show her you're paying attention. Keep eye contact, lean forward, nod and occasionally make a comment when there is a pause. Avoid noise barriers, such as choosing a loud coffee shop to converse. This can make effective communication difficult. [11] X Research source Asking meaningful questions. What issues cause conflict between you and your girlfriend? What causes disappointment, pain? What kinds of things made you happy and helped you feel connected? How would you like communication to be different between you and your girlfriend? [12] X Research source Be respectful . This will be a painful discussion for both of you and you need to converse in a civil, productive manner. Speak politely. Begin sentences with \"I\" instead of \"you\" to avoid sounding accusatory. Take turns speaking and try not to dwell on a topic for too long. If you've been discussing one issue for more than 15 minutes, it might be time to move on and revisit that topic later.

Sometimes, needs or desires are mutually exclusive and cheating is often driven by this fact. If your girlfriend has different sexual desires or a different sexual appetite, the two of you may simply not be compatible. If you firmly believe in monogamy and your girlfriend wants an open relationship, it is also probably time to move on. [16] X Research source Boredom is another factor that leads to relationships ending. Discovering new things about your partner is vital to a long lasting relationship, but if you've both stopped growing during the course of your romance it's a sign things are simply not working anymore. Lack of continued interest and personal growth are both signs a relationship does not have a future. [17] X Research source Conversely, if you and your girlfriend are able to find a place where you both feel happy and comfortable, without compromising anyone's vital needs, you may be able to continue the relationship. However, move forward knowing that tension and lack of trust will be major issues after infidelity. It will take a long time for things to feel normal again.
