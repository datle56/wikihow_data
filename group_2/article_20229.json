      "content": "Approach one of your airline’s designated self-service kiosks. Once you’re in the correct airport terminal, locate your airline. In most airports, these kiosks are clustered in groups directly in front of the check-in counters at major airlines. These stand-alone computers – usually with touch screens – have scanners and print-out slots below the screen. If you see an open one, make your way over to it. On a busy day, you’ll have to wait in line for a kiosk to become available. [1] X Research source If you aren’t sure which terminal to go to, first look at your booking confirmation documents for the name of your airline. Then you can find the correct terminal for this airline’s departures which will be noted on an airport map or website and on road signs leading up to the airport itself. Note that sometimes domestic and international departures will be at different terminals, even for the same airline. The self-service kiosks look and function similar to ATMs and other ticketing machines. Airline agents are typically standing by to provide assistance, should you need it."

      "title": "Enter your identifying passenger information.",
      "content": "Enter your identifying passenger information. The kiosk screen will prompt you to enter a code or scan a document to identify yourself. An easy code to use is the record locator, usually a 6-digit alphanumeric code that will be clearly identified in your confirmation documents. You may also be able to enter your frequent flyer ID number, another booking confirmation number, scan your passport, or swipe the credit or debit card you used when booking your flight. [3] X Research source You should have one (or more) of these ID methods at the ready when you approach the counter. For instance, you could jot down the record locator before you leave for the airport, or use your smartphone to take a screenshot of the confirmation email where this code is listed."

It may also list your name and those of your fellow passengers. You’ll also be asked to approve or change your seats. Make sure everything is correct on each screen and then press a button to confirm and advance to the next step. [4] X Research source If you’d like to change your seats at this point, you’ll be shown where you’re located and which other seats are available. Typically a seat change involves an additional fee. These kiosks typically accept credit and debit cards for payment."

      "content": "Check your baggage, if applicable. If you haven’t already paid for checked baggage, you’ll be able to select the quantity of bags you want to check. Then, you can pay the fee with a debit or credit card. Many machines will print out a receipt for this transaction. [5] X Research source Some kiosks will print out an adhesive tag as well. You’ll need to secure the tag around your bag’s handle. The screen or the back side of the tag will usually show instructions for how to peel off the backing and stick the tag around your bag’s handle. As most machines don’t print off tags, you’ll take your bags to the counter to get them tagged. Some counter agents will weigh, tag, and send off your bags once you show your photo ID and boarding pass. If you tagged your own bags, or the agent returned your tagged baggage back to you, you’ll need to drop your checked bags off at the designated drop-off point. Look for signage or ask an agent to direct you to the nearest one."

Look for signage to indicate where your carrier is located, and approach the counter. On a busy day, you’ll have to wait in line behind other passengers. Make sure to factor extra time into your schedule to account for lengthy lines at the counters. [7] X Research source To find the right terminal, look up the name of your airline on your booking confirmation documents. Pull up an airport map or the airport’s website and search for this airline to see which terminal its departures are operated out of.

They’ll look up your name in the system to access your flight details. They may also ask for your record locator, flight number, or another confirmation code. [8] X Research source Oftentimes an agent will ask you about your travel details to confirm that you match the person and plan they see onscreen. Be prepared to clearly state the name of the airport at your final destination and any connecting stops along the way.

Within moments they’ll provide you with hard copies of all boarding passes for your trip. [10] X Research source With tickets in hand, you’ll be able to advance to the security screening area."

If you booked through another provider, you can simply head to your airline’s website and enter your record locator, name, and departure date to check in. [11] X Research source Generally, you’ll be asked to confirm your flight itinerary, confirm or change your seat, and pay for checked baggage. For an international flight, you may also be prompted to provide your passport number. Make sure your email address is correct. There’s a good chance your passes will be sent to you via email."

If you plan to change your seat or add a checked bag, this is the opportunity to do so. You’ll also be asked to pay additional fees for these services and any other upgrades. If you booked directly through the airline’s website, you’ll usually receive an email notifying you when it’s time to check into your flight. During check-in, many major airlines will also ask how you would like to receive flight-related notifications.
