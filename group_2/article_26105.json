      "title": "It means a person is living through the activities of someone else.",
      "content": "It means a person is living through the activities of someone else. Instead of engaging in their own interests and activities, they get enjoyment and satisfaction from seeing or hearing about what another person is doing. They often have an emotional connection and feel like they’re participating in that person’s life. Some studies have even shown that vicarious positive experiences stimulate the part of the brain associated with reward or elation. [1] X Research source Living vicariously through another person’s experiences can be harmless for a limited time or during a specific event. For example, you watch a movie, imagine yourself participating in the action, and then return to your own life when the movie ends. It can also be a useful tool to help therapists develop the empathy they need to help their clients work through emotional and psychological trauma. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The phrase is often used as a tongue-in-cheek compliment. Many people use the phrase to let a friend know that they admire some part of their lives. This admiration can be a lucky situation, a physical attribute, or a talent or skill. Even though they say they will live vicariously through you, they don’t mean it literally. “My social life consists of watching Netflix with my cat, so I’ll just live vicariously through you for all the parties you go to.” “I’m too busy to travel this summer. Please post your vacation photos so I can live vicariously through you.” “I get vertigo walking down the stairs, so I’ll just have to live vicariously through you when you’re skydiving tomorrow.”"

This causes an unhealthy relationship where the child feels they can’t live up to their parent’s expectations. [3] X Research source The parent is also disappointed because the child may not want what the parent wants and fails to achieve their parent’s goals."
