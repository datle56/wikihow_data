[1] X Research source To make a bump lock, you'll need the key from the correct manufacturer as well as a working copy of the legitimate key. There are some people making bump keys without original keys as guides. To do so, you need an electronic caliper capable of measuring the distance between pins in the lock -- a complicated maneuver reserved usually for burglars without access to an original.

      "content": "Use a fine permanent marker to trace your real key onto the blank one. You need to know where each groove is along the length of the key, as well as the maximum depth that any groove has on the key. Lay your real key over your blank key. The only difference between the two is that the real key is serrated where the blank key, your bump key, is not. You only have to trace that serrated edge. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source The maximum depth should never cross the track, which is the indent going through the length of the key."

      "content": "Stick the blank key in a bench vice. Place the key so that the track and bottom are in the vice and the top sticks out. You will need to file the key into the shape you've outlined. You can set the original key aside. If you do not have a bench vice, find another way to hold your key securely while filing it down. You must be able to file down to an accurate depth, so having it somewhere it can't move is crucial."

      "content": "Use your file to craft the bump key into a rough approximation of the original. Use the file, keeping the peaks in place. Your biggest goal is to never go lower than the maximum depth of the original. Just get the key into the rough shape of the original so you can fine-tune it into a bump key."

      "content": "Review the basic vocabulary of keys before moving forward, especially if you are new to lock-picking. This how-to will use certain terms and phrases to refer to parts of the key. Knowing the simple terms will help you make a more effective key. Length : the length of the key from its tip to the end; the longest measurement of the key. Groove : a dip or indentation in the serrated edge of the key. Each groove is next to at least one peak. Peak : a tooth in the serrated edge of the knife. Peaks can be steep or flat, but jut outwards from the body of the key. Each peak is next to at least one groove. Maximum depth : the length of the deepest groove on the key. The deepest groove should never cross the track. Track : the narrow indentation along the key's length. Different keys have differently sized tracks. The track falls roughly in the middle of the key length-wise. Shoulder : when the key is inserted, the shoulder sits at the top and right outside the lock's entrance. The shoulder stops the key from being inserted too far into the lock."

      "content": "Use a metal, triangular or taper file to grind the grooves into the bump key. The biggest thing to focus on is the depth of each groove. You never want to go past the tread running along the bottom of the key, and you never want to go deeper than the maximum depth of the original key. Do not worry about the sharp peaks between grooves for now -- they come next. You should have the same number of grooves as real the key."

      "content": "File all the steep peaks down so they are only 4-5mm above the grooves. The peaks of your blank key are probably too high and might cause your key to get stuck in the lock. File down the peaks so that they are a few millimeters high. The right height is one that triggers your lock but doesn't get stuck; you may have to experiment and practice to find the right height. [5] X Research source Your peaks should be of equal height to one another. The peaks just need to be high enough to catch in the lock."

      "content": "Use your file to clean up the key so that all the grooves and peaks are at matching heights. Your final bump key should look like a saw with an evenly serrated, jagged edge. The little, toothy peaks, shouldn't be too steep, and the grooves should be evenly spaced right where the grooves on the original key are located. It is okay if the grooves are flat-bottomed."

      "content": "Find the shoulder of the key. Insert your bump key into its respective lock, noting where the key stops it from going any further in. This is the shoulder, which exists between the grooves/peaks, and where your fingers grasp the key in order to use it. The shoulder exists to stop the entry of a key into a door at exactly the right location so that the grooves and peaks align with the lock. [6] X Research source"

Using a bump key, you want to be able to control how far the key is going into the lock to jiggle the lock open. Getting rid of the shoulder allows you to position the key as you want while tapping it in. Use your file to wear the shoulder down to the height of your peaks, at least. [7] X Research source"

If you are having trouble fitting and jiggling the key into the lock, try filing down the tip of the key by 1/4 to 1/2 of a millimeter. You will need to fit small rubber spacers on this area, allowing you to \"bump\" the key against the lock so it recoils back a bit at you. This is called the “minimal movement” method.

To use a bump key, you want bouncing rubber where a real key has a metal shoulder. This way, the key will bounce back out a little every time to hit it into the lock. A good bump key will jiggle around in the lock fluidly until it properly aligns with the lock, and will not get stuck. [11] X Research source If you do not have rubber rings, you can still test your bump key. You will have to reset the key in the lock after every time you hit it, though. This is called the “pull-back” method. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source Any little rubber ring will do. You could use gaskets from the plumbing section of a hardware store, farm equipment, and hosing."

With rubber rings, you can hit many times in quick succession. [17] X Research source Without rubber rings, you must pull your key back out one notch after pushing it in. This can get tedious, but it is not impossible. [18] X Research source"

Note, however, that improperly made or used bump keys can permanently damage locks. Only use your bump key when you are absolutely sure you need it, as it can cause more headaches than it is worth if you aren't careful. The actual \"bumping,\" or knowing how to turn the key and how hard to hit it, will take some practice. Each lock is slightly different, but you'll learn to get the feel for it with some practice."
