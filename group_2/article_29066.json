      "title": "Choose a material to work with.",
      "content": "Choose a material to work with. You can make paper bags out of just about any type of paper you want, including: brown kraft paper, patterned scrapbooking paper, and wrapping paper. Cardstock is not recommended, however, because it is too stiff. If the paper is not the right size, cut it down. Make sure that it's a rectangle. For an extra-fancy gift bag, consider using fancy wrapping paper with either glittered or flocked designs."

    {
      "title": "Decorate plain paper.",
      "content": "Decorate plain paper. If you are working with plain, solid-colored paper, such as brown kraft paper, it would be a good idea to decorate it. This will make it look more like a gift bag and less like a paper sack. Get out some paint and stencils, and add some pretty designs onto it. Alternatively, you can add a simple pattern using rubber stamps and an ink pad or acrylic paint. For a fancier touch, draw your designs with glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto them before the glue dries. Be sure to let the paper dry before moving on."

    {
      "title": "Fold the top edge down to create a seam.",
      "content": "Fold the top edge down to create a seam. Orient the paper landscape style, with the designed or decorated part facing up. Fold the top, long edge down by 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). Run your fingernail along the crease to sharpen it. For a fancier touch, trim the edge with a pair of pinking shears first, before folding it. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you. The folded part should now be flat against your work surface. Make sure that it is still along the top edge of the paper. If you are using plain paper, with neither a front or back, skip this step. The folded edge will be on the inside."

      "title": "Fold the narrow edges towards the center of the paper to make a tube.",
      "content": "Fold the narrow edges towards the center of the paper to make a tube. Overlap them by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If you'd like, you can run your fingernail along the side edges to make creases. If you'd like a more \"oval\" shaped bag, however, don't crease the sides."

      "title": "Secure the edges with glue or tape.",
      "content": "Secure the edges with glue or tape. Unfold the top flap. Run a glue stick or lay down a strip of double-sided tape along the side edge of the bottom flap. Press the top flap back down. Run your finger along the seam to seal it. If you used a glue stick, make sure that you don't get any glue on the inside of the bag."

They should be closer to each other than the sides of the bag. If your paper is thin enough, you can punch the holes through both layers of paper at the same time. Consider inserting eyelets into the holes. [5] X Research source This makes them sturdier as well as adds an element of design."

If you want to make it a rectangle, like a traditional bag, do the following: [6] X Research source Fold left and right side edges down until the base of the bag is the same width as the top. Run your fingernail along the edges to make creases. Unfold the edges and flip the bag over. Fold the sides again, and run your fingernail along the edges to make creases."
