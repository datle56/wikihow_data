Stretch the curtain out flat so you don't wrinkle it. If you don't have a large enough table, you can do this on a bed or a freshly vacuumed floor."

      "content": "Count to ensure the number of hooks matches the number of rings. You need 1 hook for each pleat, as well as one on each end. So if you have 6 pleats, you'll need 8 hooks. [1] X Research source Also, count the number of rings or gliders you have on your curtain pole or track. They should equal the number of hooks you have. [2] X Research source You can hang this type of curtain on a curtain pole with rings on it or a track with gliders on it. Check to make sure all your hooks are the same size. Squeeze them slightly together if some are larger. The smaller the opening in the front of the hook, the better your curtain will stay on its hanger."

Use a tape measure to go from the bottom of the hook to the highest point of the hardware on the wall. You need this measurement so that the curtain completely covers the hardware.

Push the sharp point of the hook into the fabric where the bottom of the hook was laying. Go through the outer fabric and the inner stuffing. Continue pushing the metal up and in until the hook is laying in the same spot you had it but with metal point inside the fabric.

If not, adjust the height by putting the hooks in a different place and repeat the process. [10] X Research source If you need to take hooks out, pull them straight down so the sharp point comes out.
