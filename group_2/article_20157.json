They are very small and inexpensive (2 to 3 dollars). Buy thin but strong rope to tie to the magnet. Also buy a telescoping magnet. They are about the width of a pen, and extend to about 2 feet (0.6 m). You will also need 1 or 2 bright flashlights, a yardstick (or broom handle), and scissors."

This is possible only if the elevators are relatively close (no more than 8 feet, most likely) by angling your flashlight so you are able to see the floor of the elevator shaft (and your keys).

      "content": "Dangle the magnet. Tie the 50 lb magnet (tightly!) to a long piece of string. You need to get the magnet beneath the elevator, dangling on the string. This is difficult, because the magnet will stick to the metal side of the elevator and the shaft. You can wrap the string around the magnet a bunch of times, stick your arm out the side of the elevator (yes, into the shaft and yes, it is scary) and throw the magnet. Don't forget to hold the string! The string should unwind and leave your magnet on the floor. If dangling doesn't work, use a long stick. Take the magnet and shove it down the shaft, along the walls to which it is sticking, with a yardstick or other long narrow object. Remember, the idea is that it should dangle."

At this point it is necessary to use the telescoping magnet."
