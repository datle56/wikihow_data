      "title": "Glue buttons or pom-poms down the center of a plain white shirt.",
      "content": "Glue buttons or pom-poms down the center of a plain white shirt. Find a plain white T-shirt that you don’t mind making into a clown costume. Find some large pom-poms or colorful buttons and line them up down the center of your shirt. Use a dab of hot glue to attach each one, then let your shirt dry for about 10 minutes. [1] X Research source If you don’t have pom-poms or buttons, that’s okay. A plain white shirt will do just fine with the rest of your costume pieces. Alternatively, wear a shirt with a bright or bold pattern."

      "title": "Glue a large bow tie to the collar of your shirt.",
      "content": "Glue a large bow tie to the collar of your shirt. Find some polka dot fabric in a bright color and fold it into a 6 by 3 in (152 by 76 mm) rectangle. Cinch the rectangle in the middle with a rubber band, then glue the bow tie to the front of your shirt right underneath the collar. Leave it to dry for about 10 minutes so that it’s really stuck. [2] X Research source You can also find premade bow ties at most party supply stores. Make the bow tie large and kind of floppy so that it adds to the clown persona."

      "title": "Find a frilly skirt or some colorful pants.",
      "content": "Find a frilly skirt or some colorful pants. For your clown bottoms, you can either throw on some rainbow, checkered, or plaid pants, or you can wear a frilly skirt made of tulle. Check in your closet or at your local thrift store to find something that a clown might wear. [3] X Research source Choose bright and colorful bottoms if you wear a white top. If you're wearing a bright, patterned top, you can wear plain or bright bottoms. Put some colorful leggings on underneath your skirt for a really eye-catching outfit."

      "title": "Wear a pair of shoes that are 2 sizes too large.",
      "content": "Wear a pair of shoes that are 2 sizes too large. Ask your older sibling, your parents, or one of your friends if you can borrow a pair of their shoes that are too big for you. Stuff the front of the shoes with newspaper until you can walk in them, then tie them up tight so they don’t slip off throughout the night. [4] X Research source You could also wear any pair of bright shoes you own or even spice up your costume by donning some rollerskates. For a cute, girly clown, stick with shoes that are your size. Then, stick a safety pin or alligator clip through a pom pom and attach it to the tip of your shoe for a rainbow addition that’s easy to remove later."

      "title": "Attach suspenders to your pants for more authenticity.",
      "content": "Attach suspenders to your pants for more authenticity. Find some brightly colored suspenders and clip them onto the waistline of your pants or skirt. Pull them up over your shoulders so that they make a border around the pom-poms or buttons down the front of your costume. [5] X Research source If you don’t have suspenders, try sewing 2 lengths of ribbon on either side of your pom-poms or buttons. Use a straight stitch, and select brightly colored ribbon, like yellow, red, or blue."

If you’re going for a more creepy, scary vibe this Halloween, grab some fake blood and dab it onto your outfit with a sponge. Focus it on the front of your shirt to make it look like you might’ve just taken a bite out of something fresh. [6] X Research source You can find costume blood at most Halloween supply stores."

      "title": "Paint your face white with face paint.",
      "content": "Paint your face white with face paint. Grab some white foundation or face paint and a sponge makeup brush. Put a thick layer of white all over your face, and drag a little bit of it down your neck, too. [7] X Research source For a variety of vibrant face paint colors, consider using the Mehron Makeup Paradise palette. This palette includes 30 colors that mix with water and dry to a smooth finish. To set the makeup and ensure it lasts, apply a makeup sealer spray afterward."

      "title": "Draw red circles on your cheeks.",
      "content": "Draw red circles on your cheeks. Grab some red face paint and draw a 3 in (7.6 cm) wide circle on the very top of your cheeks. Fill the circle in completely for an exaggerated blushing look that most clowns have. Then, repeat on the other side. [8] X Research source If you're aiming for a specific clown aesthetic, such as a Harlequin or a movie-inspired look, research the character's design elements to guide your face paint choices. For example, you might borrow ideas from classic characters like Pennywise or other vintage clown styles. If you don’t have red face paint, use red lipstick instead."

      "title": "Add oversized lips with red lipstick.",
      "content": "Add oversized lips with red lipstick. Grab a tube of red lipstick and put it all over your lips. Then, draw an outline of your lips about 2 inches (5.1 cm) around your entire mouth, then fill that in with the lipstick as well. [9] X Research source Try to find a firetruck red lipstick color so it stands out against your white face paint. If you’re going for an evil clown look, pick black lipstick instead."

      "title": "Draw black semi-circles over your eyes.",
      "content": "Draw black semi-circles over your eyes. Take a black eyeliner pencil and draw a semi-circle outline up and around each of your eyes. Stop the circles in the middle of your forehead to create large, exaggerated eyes for your clown face. [10] X Research source If you don’t have a black eyeliner pencil, you can use any dark color of face paint that you have, like blue, purple, or green. For a creepy clown look, draw 2 black vertical lines starting from the middle of your forehead and down over each eye. End the black line just above your cheeks for a creepy, doll-like look."

      "title": "Fill in the semi-circles with blue eyeshadow.",
      "content": "Fill in the semi-circles with blue eyeshadow. Grab an eyeshadow pallet and a large makeup brush to start filling in your clown eyes.
