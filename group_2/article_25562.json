      "title": "Touch is how a Taurus communicates love.",
      "content": "Touch is how a Taurus communicates love. Although Taurus is not the most sexual sign of the Zodiac, a Taurus man thinks of sensuality and physical touch as one of the most important parts of a relationship If you notice that a Taurus man seems less interested in touching you, this is a sign that he isn’t so invested in the relationship. It’s always a good idea to communicate your needs in a relationship. Try to be upfront and tell your Taurus man something like, “I feel more secure in our relationship when you give me hugs.” If your Taurus reacts negatively to you expressing your needs, don’t feel ashamed. You have the right to feel cared for."

      "title": "Taurus men can be very romantic when they’re interested in someone.",
      "content": "Taurus men can be very romantic when they’re interested in someone. Looking at the place of Taurus in the zodiac, this should come as no surprise—Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and sensuality. If he used to send “good morning” texts, treat you to candlelit dinners, and take you out on special date nights, but stopped putting in effort over time, he might be checked out of the relationship. Not being as romantic as he used to be could simply mean that he’s under a lot of stress. Try not to immediately jump to the conclusion that he’s over you."

      "title": "A Taurus in love enjoys receiving romantic gestures too.",
      "content": "A Taurus in love enjoys receiving romantic gestures too. The key to a Taurus’ heart is through tasteful and practical demonstrations of care, like cooking him a nice meal or getting him a gift that you know they’d enjoy. If he doesn’t seem enthusiastic about these gestures, he could be in your relationship with one foot out the door. Do your best to put together nice experiences for your Taurus, but don’t blame yourself if he doesn’t treat your love with the gratitude it deserves. Your self-worth is important."

      "title": "Beauty is important to a Taurus, and they put effort into their looks.",
      "content": "Beauty is important to a Taurus, and they put effort into their looks. Signs ruled by Venus are very image-conscious and drawn toward aesthetic beauty. A Taurus man wants a beautiful partner and to be seen as handsome himself. If your Taurus seems to not care about what he looks like when he’s with you, he could be distancing himself. Although Taurus men tend to get to this point later than other signs, most people do start to put a bit less effort into their appearance as a relationship progresses. If you’ve expressed to a Taurus man that you want him to clean up his look and he ignores you, this could be a sign that things aren’t going so well."

      "title": "A Taurus man that’s cut back on words of affection may be losing interest.",
      "content": "A Taurus man that’s cut back on words of affection may be losing interest. Taurus men are more likely to express themselves through action, rather than with words—this sign isn’t known for being big on talking about their feelings. But if your Taurus used to always say “I love you” and isn’t anymore, it could mean that he’s checked out of the relationship. Try to use more words of affection with your Taurus and see if he reciprocates. Taurus men often wait for someone else to take the first step, so tell him something like, “You mean the world to me.” [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Taurus men often express their love through money.",
      "content": "Taurus men often express their love through money. Money is extremely important this sign, and they’re nearly always thinking about it. If a Taurus man used to spend money on you without a second thought, but now seems more reluctant, it’s likely that he isn’t treating you like a priority. It’s also possible that your Taurus might just be running into money issues that are stressing him out. Talking about finances is important in any relationship, and if you feel your relationship is at a level where you can do so, ask him a question like, “Have you been stressed about money recently?”"

      "title": "Taurus men have a small social circle, and you should be part of it.",
      "content": "Taurus men have a small social circle, and you should be part of it. It’s hard to break into a Taurus’ group of close connections, but if a Taurus genuinely wants a connection with you, he’ll invite you to be a part of it. Making time to physically be with you and others that he cares about is an important demonstration that he’s still invested in you. If you feel shut out of a Taurus man’s life, try asking him to introduce you to his friends. His reaction can tell you a lot about what he thinks of you."

      "content": "A Taurus normally respects their own time and that of others. As an Earth sign, Taurus men are practical people who enjoy structure in their lives. They wouldn’t tolerate you canceling on them too often, and neither should you. If a Taurus man is constantly blowing off your plans, he likely isn’t giving you the respect you deserve. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that he may have a legitimate excuse for canceling on you. Even so, you should still feel free to express your disappointment. For instance, you might say something like, “I feel like my time isn’t really being respected. Is something going on with you?”"

      "title": "A Taurus man’s inability to forgive can sink any relationship.",
      "content": "A Taurus man’s inability to forgive can sink any relationship. Taurus men are known to be pretty unforgiving—if they’re upset about something, they can hold a grudge for a long time. We all make mistakes, but if a Taurus is constantly holding yours against you, he isn’t treating you with the kindness that you should expect and he is okay with hurting the relationship. If you’ve done something wrong, offer him a sincere apology. After you’ve done this, you’ve done your part—the ball is in his court."

      "title": "Bulls are stubborn, but they still know compromise is important.",
      "content": "Bulls are stubborn, but they still know compromise is important. Taurus men have a reputation for not budging when they’ve made up their minds, but a Taurus who is invested in a relationship will want to make you happy by meeting you halfway. If he isn’t willing to have productive conversations with you when you have a difference of opinion, rethink how much he values your relationship. Many relationships have arguments, but having them too frequently can be a sign that something is wrong. If you’re having a hard time navigating conversations with a Taurus man, consider seeing a couple’s counselor.

      "title": "If a Taurus doesn’t want to work on the relationship, it’s best to move on.",
      "content": "If a Taurus doesn’t want to work on the relationship, it’s best to move on. Unfortunately, some Taurus men can be lazy in relationships—if it’s not easy, they don’t want to do the work to make things better. If you’ve addressed the issues in your relationship with a Taurus man and he hasn’t tried to make things work, it’s not just true that he’s done with you. You deserve to be done with him. Moving on from a relationship is tough, but you have the strength to get through it. Find support from your family and friends, and consider talking to a therapist if you need help."
