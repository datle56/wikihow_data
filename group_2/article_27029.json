      "content": "Place 4 sand, 4 gravel, and 1 dye into the crafting table. Because the recipe for concrete powder is shapeless, you can arrange the recipe in any order on the crafting table. This creates 8 units of concrete powder, which is enough to produce 8 blocks of concrete. [2] X Research source If you don't know where to get these ingredients, read on!"

      "content": "Get 4 blocks of sand. The recipe to create concrete powder (which you'll need to make concrete) calls for 4 units of sand. Dig up some sand with a shovel, mine it , and then pick it up to add it to your inventory. [3] X Research source The best place to find a lot of sand is the desert, but you can also find sand near bodies of water."

      "content": "Mine 4 blocks of gravel. You'll need 4 gravel blocks to produce 8 units of concrete powder, so grab your shovel and start digging. You can also use your hands to dig gravel, but shovels are far more effective. [4] X Research source The best place to get plenty of gravel is in an extreme hills M biome, which boasts entire mountains made of gravel. [5] X Research source You can also mine lots of gravel in the Nether between y-levels 63 and 65, and at the bottom of any ocean biome."

      "content": "Obtain 1 dye in any color. Adding dye to your concrete powder makes it possible to craft vibrantly colored concrete. You can get dye from a wandering trader or craft your own dye from flowers or plants. [6] X Research source For example, if you want to make black concrete, you'll need to make black dye. The recipe for black dye is just 2 ink sacs, which you can get by going underwater and killing squids. If you want white concrete, just add 1 lily of the valley and 1 bone meal to your crafting grid to create white dye."

      "content": "Find some water. Concrete powder requires water to morph into concrete, but not just any type of water. Any flowing water, water source block, or waterlogged block will do. [7] X Research source You won't be able to use rain or splash water bottles to turn concrete powder to concrete."

      "content": "Place the powder block into the body of water. You'll hear the placement sound of concrete as the water absorbs into the powder to produce a concrete block. [8] X Research source You can also place the block of concrete powder down on a dry surface, grab a bucket of water , and pour the water over the concrete powder to form a concrete block immediately."
