      "content": "Use perfume. Yes, using perfume too close to your vagina is a bad idea. However, putting a dab of perfume on the inside of each of your thighs, roughly six inches from the vulva area, is a time-honored way to smell amazing when anyone puts their head down there. Your partner will associate musky smells with sex (since this is the type of smell you have naturally) so try to get a generally musky perfume. Sandalwood and vanilla are common “sexy” smells."

Certain foods tend to affect your body in certain ways, by altering your body’s balance of sugar, bacteria, and chemical compounds. Much like how if you eat a lot of garlic, your skin excretes a garlic smell for several days, you can eat or not eat certain foods to produce a better smell and taste in your vagina. Aim to include some quality sources of protein and fat, as well as a healthy mix of fruits and vegetables. [7] X Research source You’ll want to start by eating less sugar. A spike in blood sugar can cause yeast infections and buildup, which will cause bad odor. [8] X Research source Avoid eating processed foods or simple carbs, such as pastries, cookies, and table sugar. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try to drink at least 12 glasses of water a day, and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Plain yogurt is considered to be a great way to help people keep a healthy vagina, as it contains the bacteria which naturally occurs in our body to maintain a healthy vagina. [10] X Research source"

You will need to monitor your body for other signs of illness and if you really feel that your vaginal odor is unnatural, see your doctor. [11] X Research source One thing to look out for is unusual discharge from your vagina. Brown, green, or chunky white discharges are signs of infection and you should go see your doctor as soon as possible. Just remember that some discharge is normal and healthy but it should not smell.

Any introduction of foreign bacteria can upset the delicate balance in your vagina and so sexual practices can have an effect. Certain practices, in particular, can set off a reaction, namely anal sex before vaginal sex, oral sex, and the use of objects or food as penetrative methods. If you wish to engage in these practices, use protection (like a condom or a dental dam) and change it in between activities."

Tampons that have been forgotten or left in for too long, pieces of a broken condom, or objects used in sexual play are examples of such causes for odor.
