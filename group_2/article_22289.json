Press down on the scar tissue with your fingers as hard as you can without causing any pain. Rub the scar in circular motions for a few minutes at a time to reduce the size of the tissue. You can massage your scars as many times throughout the day as you want. [1] X Research source Fresh scar tissue may still feel tender, so don’t apply too much pressure during your massage. Apply a fingertip-sized amount of petroleum jelly before you start massaging the scar so it’s easier to massage."

      "content": "Cover the scars with a silicone gel sheet to keep them hydrated. As soon as your scabies wounds close up and heal, find silicone sheets that are large enough to cover most of your scars. Peel the adhesive backing off of the sheet and press it firmly against your skin. Leave the silicone sheet on throughout the day and take it off before you bathe. Use a new silicone sheet every day for 6–12 months so the scars aren’t as noticeable.
