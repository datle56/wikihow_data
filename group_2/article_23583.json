      "title": "Follow a healthy diet",
      "content": "Follow a healthy diet to get more sperm-protecting nutrients. The foods you eat can have a positive or negative effect on your fertility, so it’s important to follow a healthy diet. Avoid processed food as much as possible, such as fried foods, fast foods, and frozen or canned processed foods, including processed meat. Instead, eat more whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products. [2] X Research source Replace unhealthy foods by adding more fish to your diet. Try to eliminate trans fats from your diet. Avoiding fried foods and junk food will help. Avoid soy products. Limit your consumption of high-fat dairy, such as whole milk and ice cream. Eat more walnuts if you aren't allergic to nuts."

Vitamin C has been shown to promote the overall quality of sperm, including sperm morphology, so make sure that you eat plenty of vitamin C-rich foods every day. [3] X Research source Males 19 and older need 90 mg of vitamin C daily, and they should not exceed 2,000 mg per day. Some good sources of vitamin C include: [4] X Research source Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes Peppers Cantaloupe Mangoes Broccoli Cauliflower Sweet potatoes"

      "content": "Use olive oil instead of other types of fat. One study showed that soybean oil had a negative effect on sperm morphology, but when it was replaced with olive oil, sperm morphology improved. If you tend to use products that contain soybean oil, try switching to products that contain olive oil or use olive oil for cooking and flavoring foods. [10] X Research source For example, you could replace a soybean oil-based margarine with olive oil or an olive oil-based spread for baking. Try drizzling olive oil on salads instead of using a salad dressing that is made from soybean oil. Steer clear of any processed foods that feature soybean oil on the ingredients list."

      "content": "Include a daily multivitamin as nutritional insurance. Taking a daily multivitamin has not been shown to provide a significant improvement to sperm morphology, but it may help you to meet your overall nutritional needs. This may benefit your sperm in the long run by preventing any nutritional deficiencies. [11] X Research source Look for a multivitamin that contains no more than 100% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals. You might also consider taking a daily multivitamin formulated for men."

Smoking may increase the incidence of male-factor infertility, by lowering sperm counts, reducing motility, and increasing the number of abnormally-shaped sperm. By quitting smoking, you may be able to drastically improve the quality of your sperm. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about your options for quitting. You may be a good candidate for a smoking cessation aid and your doctor can recommend other resources for quitting.
