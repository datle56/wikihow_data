      "content": "Sit next to him in class. Even if your teacher doesn’t allow much chatter, your odds of talking to him are better if you're next to him. You'll be able to interact with him more often than if you were on opposite sides of the room. For example, you may need to borrow a pencil, or pass handouts to each other. [1] X Research source If you don't have class with him, or if your teacher doesn’t let you pick your seats, sit near him in the cafeteria or hang out with him during breaks. Say \"hi\" to him in the halls! The more he is around you, the more likely he is to eventually develop feelings. You'll also be able to use body language to attract him, which will be explained later."

      "content": "Figure out what to say. It can be scary to talk to someone you have a crush on, but it will definitely get his attention. Having an idea of what to say ahead of time may help, though. Rather than planning out word for word what to say, just have a general idea. For example, you can plan to ask about certain topics, like a question about the homework assignment or make a comment about an upcoming project. Make sure you don’t sound too rehearsed. The more natural and casual you seem, the better. This can be avoided by not planning a script. Keep it casual. Rather than saying, “Hello. I remember you enjoy [TV show]. Did you watch the episode last night?\" try “Oh hey, you watch [TV show] right? Did you catch last night’s episode?”"

      "content": "Start a conversation. This will show him that you’re friendly and want to get to know him better. Use something around you for inspiration, like the crazy weather, the boring homework assignment, or the new movie that's coming out. A question would be even better, because this will help the conversation move along. Ask something that doesn't require a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. For example, you could ask: \"How do you feel about the project?\" or \"What do you plan on doing for the project.\" Try not to feel too nervous or worry too much about what he thinks. It'll make the chat go more smoothly."

      "content": "Find common interests. If you know you cheer for the same sports team or watch the same weekly television shows, bring that up in conversation. If you saw he ate your favorite flavor of chips for lunch, say something. It doesn’t matter what it is — common interests or hobbies are great ways to start conversations that can lead to other things. If he sees similarities in you, he will be more likely to like you! [2] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Relationship Expert Expert Interview. 27 November 2019. If you don’t have any common interests, make some. For example, if he wore a band t-shirt to school, listen to their music and mention it in conversation. At the same time, don't fake it. If you don't like the band, don't pretend you do. Consider looking up another band for the same genre, or even asking him for recommendations!"

Watch his body language, and mimic it. If he leans towards you, lean into him. If he leans up against a locker, lean up against a locker. If he runs a hand through his hair, wait a few seconds, then do the same. It’s really simple, and it’s really effective. Be sure to allow a 3 to 4-second delay before mirroring his action. You don't want to literally mime him—that will look more strange than endearing."

      "content": "Invite him to things. It doesn’t have to be any sort of romantic invitation. You can ask him to see a movie with a whole group of people, or work on some homework together. You can even ask if he just wants to meet up at a school sporting event or another local event in town. It doesn’t matter what the invitation is — what matters is that you’re showing interest and getting to spend time with him outside of school. [6] X Research source Don't worry if he rejects your invitation once. He could be shy or just busy. If he rejects 2 or more invitations, however, consider moving on."

By joining his social circle, you’ll increase your odds of seeing him at social events outside of school. Of course, this doesn’t mean to ditch your current friends or use his friends to get to this boy. Dont try to hard, take it chill and try to be friends first. For example: Sit next to his friends in class and start a conversation. Don't be pushy or fake about it, however. Compliment his female friends. If you like their backpack or outfit, mention it! Don't let jealousy get in the way and did them. Go out of your way to make his friends see you as a friendly, warm person..

Let your friendship grow a little bit before revealing your crush, just so he doesn’t feel overwhelmed or totally caught off guard. Not only will he be impressed that you had the confidence to tell him your feelings outright, he will also be flattered. Who wouldn’t? [7] X Research source Some signs that he might be into you include: initiating physical closeness, laughing at jokes or having inside jokes with you, gently teasing you, blushing around you, making an effort to be around you, and asking you questions about yourself. You don’t need to make this a serious, sit-down chat in which you pour out your heart. All you need to do is tell him what you think about him, or what makes you like being around him. Keep it casual. Do this when you’re able to talk to him alone. It’s okay if you’re with a group of people, just try to find a time to break apart and talk to him one-on-one. Say something like, “I have so much fun hanging out with you. I think you’re really funny and smart, and I like you as more than a friend.”"

[8] X Research source He may be shy, so respect that he might not be comfortable answering you. Don't pressure him or demand a certain answer. While a rejection might hurt at first, it'll save you time and hurt feelings in the future.
