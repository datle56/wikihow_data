      "content": "Remove the leaf springs from the rear suspension of the vehicle. Take them to a spring shop and have them de-arched, or use a reverse shackle. Another option is reversing the set up by placing the axle on top of the leaf spring, which is called a flip kit. This can be done by a home mechanic with common hand tools. To get even greater or increased drop, couple the flip kit with lowering blocks. These are available online or from your local auto parts store. They come in differing heights and will enable the vehicle to drop extremely low. They can be installed by a home mechanic. Depending on how low you go, you may have to install a C-notch above your real axle. The purpose of the notch is to give you a greater clearance between your frame and axle."

You can remove the stock coil springs and replace them with shorter springs, or take your springs to a spring shop and have the coils softened and shortened. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "You can also cut the coils yourself. [2] X Research source Use a grinder, cutting wheel, or torch to cut them. Start with cutting in quarter- or half-coil-turn increments, because cutting a coil is a permanent action. You may have to install shorter bump stops or cut your stock ones to fit."

In addition to installing the airbags to replace the springs, this method of lowering your car also requires installation of air lines, an air compressor, air reservoir tank and system activation switch.

One drawback to this method of lowering your vehicle is the large amount of battery power required to operate each hydraulic pump in the system."

      "content": "Adjust your car's torsion bars down using the torsion bar key. This will sag your vehicle so it is lower to the ground. Torsion bars come factory equipped on vehicles and consists of a spring steel bar that's used in place of a coil or leaf spring. The torsion bar key is part of the torsion bar, which allows the vehicle ride height to be adjusted at the factory when the vehicle is built and as needed afterward. It's easily adjusted with a small hand wrench at home."
