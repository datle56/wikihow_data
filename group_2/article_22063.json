      "content": "Handle your hair gently when you wash and dry it. The way you handle your hair makes a big difference in its texture and appearance. When you're rough with your hair, it can frizz up and start looking dull. [1] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Hair is a fragile material that should be handled with care, just like a delicate piece of fabric. Here's what to keep in mind: When you shampoo your hair don't roughly scrub it. Massage the shampoo into your hair and distribute it with your fingers. Rinse your conditioner in the coldest water you can stand. The cold temperature seals the cuticle and helps your hair look shiny, while hot water will cause it to frizz up and look dull. Gently squeeze the water from your hair and pat it dry with a towel instead of twisting and wringing it out.

[3] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. The natural oil your scalp produces to nourish your hair gets rinsed away before it can do its job. If you want your hair to stay healthy and shiny, you only really need to wash it once or twice a week, depending on your hair type. [4] X Research source When you first cut back on how often you wash your hair, you may notice it looking oilier than normal. Your scalp is producing oil on overdrive since it's used to everyday washings. After a week or two things will balance out and your hair will look cleaner, longer. On days in between washings, when you need to perk up your hair, try dry shampoo . It's a powder you sprinkle, or an aerosol you spray, on your hair to absorb the oil, and it works like a charm."

      "content": "Let your hair air dry instead of using heat. The best way to keep your hair healthy is to let it dry naturally instead of using a hair dryer. The heat from the hair dryer damages the hair shaft, and if you do it every day you'll definitely see damage over time. [5] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Put that hair dryer away and let your hair dry the natural way. The same goes for other heat styling tools, like curling irons, straightening irons, and hot rollers. On days when you do want to use a hair dryer or other styling tools, apply a heat protectant serum to your hair so it doesn't get quite as damaged."

      "content": "Comb your hair instead of brushing it. Running a plastic-bristled brush through your hair, especially when it's wet, is almost guaranteed to cause some damage. Brushing tends to rip your hair, while combing removes the tangles without pulling it out. Use a wide-tooth comb and work out the tangles starting close to the tips and moving up to the roots."

      "content": "Don't use damaging treatments. Dyeing, bleaching, chemically straightening, and chemically curling your hair all damage the shaft. For the healthiest possible hair, it's best to stop these treatments and let your hair take on its natural color and texture. Your hair might not be the exact color you want, but it will be healthy, shiny and silky. If you do want to dye your hair, look into henna, honey, or tea dyeing. These natural dyes actually restore shine to your hair, rather than damaging it. You won't be able to achieve a dramatic color change, but you can go a few shades lighter or darker."

      "content": "Avoid restrictive hairstyles that pull out hair. Waves, wefts, dreads, and other styles that require permanently pulling your hair into a tight position can cause damage and hair loss. While some types of weaves are less damaging than others (sewn weaves are usually better than glue-ins, for example) your hair will be healthier if you forego them altogether."

      "title": "Condition your hair each time you shampoo.",
      "content": "Condition your hair each time you shampoo. Use just enough conditioner to coat the strands of your hair without completely weighing it down. Apply the conditioner an inch or so from your roots and use a wide-toothed comb to comb it down to the tips. Rinse the conditioner with cool water for a shiny finish. If your hair tends to get very dry, try using a leave-in conditioner as well. Apply the conditioner after you get out of the shower, while your hair is still damp. It will keep your hair soft and supple until your next shampoo."

      "content": "Do deep conditioning treatments every few weeks. Deep conditioning treatments are a great way to make your hair look silkier and shinier. Since the treatments are so effective, you only need to do them once every week or two. Use a store-bought deep conditioner or a household oil like coconut oil, olive oil, or almond oil. Complete the treatment as follows: Dampen your hair and apply about a tablespoon of the deep conditioner. Use a wide-toothed comb to distribute it throughout your hair. Put your hair in a high bun or ponytail at the top of your head. Cover with a shower cap or plastic wrap. Leave the conditioner in for at least an hour and up to eight hours. Shampoo your hair as normal to remove excess conditioner."

The bristles are the same texture as human hair, and they pull your hair's natural oil from the roots to the tips for a nourishing conditioning treatment. These brushes also stimulate the scalp, which promotes hair growth. The night or morning before you plan to shampoo your hair, use a wide-tooth comb to remove tangles. Brush your hair with a boar bristle brush for about 10 minutes to distribute the oils. Wait at least an hour before shampooing."

      "content": "Be healthy from the inside out. Your diet and other health habits have a big effect on the texture of your hair. When you eat plenty of protein, nutrients, and healthy fats, your hair looks shiny and healthy. When you don't, your hair is the first place it shows. Watch and see how your hair improves when you do the following: Eat food that contains protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and iron. Salmon, sardines, avocados, nuts, and flaxseeds are all excellent for promoting healthy hair growth. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. When you're dehydrated, your hair can end up getting dry and brittle. Avoid smoking cigarettes. Smoke damage can make hair look dull and dried out."

      "content": "Use natural hair products. Ingredients in your shampoo and conditioner may be making your hair look dry and dull instead of silky and shiny. Switch to all-natural shampoos and conditioners that nourish your hair instead of stripping its gleam and weighing it down. Here's what to use: [8] X Research source Choose sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates are harsh cleansers used in everything from dish soap to laundry detergent, and people are starting to realize they're not very good for hair. Look for shampoos that say \"sulfate-free\" and are made with natural cleansers. Sulfate-free shampoos are also good for those with curly and wavy hair, because they help prevent frizz. Choose a silicone-free conditioner. Silicons are added to conditioner because they make hair look shiny and smooth after the first few applications. Unfortunately, over time they build up in your hair and cause it to look weighed-down and dull. You're better off with silicone-free options."

      "content": "Massage your scalp to promote hair growth. Besides feeling great, massage promotes good circulation in the scalp, which helps your hair grow faster and stronger. Do a scalp massage every day, or at least every time you take a shower. Just place your fingers on your scalp and rub it using a gentle circular motion. To enhance your massage, try using coconut oil, almond oil, or jojoba oil. This is especially beneficial if you're worried about thinning hair. Tea tree oil, lavender oil or cedar wood oil are also healthy for hair."
