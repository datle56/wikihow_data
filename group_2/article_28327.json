      "content": "Groom your cat to improve the look of its coat. Regular brushing will remove loose hairs, dirt, and external parasites. It will also help spread natural oils produced by your cat’s skin throughout its fur. This will increase the overall shininess and sleekness of your cat’s coat. Brushing your cat frequently will also reduce the amount of fur that it swallows when grooming itself, thus reducing the number of hairballs it produces. Begin grooming your cat at a young age so that it will get accustomed to it. Professional cat-grooming services may also be available in your area. Prices for these services can vary widely."

      "content": "Decide how often your cat needs brushing. Long-haired varieties of cats will need more frequent brushing than short-haired varieties. Long-haired cats will need to be brushed once every few days, while short-haired cats may only need grooming once a week. Other experts suggest brushing long-haired cats for at least 15 minutes per day."

      "content": "Gather the supplies you will need. To brush your cat well, you will need a quality general brush, a steel comb, and a rubber or bristle brush. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source All of these should be versions designed specifically for cats. Optionally, a fine chamois or washcloth can be used to wipe your cat after brushing. This will remove any remaining hairs and improve the shine of your cat’s coat."

[2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Next, use the steel comb the same way. This will help remove any dirt and debris. Finally, use a bristle or rubber brush, which will remove any loose hairs. If your cat’s fur has any tangles, carefully work those out before brushing its whole coat. If you wish, wipe your cat with a chamois or washcloth after brushing to maximize the shine of its coat. Make sure to be gentle on your cat’s sensitive areas, such as its belly. To brush the tail of a long-haired cat, make a part down the middle and brush fur to either side."

      "content": "Decide when to bathe your cat. Cats are known to be self-grooming, and will only rarely need a bath. However, if your cat can’t or won’t groom itself well, you may need to bathe it more frequently. How often to bathe your cat will depend on its breed and activity level. Long-haired or especially active cats, for instance, might need to be bathed more frequently. A cat that is arthritic and has difficulty grooming itself, however, might also need to be bathed more frequently."

      "content": "Prepare your cat for its bath. You may want to place cotton balls in your cat’s ears to keep water out of them. Choose a bath time when your cat is calm. Playing with your cat before giving it a bath might help to calm and tire it a bit so that the bath is less stressful. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Try to soothe your cat before the bath, by giving it a small treat, talking softly to it, or petting it.

Before you let your cat out of the bath, make sure to thoroughly rinse its fur free all traces of shampoo or conditioner, so that your cat does not accidentally swallow any. Otherwise, your kitty might wind up with an upset tummy or other problems."

Hair dryers may not be a good choice for use on cats as they can dry out your cat's skin, or even cause them to have heat stroke; in addition, the noise may bother some cats. If you wish to use a hair dryer, make sure it is on the lowest (or “cool”) heat setting.
