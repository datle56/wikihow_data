      "content": "Check for 9 in (23 cm), 12 in (30 cm), or 18 in (46 cm) square tiles. The most popular size and shape of asbestos tiles when they were used as a popular building material were 9 in (23 cm) by 9 in (23 cm) squares. But 12 in (30 cm) and 18 in (46 cm) squares were commonly used as well. [2] X Research source Contact an asbestos professional to inspect your tile to see if it contains asbestos. You may be able to test the tile yourself with a test kit that you can order online. The asbestos-containing tiles could be thick, stone-like tiles or they could be thin, vinyl tiles."

      "title": "Find out if any of the tiles were installed before 1980.",
      "content": "Find out if any of the tiles were installed before 1980. Asbestos tiles can be difficult to identify because you can’t see the asbestos in the tile. Because asbestos was widely used before 1980, if you have flooring tiles that were installed before then, you need to test a piece of the flooring to make sure it’s safe. You can test the tile yourself or hire an asbestos professional to inspect and test the tiles for asbestos. Knowing when your building was built can help you find out when the tiles were installed. Access your building information by searching through public records to find out when it was constructed."

      "title": "See if your tiles appear stained or oily.",
      "content": "See if your tiles appear stained or oily. Asbestos tiles contain asphalt as a main ingredient. Asphalt can degrade over time and cause the tiles to appear grimy or have spots of discoloration. [3] X Research source Try cleaning the tile with soap and water and if the discoloration or oil doesn’t seem to come off, it may be because it’s a tile that contains asphalt and asbestos."

      "title": "Inspect the tiles for cracks and damage.",
      "content": "Inspect the tiles for cracks and damage. Asbestos is only harmful if it’s ingested or inhaled. In order for asbestos to be released into the air, tile that contains asbestos must be damaged or degrading. Check your tile to see if there are cracks or spots where the material seems to be breaking down. [4] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Be especially concerned if you’re not sure how old the tiles are or if you believe they were installed before 1980."

      "title": "Look for residue of old flooring tiles that may have contained asbestos.",
      "content": "Look for residue of old flooring tiles that may have contained asbestos. Many old flooring tiles that contained asbestos were designed and arranged in a 9 in (23 cm) by 9 in (23 cm) pattern. If you’re renovating a building or redoing the flooring in a room, look for the pattern of older tiles that could indicate that asbestos tiles were present. [5] X Research source Even if the tiles were removed or don’t contain asbestos, the adhesive on the backing could contain it. If you do find old flooring tiles that you think may contain asbestos, stop working immediately and contact an asbestos professional."

Check the packaging to find out how you need to provide the sample and where you need to send it once you’ve taken a sample. Follow all instructions carefully. [7] X Research source If you’re in the US, make sure you purchase a test kit that uses lab methods that are approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Check the packaging to make sure. Asbestos test kits cost around $10. While you may be allowed to do it yourself, it is recommended to contact an accredited asbestos inspector to gather samples to avoid contamination."

Asbestos dust can still harm someone, even in small amounts. Lay down a plastic sheet or a tarp to catch any dust that could escape.

Wear a respirator approved for handling asbestos, rubber gloves, long-sleeved clothing, and rubber boots with shoe covers when you plan to take a sample of tile that could potentially contain asbestos. Use equipment that you don’t mind throwing away because you’ll need to discard the items after you wear them and collect a sample. [9] X Research source"
