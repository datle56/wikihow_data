      "content": "Look for grass seedlings in about 5–30 days. As long as you maintain proper growing conditions, your grass seed will sprout within the first month of planting it. While some species of grass will germinate within the first week, others take longer to establish. Common choices for turfgrass and their germination times are: [1] X Research source Kentucky bluegrass: 14–30 days Perennial ryegrass: 5–10 days Tall fescue: 7–12 days Bermudagrass: 10–30 days Buffalograss: 14–30 days Bentgrass: 10–14 days Centipede grass: 21–28 days [2] X Research source Zoysia grass: 14–21 days [3] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source"

      "content": "Plant cool-season grass in the fall. Cool-season grasses are sensitive to hot summer temperatures and are better at handling moderate fall conditions. Since weed seeds are less likely to germinate in the fall, sowing grass seeds in the fall gives them a better chance at establishing healthy roots without any competition. Common cool-season grasses include: [4] X Research source Kentucky bluegrass Tall fescue Perennial ryegrass Bentgrass"

      "content": "Seed warm-season grasses in the late spring or early summer. Warm-season grasses thrive during the warmer summer months, but go dormant in the fall and winter. To give your new lawn some time to establish, plant your seeds at the end of the fall after the last frost in your area. The most common warm-season grasses are: [5] X Research source Bermudagrass Zoysia grass Centipede grass Buffalograss"

      "content": "Get rid of weeds growing in your lawn. Before you plant your grass seed, apply a pre-emergent herbicide that’s labeled for newly seeded lawns to prevent weeds from growing in. If you see weeds sprouting up in the soil while your grass is germinating, then pull them by hand to remove the roots. [6] X Research source Weeds compete for nutrients in the soil and may prevent your grass from growing in. Avoid using a broadleaf herbicide when you’re growing grass seed since it also affects the new growths. Pull broadleaf weeds by hand so you can get rid of them without killing your grass ."

      "content": "Amend your soil with compost. Till your soil to a depth of 4–6 inches (10–15 cm), and then apply a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 centimetres) layer of compost on top. Rake the compost to mix it in with the soil. [7] X Research source Adding compost helps loosen up tightly-packed soil and helps it retain moisture to help your grass seeds grow."

      "content": "Fertilize your grass seed to provide nutrients. Run a soil test to check the pH and nutrient levels in your soil to see what your lawn needs. Apply a seed starter fertilizer to the soil right before you plant your grass seeds to help them germinate faster. Use either a granular or liquid fertilizer, following the package instructions based on the nutrient levels of your soil. [8] X Research source About 4 weeks after your grass sprouts, spread a slow-release, high-nitrogen mix over your lawn so your new grass gets more nutrients as it establishes. After your lawn is established, apply fertilizer in the spring and fall each year. Most grasses thrive when soil has a pH between 5.8 and 6.5. [9] X Research source"

Afterward, pull a lawn roller over the soil to lightly compact the soil so it makes good contact with the seeds.

      "content": "Apply straw mulch over your grass seed. Pick a clean wheat, oat, or barley straw since they’re less likely to contain weed seeds. Spread the mulch in a thin layer so you can still see the soil surface through it. [11] X Research source Mulch helps the soil retain moisture and prevents weeds from growing. If you planted seeds in the fall, leave the mulch on through the winter to keep your grass from dying."

      "content": "Water the top 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) of soil regularly to keep it moist. Stick your finger into the soil to see if it feels moist. If the soil feels dry or crumbles easily between your fingers, use a sprinkler or watering can to lightly water it. You may need to water them 2–3 times a day before they sprout depending on how fast your soil dries out. As your grass grows in and establishes, only water about once a week to a depth of 6–8 inches (15–20 cm). [12] X Research source Reduce how often you water when it’s rainy, cool, or overcast since the soil will stay moist for longer."

Wait until your grass is about ⅓ taller than the height you want to maintain before you mow. Then, only remove a third of the foliage so you don’t stress your new grass. [13] X Research source"
