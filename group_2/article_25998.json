      "title": "Candles",
      "content": "Candles While using candles is the traditional way to light a Halloween pumpkin, it’s a bit more dangerous than battery-powered lights because they could get blown out by the wind or start a fire. Stick to tea lights or votive candles that have small flames so they’re less of a fire risk. Set the candles inside of the pumpkin first and use a long-necked utility lighter to reach inside. Make sure your pumpkin has a flat sturdy base and avoid placing it anywhere it could easily be kicked or knocked over. [1] X Research source If you use a candle, monitor your pumpkin the entire time it’s lit to make sure the flame doesn’t spread. If you have to leave, blow out the candle."

If you have a larger pumpkin, a single light may not be enough to light up the entire design. Feel free to experiment with a few different combinations of lights to see what you like best. Alternatively, line the inside of your jack-o’-lantern with aluminum foil except for the carved areas. The light will reflect off the metal and make your design pop more."

Originally, people carved faces into turnips or beets and displayed them in their windows. When people came to America, people began carving pumpkins instead.
