      "content": "Continually messing with your lips will only make them worse. Additionally, if you're picking at your lips with dirty fingers you run the risk of introducing bacteria, which can cause an infection. The saliva you introduce to your lips when you lick them can excessively dry out your lips, making it difficult for them to heal. Saliva might also contain bacteria that can infect your lips. As your lips are healing, they might tingle, which can make you want to touch them. Try to resist this urge as much as possible."

      "content": "Balms keep your lips moist so they can heal. Keep your lips constantly moist with a lip balm that includes beeswax or petrolatum as one of its main ingredients. Shea butter or mineral oil also help moisturize and protect your lips. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source These lip balms are typically safe to apply as often as necessary to keep your lips moist. Keep a tube or pot in your pocket or with you at all times so you can apply lip balm whenever your lips start to feel dry. A simple petrolatum-based product like petroleum jelly can help keep your lips moist and promote faster healing. In addition to locking in moisture, there’s evidence that coconut oil can reduce inflammation and soothe pain.
