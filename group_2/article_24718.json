      "content": "Hang CD-roms from strings in the trees. Birds do not like reflective surfaces and will be scared away by the CD-roms, especially when they reflect bright sunlight. Tie string around the CD-roms and attach one per tree branch. Hang them 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) down from the branches. [1] X Research source If you are trying to deter birds from fruit-bearing trees, harvest the fruit and then remove the CD-roms. You can put them back up next year as the trees start to bear fruit to keep birds away . You can also use pie plates instead of CD-roms, as they are also reflective. Poke holes through the pie plates and tie string to them. Then, attach one pie plate per branch. Another option is to hang a piece of mylar tape and let it dangle in the wind."

      "title": "Use shiny, scary looking balloons in the trees.",
      "content": "Use shiny, scary looking balloons in the trees. Get balloons with scary faces that are made of shiny material. Balloons with menacing bird faces are ideal, as they will fool the birds into thinking there are predators in the trees. Tie them onto the tree branches with string. [3] X Research source You will need to move the balloons around the trees once a week so the birds think they are alive."

      "title": "Place a scarecrow at the base of the trees.",
      "content": "Place a scarecrow at the base of the trees. Make a scarecrow out of straw and wood that is half the size of the trees. Dress the scarecrow in a hat or a shirt. The birds will think it is human and stay away. [4] X Research source You will need to change the position of the scarecrow once a week so the birds think it is a real person. You should also change the scarecrowâ€™s appearance by putting a hat on it or an item of clothing."

      "title": "Try a decoy hawk or owl.",
      "content": "Try a decoy hawk or owl. You can buy decoy hawks made out of plastic at your local hardware store or online. Birds are scared of hawks and owls and will assume the decoy is real. [5] X Research source You will need to move the hawk or owl around to a different spot in the trees every few days so the birds think it is alive."

      "title": "Use a moving device.",
      "content": "Use a moving device. A moving device like a spider that wiggles or a hawk that makes screeching noises can scare the birds away. Look for moving devices at your local hardware store or online. Hang them from the trees so they can deter the birds. [6] X Research source Most moving devices run on batteries. You will need to swap out the batteries regularly so the devices keep working. Sometimes moving devices can be annoying to people because they will release high pitched sounds regularly."

      "title": "Get a bird sound deterrent for the trees.",
      "content": "Get a bird sound deterrent for the trees. Look for a bird sound deterrent at your local hardware store or online. These devices send out bird distress calls to keep birds away. Hang them in your trees. These deterrents use batteries so you will need to replace them regularly. Most sound deterrents use sound waves that cannot be detected by humans, only by birds. You should not be bothered by these devices."

      "title": "Drape the trees with plastic netting.",
      "content": "Drape the trees with plastic netting. Netting is a great way to deter birds and protect fruit bearing trees. Use bamboo poles, fence posts, or tall stakes to create a frame around the tree. Then, drape the netting over the frame so it reaches the ground. Use wire to anchor the netting to the ground so it does not move. [7] X Research source Netting that has been well anchored will usually stay in place despite wind or rough weather. Keep in mind that barriers like plastic netting may not look the most attractive on your trees, but they will help keep birds away."

      "content": "Use reflective tape. You can also put a layer of reflective tape over the tree branches to keep birds out. Use flash tape that makes a crinkling sound, as the sound will also deter the birds. [9] X Research source Make sure you secure the tape by tying it to a piece of wire in the ground."

      "title": "Cut off overgrown branches.",
      "content": "Cut off overgrown branches. Use a clean pair of garden shears to prune branches that are overgrown or damaged. Remove branches that cross each other or that are growing inward, towards the tree trunk. Cut the branches at a 45 degree angle, pruning them just above the tree trunk. [10] X Research source Removing branches on the tree will give the birds less of a surface area for perching. This can deter them from spending too much time in the trees. It will also encourage the tree to grow well."

      "title": "Trim the trees regularly.",
      "content": "Trim the trees regularly. Prune the trees in late fall or winter so it has time to recover and grow in. Trim the trees so they maintain their shape and do not become overgrown. Only trim 25 percent or less of the tree at one time. Over trimming the tree can actually cause it to become more overgrown and out of control.. [11] X Research source If you have fruit bearing trees, make sure you harvest the fruit once it is ready to be picked so birds stay away."
