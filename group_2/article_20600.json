      "content": "Aquarius men need distance to cope with difficult emotions. Wait to text him and hold off on engaging over social media until he’s had enough time to process the breakup. You will likely have to be the one to re-establish contact, but give it a few weeks at least (and aim for 30 days if you’re unsure). [1] X Research source If he’s going to come back to you, it has to be on his terms and in a comfortable time frame. Don't be surprised if giving an Aquarius man space means no contact at all from him. They often detach entirely from the source of their negative emotions (like a person they have just broken up with). Just because you’re not talking, that doesn’t mean he isn’t thinking about you—or that he won’t be open to getting back together in the future. If you let too much time pass, he’ll move on, but he needs some time to himself before you take the next step in reconnecting with him."

      "content": "An Aquarius man needs to know that you’re okay with being alone. Go out with friends and family, dive back into the hobbies that make you happiest, and post the pictures from your adventures on social media. Aquarius men place a lot of value on freedom and independence, and if your Aquarius man sees that you can be your own person, he’ll be reassured that he can do the same when you’re together. The type of hobby isn’t important, so long as you’re going for it! Whether it’s playing guitar or training for a marathon, making time for your passions will show him that you’re independent and thriving alone. It may seem counter-intuitive to show someone that you don’t need them, but it will reassure an Aquarius man. He doesn’t want to see you at home pining for him; he wants to see you out, about, and loving life.

      "content": "Stay cool and collected when you see an Aquarius man post-breakup. Breaking up probably hurt, regardless of how it happened, but showing too much emotion now will only push an Aquarius man away. Maintain your composure around him and leave the drama in the past. This will keep his mind open to the possibility of getting back together. An Aquarius man doesn’t like to feel pressured by pleading or tearful, dramatic speeches after a relationship and tends to be uncomfortable with people who don’t have control of their emotions. It’s okay to shed a tear or vent about hurt feelings—you’re human, after all. Just make sure you do this in private, either alone or with a friend that you feel comfortable with."

Ask him lots of questions, listen to his thoughts, and offer up your own opinions. You can talk to him about anything from philosophy to politics and humanitarian issues, so long as it gets his mind working. [4] X Research source When you’re just starting to catch up after time apart, you can ask him if he’s read any good books (and tell him about a particularly good novel that you’ve read recently too). Bring up a story on the news that you know would catch his interest, and ask him for his thoughts on it. He’ll want to get back with a partner who can keep up with him intellectually. Keep these conversations centered on intellectual topics rather than overly emotional ones. There will be time to talk about your relationship with him later!"

Keep things simple when you’re just getting restarted. Reach out and ask him if he wants to grab a coffee and catch up.

Before you approach him, think about what you want out of a renewed relationship with him and let him see that you’ve put a lot of thought into it. Aquarians are more rational than emotional, so give him a strong logical reason to get back together. He’ll be more likely to respect your request—and earnestly consider it. Be honest and sincere in your approach. The key is communicating effectively and letting your Aquarius man know where you stand while keeping things casual."

      "content": "Aquarius men need sincere apologies from people who wrong them. If you made a mistake during the relationship, you need to show him that you’re truly sorry and want to change. Aquarius men are sensitive and want to know that you mean what you say. If he sees you making a real effort to make things right, he’s more likely to accept your apology and come back to you. Remember that it might take time for him to come back to you, even after you apologize. Let him have the space he needs—with an apology, he’s more likely to spend that time forgiving than he is to spend it upset. You may not be the only one who made mistakes. If both of you need to make compromises for a new relationship to work, then have a civil discussion with him about it. Keep your arguments logical and clear for the best chance at getting your Aquarius man back."

Try new restaurants, and explore activities that you’ve never done before. He’ll love having someone who can keep him on his toes. If you decide to go out to lunch with him, take him someplace he’s never been as a fun surprise. Come up with spur-of-the-moment plans to catch a movie or check out a new store that you think he might like. Aquarius men love to go on adventures and don’t mind a last-minute change of plans.
