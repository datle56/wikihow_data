      "content": "Reduce the heat to 150 °F (66 °C). Turn down the heat so the cornmeal stays warm but is no longer boiling. Use a thermometer in the cornmeal to ensure it stays at the right temperature. [3] X Research source Cooling down the cornmeal will ensure it interacts properly with the yeast when it is added."

The mixture should become soupy and thin. [4] X Research source Remove the mash from the heat once the sugar and yeast have been mixed in."

      "content": "Put in dried fruit mash if you'd like more flavor. If you'd like to give the mash a more fruity flavor, soak 1-2 bags of dried fruit in 1 to 2 cups (0.24 to 0.47 l) of water. Then, mash the dried fruit up in the water so it becomes more of a juice. Pour the dried fruit mash into the cornmeal mixture and mix it in with a spoon. [5] X Research source Try a fruit mash with bananas, apricots, and pineapple to add flavor. A dried fruit mash with blue berries, cherries, and strawberries can also give the mixture a nice fruity taste."

      "content": "Cover the mash and place it in a cool, dark place. You can leave the mash in the pot and place a lid on it or lay a cloth over it. Put the mash in a basement, cellar, or in the back of a closet so it can ferment. The temperature of 60 °F (16 °C) or lower is ideal. [6] X Research source You can also pour the mash in an empty cooler and put the lid on it so it can ferment."

      "content": "Check the mash for large bubbles on the surface. After 4-5 days, check the mash to see if there are large bubbles that are moving very slowly or sitting on the surface. This is usually a sign the mash is ready to be distilled. [8] X Research source If the mash still has a lot of smaller bubbles on the surface, it may not be ready to distill and need more time to ferment."

      "content": "Distill the mash in a copper still if you have one available. Rent a copper still from your local brewing supply store or buy one. Look for a copper still made for homebrewing, as they will be smaller and more compact. Then, pour the mash in the still and distill it, following the directions attached to the copper still. [9] X Research source You may want to invest in a copper still if you plan to make moonshine mash, and other home alcoholic beverages, often. A 13 gallons (49 l) copper still can range in price from $900-$1,300 USD."

      "content": "Use a pressure cooker and a copper pipe as a makeshift still. Bring the mash to 173 °F (78 °C) in the pressure cooker. Attach a coiled copper pipe to the vent of the pressure cooker with electrical tape. Run the copper coil through a bucket of cold water and put the end in a clean container. As the mash cooks, the vapors from the pressure cooker vent will run through the copper pipe and condense into moonshine. The moonshine will then move through the pipe into the clean container. [10] X Research source This is a homemade approach to a copper still, so you may need to monitor it to ensure it works correctly. Check that the mash stays at a constant temperature so it can condense into moonshine."

      "content": "Filter the mash using cheesecloth and a strainer. Place a large plastic strainer over a large soup pot. Then, drape the cheesecloth over the strainer. Put a smaller strainer over the cheesecloth, holding it over the cheesecloth with your non-dominant hand. Hold a spoon with your dominant hand and scoop the mash into the smaller strainer. Lift the smaller strainer up to remove larger impurities, such as large pieces of cornmeal or fruit. [12] X Research source You can then squeeze the cheesecloth to remove any smaller impurities from the mash. The cheesecloth should get rid of the stuff sitting on the surface of the mash, or the head, so the mash runs clear. Repeat this process until you have strained out all the mash. It should appear clear and clean in the soup pot. Throw away the impurities once you have strained them out of the mash."

      "content": "Store the moonshine mash in airtight glass jars. Make sure the glass jars are sterile and clean. Keep them in a cool, dark place, sealed tight. You can then sip moonshine mash on its own or add it to cocktails and other drinks. Moonshine mash should last for at least 6 months-1 year, if stored properly."
