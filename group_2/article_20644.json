      "content": "Use flirty touches to create sexual tension. Small, flirtatious touches and gestures can help build up the anticipation for a more intimate moment later in the day. For instance, wink at them when you hand them their coffee, brush up against them when you pass each other in the hallway, or teasingly touch them when they’re close by. This is one form of foreplay that can help build up some steamy tension. [1] X Research source Give your partner plenty of compliments—when you're looking for things to appreciate about them, you might just find yourself growing even more attracted to them. In addition, look for opportunities to hold hands, hug, and kiss to keep that affectionate feeling going. Sending them a flirty text is also a great way to set the mood. Even if sending dirty texts isn’t really your thing, send something coy and teasing to get both of you excited. For example, text something like, “I can’t wait to get you all to myself tonight ;)”"
