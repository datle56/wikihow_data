      "content": "Include a positive and powerful caption to motivate others . Life can be overwhelming and stressful at times, but hearing a positive message can help you stay focused and push forward. If you want to encourage people to chase their dreams or view their job in a totally different light, these captions are calling your name: Keep going! Seek discomfort. Choose to shine. Dare to be different. Escape the ordinary. Progress > perfection Never stop, never settle. Don’t be bitter, be better. The only limit is your mind. Effort speaks louder than words. Hustle hard and make it happen. Hustle and heart will set you apart. Grow through what you go through. Turning obstacles into opportunities. Diamonds are formed under pressure. First you learn, then you remove the “L.” Success is not a destination, it’s a journey. Dream big, work hard, and make it happen. The quieter you are, the more you can hear. Work hard until you don’t need an introduction. Lions don’t lose sleep over the opinion of sheep. Recognize your struggle to recognize your progress. Stronger than yesterday, braver than I ever imagined. Dreams mean nothing if you leave them on your pillow. Don’t tell me the sky’s the limit when there are footprints on the moon."

      "content": "Make sure your first sentence is the most powerful. According to social media expert Kasey Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. After a few lines of text, Instagram hides the rest of your caption, so include the most important and eye-catching details in the beginning. Most users are less likely to read a lengthy caption, so when in doubt, keep it short and sweet. Don’t be afraid to sprinkle in some emojis to add more personality and character! Social media and digital marketing consultant Candace Gasper also recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption."
