This leads to more creativity because you aren't afraid to consider an option that might lead to an uncertain outcome. And because fiction tells the stories of humanity, it opens your eyes to other perspectives and enhances your empathy . [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source To further boost your critical thinking, read fiction and nonfiction that's related in some way. For example, if you're reading Gone with the Wind , you might also read a nonfiction book about the American Civil War. Compare and contrast the depictions and look for patterns."

Grover notes that while the possibilities in chess are infinite, \"what is limited is the patterns in Chess.\" [7] X Expert Source Sahaj Grover Chess Grandmaster Expert Interview. 04 May 2021. Learning to spot those patterns will improve your Chess game as well as your reasoning skills. There are other games besides Chess that can help you improve your reasoning skills.

You'll also test your ability to think on your feet and come up with logically consistent arguments off the cuff.

And just like your muscles, your mind will weaken if you aren't working it out regularly. So make a list of things you've always been interested and look for ways you can learn more about them. [10] X Research source Try to start with something that's way outside your usual norm. For example, if you're really active and spend most of your free time playing sports, you might sign up for a pottery class at your local community center.

A lot of revolutionary changes occur when people realize that something everyone always assumed isn't actually true—that's the power of critical thinking. [13] X Research source One of the best questions you can ask is \"Why?\" Channel your inner four-year-old and ask why about everything you possibly can.

To boost your pattern recognition skills, make an effort to be present in each moment . Observe as many details of everything around you as you can and see what different patterns and relationships you uncover. [20] X Research source For example, you might go out to a park or café and people-watch, looking for patterns in the ways people are dressed or the ways they interact with each other.
