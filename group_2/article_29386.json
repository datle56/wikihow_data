All you need to know are these basic rules: [1] X Trustworthy Source Chabad.org Online resource for information related to Chabad-Lubavitch and Jewish culture Go to source The eight main lights should be in a straight line, all at the same height or along a steady diagonal line. The ninth helper light (shamash) should be easily identified. It's usually placed in the center or end of the row, but higher or lower than the rest. If it's the same height as the others, offset it so it's not in the same row. Ideally, set up the menorah near a window so passersby can see it."

      "content": "Fill small terracotta pots with sand. Nine small plant pots make a simple but beautiful display, even if you're craft-challenged. Make sure the pots are wide enough to catch any drips from the candles. Bury small candle holders just underneath the sand for stability, so the openings are at the surface."

      "content": "Use a line of bottles. Pick eight narrow-neck bottles of the same height, plus a ninth at a different height. Tear off the labels and wash off the label residue with soap and water. [2] X Research source You can now fit candles into the necks, or fill the bottles partway with water, float olive oil on the top, and hang a cotton wick from the neck to the olive oil. If you use candles, place a non-flammable plate underneath to catch the drips."

      "title": "Add the lights.",
      "content": "Add the lights. The light should last at least 30 minutes before it burns down. You'll need 44 lights to last the eight days of Hanukkah, but keep a few extra around just in case. The most common option is Hanukkah candles, which should last well over 30 minutes. To represent the original miracle more closely, you may use glass cups of flammable oil instead, ideally olive oil. See the Tips section below for instructions on making your own wick. On the last day, the candles are lit before sundown. Many people use larger candles to make sure they keep burning until the Shabbat."

      "content": "Gather your supplies. Parents and synagogues often teach young kids to make their own menorah this way. All you need is nine or ten metal hex nuts, nine candles that fit inside the nuts, a long slab of wood, and strong glue. You can find all of these at a hardware store. [3] X Research source Pick up any decorations you'd like to use as well. See below for some suggestions. If you can't find nuts that will hold up your candles, you can glue tea candles directly onto the wood instead."

Glue each nut onto the wood and wait for it to dry. [4] X Research source Weighing down the nuts with heavy objects will help the glue bond."

      "content": "Glue the nut for the helper candle. The ninth nut will hold the shamash, or helper candle. This candle is the one that will light all the rest, so it has to stand out from the rest. If you have ten nuts, you can stack two on top of each other so the shamash is higher. Otherwise, just glue the ninth nut anywhere that's not in the same line as the other eight."

Place the other four-candle holder on the right of the tall rectangle. Press the rectangle from both sides to join it to the other units. Press firmly to ensure joining and smooth the seams by rubbing the clay together with your fingers or a clay tool.

If you choose to decorate, read the manufacturer's instructions for any tips related to the specific clay you're using, such as sticking pieces together or using paints. This determines whether painting should be done before or after baking. There are lots of techniques for decorating clay prior to baking with common tools, such as toothpicks and toothbrushes to create textures. A six-pointed star made from 2 overlapping triangles is a traditional symbol used on menorahs. See How to light a Chanukah Menorah for instructions on use. Prior to lighting the candles, place a small amount of aluminum foil around the bottom of each candle, shaping it into a small cup so that drips from the candle will catch in the foil and not drip onto your creation."
