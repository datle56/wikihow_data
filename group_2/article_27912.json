      "title": "Combine the ingredients in a saucepan.",
      "content": "Combine the ingredients in a saucepan. Place the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice in a large saucepan. You may use fresh raspberries if they’re in season, or frozen raspberries, which are available year round and are picked and frozen at the peak of freshness. Stick with the minimum amount of sugar and lemon juice that the recipe recommends for now. More can be added to taste later if the puree turns out too tart or sweet. [1] X Research source If you are using frozen raspberries, allow them to thaw enough to separate from one another or defrost them in the microwave before heating to make puree. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook over medium heat.",
      "content": "Cook over medium heat. Turn on the stove to low-medium or medium heat and begin heating the raspberry mixture. The sugar will begin to melt and combine with the liquid from the raspberries and lemon juice, stewing the fruit. Cook for around 10 minutes or until the raspberries begin to break down and integrate with the liquid, stirring frequently. [3] X Research source Cooking on too high a heat might cause the mixture to scorch. Sugar in particular has a very low burning point. Make sure there is another liquid in the pan to dissolve the sugar so that it doesn’t burn as it melts."

      "title": "Pour the mixture through a strainer to extract the seeds.",
      "content": "Pour the mixture through a strainer to extract the seeds. Position a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the raspberry mixture over the top. The liquid will run through the strainer while the larger solids will be trapped. Use the back of a spoon to force the remaining fruit through the strainer until only the seeds are left. This method will result in a thick puree that contains some small chunks of the stewed raspberries. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Refrigerate the puree.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the puree. Chill the finished puree until it has had time to set up. The puree will thicken on its own as it sits. Take the puree out once it is ready to be used or served. You can also serve it warm as a topping for cakes, custards and ice cream, though it will be slightly thinner than puree that has been refrigerated. [5] X Research source Raspberry puree will stay good in the refrigerator for a week or longer. You also have the option of freezing the puree until you need it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blend raspberries, sugar and lemon juice together.",
      "content": "Blend raspberries, sugar and lemon juice together. Combine the 2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries, 1/4 cup sugar and 1-2 teaspoons of lemon juice in a blender or food processor. Blend until the mixture is smooth. The puree will still be somewhat thin at this point with minimal clumps or pieces of raspberry. [6] X Research source Be careful not to blend to the point that the seeds become ground up and pass through the strainer. Blending results in a puree with a much smoother consistency, making it ideal for use in sauces, smoothies, etc."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strain the mixture through a sieve or chinois.",
      "content": "Strain the mixture through a sieve or chinois. Pour the blended raspberries, sugar and lemon juice through a mesh sieve or conical chinois strainer. Because of how smooth the mixture will be after it comes out of the food processor, you’ll need to use a strainer with very fine grating in order to filter out the seeds. Chinois are most commonly used by chefs to strain purees."
    },
    {
      "title": "Freeze or refrigerate until needed.",
      "content": "Freeze or refrigerate until needed. Put the puree in the refrigerator to allow it to cool and thicken until you plan to use it. Purees also freeze well, and will retain their freshness far longer than the whole fruit. [7] X Research source Make raspberry puree far in advance or in bulk and freeze it to have it on hand for use in other recipes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change the proportions of ingredients.",
      "content": "Change the proportions of ingredients. Sample the puree as it's simmering or after it has been blended to ensure that the balance of sweet and tart flavors is just right. Recipes are important guidelines for making sure a dish comes out correctly, but the best cooking is always done to taste and can be altered based on personal preference. Add more sugar to give the puree a more dessert-like quality, or increase the lemon juice to bring out the natural acidic notes of the raspberries when the puree is used in other recipes. [8] X Research source Simmering the puree as opposed to blending it can give you more control over the flavor, as the heat will cook out the natural tartness of the raspberries, and sweetness and tartness can then be modified using sugar and lemon juice. Always taste purees and sauces as they're being prepared."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a sweeter puree.",
      "content": "Make a sweeter puree. Up the amount of sugar in the recipe, or supplement with confectioners sugar or honey for a sweeter variety of puree. Not everybody likes sour things, and the tart flavors of the raspberries and lemon juice can dominate when not counterbalanced by sweeteners. Sweetening the puree will make it more palatable when it is being served on its own as a topping or on the side as part of a dessert plate. Confectioners sugar blends and dissolves better than regular granulated sugar because of how finely it is ground. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Thicken it up.",
      "content": "Thicken it up. If you want your puree nice and thick, use 2/3 tablespoons of cornstarch along with 1/4 cup of water to bulk up the consistency. Cornstarch will do little to affect the flavor of the puree, but will thicken it nicely to allow it to stand up better to cooking, microwaving and thawing after it's been frozen. Thickened raspberry purees can even be used as fillings for cupcakes and pastries, which require that the texture be more substantial. Stir in the cornstarch a little at a time until the desired thickness is reached. Adding too much at once may cause the puree to congeal. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that the puree will thicken on its own somewhat as it cools."
    },
    {
      "title": "Substitute another liquid.",
      "content": "Substitute another liquid. Use orange juice, water or even honey in place of lemon juice to cut down on the tartness of the recipe. Raspberries are a naturally sour fruit, and too much acid can overpower the flavors of the puree. Try mixing the lemon juice with water first, and if that's still too tart, gradually add more water or replace the lemon juice altogether. [11] X Research source Don't use more liquid than the recipe calls for. If you're cutting the lemon juice with water, make sure the proportions together still add up to roughly 1-2 teaspoons. It is not strictly necessary to use lemon juice in the recipe at all. The acid in the lemon brightens the tartness of the raspberries and also helps preserve the freshness of the fruit, but all that is needed is enough liquid to break down the raspberries as they cook or blend."
