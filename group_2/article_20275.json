      "title": "Decide on your license class.",
      "content": "Decide on your license class. In many areas, you must apply for a contractor's license of a certain class. Usually, the class is determined by the monetary value of projects contractors will undertake. For example, Class C contractors might be limited to working on projects of $10,000 or less, Class B contractors on projects up to $200,000, and Class A contractors may be able to work on projects of any value. Fees and insurance requirements may vary by contracting class. Working on projects outside of the limits of a contracting class is a violation of regulations. Disciplinary or legal action can result. Seek the contracting class that suits the types of project you want to do, as well as your company's financial and physical abilities."

Your contractor's license will then certify that this company can operate. You must first determine that your intended company name is not already taken. Many states will have a name availability form you can fill out, or an online database you can check to see if a company name is not yet taken. You also need to decide on your contracting business' structure (sole proprietorship, limited liability corporation, etc.). If you plan on hiring employees other than yourself, you should also request an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS.

Since contracting work is often dangerous and involves large amounts of money, this insurance protects you against liabilities and covers any losses. In addition to or instead of insurance, you may be required to purchase a surety bond. This is essentially protection against loss in case you are unable to finish a project or complete it satisfactorily. The amount of insurance or bond that you must purchase will vary depending on your location and the type of projects you will do. However, expect it to be substantial. You will need to show proof that you have purchased the insurance or bond in order to receive your contractor's license."
