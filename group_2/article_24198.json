      "content": "Remove the old headliner. [1] X Research source Pry off all the trim that surrounds the headliner and holds it in place. Detach and remove all of the seatbelt covers, lights, speakers, visors and clothes hangers. You may also have to remove some of the upper A, B, C pillar panels to get the headliner to drop form the roof area. You may have to unscrew some bolts and/or pry some parts up with a flathead or torx screwdriver. Unclip any clips that are holding the headliner board in place. Slide the headliner board out of the vehicle and set it on a flat work surface. A large table or the floor will do. Remove the material from the car headliner board. It should peel off without much effort."

Alternatively 3M makes a spray adhesive that is much easier to work with. [2] X Research source Get the strongest glue you can. Because of the location of the headliner, many weaker glues will fail with heat."
