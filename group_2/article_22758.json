[1] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. If your cat seems angry or scared, you risk being scratched if you try to pick him up. With this in mind, there are some ways you can read your cat’s mood. Look at your cat's overall body language. Is he hiding from you or not coming out to play? Just like adults, cats need alone time, and if he is hiding it is a good indication he does not want your attention at the moment. Is he actively seeking attention, meowing , purring, or rubbing against your legs? These all indicate that he is interested in socialization. Rubbing against you in particular indicates he is trying to leave his scent on you, which is an affectionate feline bonding habit and indicates he is open to affection from you in return. Unlike dogs, cats’ tails don’t wag when they’re happy. A slow back and forth tail movement usually means your cat is assessing a situation. If your cat’s tail is wagging, it’s not a good time to attempt to hold your cat. [2] X Research source Look at your cat’s ears. Ears that are facing forward means your cat is feeling playful and content; this is a good time to pick him up. If your cat’s ears are facing backwards, watch out! Backwards-facing or flat ears indicate it's not a good time to attempt to hold your cat.

Crouching down to his level allows you to reassure your cat before you attempt to pick him up. It also gives him the chance to rub against your torso, which deposits his scent pheromones on your clothing and body and helps him feel more comfortable when you hold him."

      "content": "Reserve scruffing for emergency situations. Cats have extra skin on the back of their neck (called the \"scruff\"), which mother cats use to easily carry their kittens from place to place. However, an adult cat's body is quite heavy and it puts too much strain on the scruff to carry a cat this way routinely. If it is an emergency and your cat is scared, you can pick him up by the scruff, but be careful to support his body weight with your hand under his rump, using a towel to wrap the cat's body if it is struggling. Only scruff a cat if you need to move it quickly (for instance, if the house is on fire and you need to exit to safety). In these types of instances when a cat is highly agitated, scruffing a cat can prevent you from being scratched. You can also hold a cat by the scruff if you need to administer medication without the cat struggling, or if you have to handle a feral cat ."

[5] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. Lay your arm against your torso so that it forms a platform for your cat to rest on. You can support his rump in the crook of your elbow so that his front paws rest of your hand. When your cat is comfortable being held, you can try holding him in different ways--it really depends on your cat's personality. Some cats like to be held against your chest with paws up on your shoulder so they can see over your shoulder as you walk; others like to lay on their backs with their stomachs up like human babies.

Chances are, he will settle on your lap, either in the indent between your legs, or curled up on your lap. Be sure you instruct the child to let go of the cat immediately if it struggles or acts as if it would like down. Otherwise, the child may end up being scratched. [7] X Research source"

Put his front paws on the ground and support his hind end as he steps out of your arms, and release your hands gently. Your cat will do most of the work by jumping out of your hands."

[9] X Research source However, if the mom does not mind your presence or seems to actively encourage you to notice her kittens, you can briefly hold or pet even newborn kittens a few times a day. Doing so has been shown to help kittens open their eyes earlier and begin exploring earlier. [10] X Research source When the kittens are very young (two weeks or so), a few minutes a day is plenty of stimulation. Gently pick up the kittens one at a time supporting their chests and legs.

Cats can be very protective, depending on their personalities, and you do not want to cause her any undue stress or cause her to view you as a threat to her babies. If she seems overly protective, it is still important that you handle the kittens in the early days so that they become properly socialized to humans. Just try to time your interaction with the kittens for when she is out of the room (for instance, while she eats or uses the bathroom) in order to reduce her anxiety. [11] X Research source"

Respect their comfort by letting them get to know you a bit before you attempt to touch or hold them. Taking your time before touching or holding a strange cat also gives you time to assess the cat's personality and whether or not it is safe to continue. If you don't know a cat, consider it a wild animal. Since you have no way of knowing if a cat is friendly or not, or even whether it has a transmittable disease, it's best to err on the side of caution until you have reason to believe otherwise. [14] X Research source If a cat's owner is nearby, ask whether the cat likes to be touched or held before attempting this.

In situations where you must handle a strange cat for its own safety (for example, to remove it from harm's way), you can try holding the cat by the scruff of its neck. Gently but firmly squeeze the extra skin just under the base of the cat's skull.

If the cat remains still, say \"good\" and reward with a small cat treat or a scratch on the head or chin.

[19] X Research source Finally, add an actual lift when you say the word \"hold,\" and if the cat does not struggle when you lift her, say \"good\" and reward her while you hold her securely to your chest. Reinforce this new skill a few times a day for several days. After that, try reinforcing the behavior through means other than treats, such as head scratching."
