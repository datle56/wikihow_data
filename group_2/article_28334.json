These elements will give you a larger idea of the type of humor she enjoys. [2] X Research source Spending more time around her and her friends is a great way to get to know your crush better.

      "content": "Tell your jokes to others. You don't know how good a joke or antic is unless you try it out on other people. Your family may have heard the jokes you tell a million times, so try your humor out of your friends or at a party to see how it is received by others. If they find some things funnier than other, focus on the more successful elements of your humor and try to adapt others to make them funnier."

There are many different kinds of jokes out there in books, blogs, and videos, so pick some and memorize them. This way, next time you are around your crush, you can tell a great joke and no one will ever know it wasn't yours. Make sure you search for jokes that fit you.

      "content": "Practice. No matter what type of humor you decide you want to use on your crush, practice it. Comedic timing is important to any joke or antic, impressions can always use work, and sarcasm isn't easy to pull off. Try elements out of your family or practice in front of a mirror until you get it perfect. You don't want to tell the joke \"What happens to a frog's car when it breaks down? It gets toad away.\" and get the punchline wrong. You won't be able to impress your crush if you are stumbling over your words. [4] X Research source Practice will make you more confident when you are using your humor on your crush. She will see how sure you are of yourself and will appreciate your personality and strength of character. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Tell jokes. When you are out with your crush, pick the right moment to tell a joke. Whether it is one you got from someone else or one you made up yourself, making a girl laugh is a great way to attract her attention and make you seem sexier in her eyes. It can also be a great way to break the ice. Laughing will make you both feel more comfortable, easing the tension that often comes with new relationships. For example, use jokes that play on words. Tell jokes like \"What did the duck say when he bought lipstick? Put it on my bill.\" These kinds of jokes are humorous and are funny to everyone. [6] X Research source A well placed knock-knock joke is always a winning idea, and you can make it flirtatious as well. Try something like \"'Knock-knock!' 'Who's there?' 'You're.' You're who?' 'You're so cute when you smile.'\" It pays her a compliment and will most likely get her to smile. [7] X Research source Keep your jokes tasteful. You don't want to make the wrong impression by insulting your crush so early in your relationship. Keep them on topics that are appropriate for all types of people. Save the more specialized jokes for when you know her better."

      "title": "Use observational humor.",
      "content": "Use observational humor. Make funny comments about the things around you. Maybe you notice a large push/pull sign on a door and think it's overstated. Make a joke about it, such as \"Could that sign be any bigger? I think we get the point.\", then exaggerate your movements as you push the door open. Or maybe pretend the sign is wrong by pretending to pull and acting like it isn't working. It will let her know you are attentive to your surroundings and show her that you can come up with humor on the spot. [8] X Research source You can also incorporate sarcasm into these types of situations. If you see someone with a large truck, say something like \"I think that guy should buy a bigger truck. I hear the prices of Mac trucks are down this year.\" Dry wit is usually appreciated and will make her laugh. Just make sure you don't only talk in sarcastic remarks. She might think you are a negative person and not want to be around you. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Tease her.",
      "content": "Tease her. Find small things about her that you can pick on. Make a joke about how large her handbag is or the size of her sunglasses, anything that is small and unimportant. For example, ask her \"Plan on robbing a bank later? I think you can use your purse as the getaway car.\" Remember to keep your tone light and keep a smile on your face. You don't want her to think you are actually making fun of her. [10] X Research source Don't take it too far and hurt her feelings. Stay away from topics like her weight, what she looks like, or other things that might be a sore subject. You don't want to make her think you're mean or cause major offense so early in your courtship. Try making fun of yourself as well. This lets her know that you have a sense of humor about yourself and you don't take yourself too seriously. Say something like \"I'm a great driver. Today, I even got a note complimenting my skills that said 'Parking Fine'.\" Just remember not to take it too far and become too self-deprecating. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Perform physical comedy. You can liven up any moment with a bit of physical humor. Pretend to run into a door, falling down and acting hurt. You can also do a silly dance, pretend like you are going to jump on her back for a piggyback ride, or play wrestle with her. It's a more active way to make her giggle and can have the benefit of amusing those around you as well. You can also tickle her or pretend to mess up her hair. This allows you to touch her in a playful way that is different than holding her hand or putting your arm around her. [12] X Research source"

Pick a celebrity that you know she likes or someone you both know, like a mutual friend or a professor. This way, she won't miss out on the joke and can be laughing along with you. Make sure you test out your impressions on others before you try to impress your crush. You don't want her to be laughing at you because your impression is so bad instead of with you because it's great. [13] X Research source"
