      "title": "Start with the consonants that are pronounced the same as in English.",
      "content": "Start with the consonants that are pronounced the same as in English. There are several consonants in the Punjabi alphabet that are pronounced the same as their English counterparts (even though they're represented differently in Punjabi script). Get these out of the way using romanized letters so you don't have to worry about them. If you know English, you already know how to pronounce these letters. [2] X Research source Use an alphabet list, such as the one at https://mylanguages.org/punjabi_alphabet.php , to help you pronounce the letters of the alphabet. There's also a printable table of the Gurmukhi script available at https://www.sikhnet.com/files/images/2011/Gurmukhi-Alphabet.jpg . Note that some letters sound like their English counterpart, but are more limited. For example, the Punjabi consonant that makes the \"g\" sound only makes a hard \"g,\" as in the English word \"gate,\" never a soft \"g,\" as in the English word \"gene.\""

      "title": "Control your breath to practice aspirated consonants.",
      "content": "Control your breath to practice aspirated consonants. Punjabi has a number of aspirated consonants, represented in romanized text with an \"h\" after the consonant. This indicates that you should release a short puff of air as you make the sound of the consonant. [3] X Research source Some of these letters are represented in romanized text as \"dh\" and \"kh.\" There are some consonant blends, such as \"ch,\" \"sh,\" and \"th,\" that sound much as the same as they would in English, except they're slightly aspirated. For example, the \"th\" sound comes out sounding more like the \"th\" in the English word \"Thames\" or the country name \"Thailand.\""

    {
      "title": "Work on consonant sounds that don't exist in English.",
      "content": "Work on consonant sounds that don't exist in English. There are also Punjabi consonants that require a sound that doesn't exist in English at all. To produce these sounds, you make the sound you would expect to make in English, but with your tongue in a different part of your mouth. This takes some practice to get used to. [4] X Research source For example, there's a \"ch\" sound that you make by touching your tongue to the back of your front teeth while saying the \"ch\" sound. In Gurmukhi script, this letter looks like \"ਛ.\" For the letter \"ਕ਼,\" make a sound like a \"k\" in English, but produce the sound from your throat rather than from your mouth."

      "title": "Add Punjabi vowels.",
      "content": "Add Punjabi vowels. Punjabi vowels sometimes occur alone but are also produced in script as diacritical marks occurring above, beside, and below the consonant. There are 10 vowel sounds in Punjabi: 8 vowels and 2 diphthongs. In romanized Punjabi, these vowels are represented and pronounced as follows: [5] X Research source \"a\" sounds like the \"a\" in the English word \"about\" \"ā\" sounds like the \"a\" in the English word \"part\" \"i\" sounds like the \"i\" in the English word \"it\" \"ī\" sounds like the \"ee\" in the English word \"see\" \"u\" sounds like the \"u\" in the English word \"put\" \"ū\" sounds like the \"oo\" in the English word \"food\" \"e\" sounds like the \"a\" in the English word \"cake\" \"o\" sounds like the \"o\" in the English word \"go\""

      "title": "Include the 2 Punjabi diphthongs.",
      "content": "Include the 2 Punjabi diphthongs. \"Diphthongs\" are vowels that combine together to produce a new sound. In Punjabi, you only have 2 diphthongs to learn. Their sounds aren't far off from sounds you're already familiar with in English. Those two diphthongs as represented in romanized text are: [6] X Research source \"ai,\" which sounds like the \"ai\" in the English word \"aim\" \"au,\" which sounds like the \"ou\" in the English word \"bought\""

In Punjabi, the question to ask is \"tuhāḍā kī hāl he?\" [8] X Research source If you asked first, the other person will likely say \"ṭīk hā̃. tusī̃ kíddā̃?\" which means \"I'm fine, and you?\" You would respond simply \"ṭīk hā̃.\""

Start by saying \"mērā nā̃,\" followed by your name, then the word \"he.\" Then you can ask the other person what their name is by saying \"tuhāḍā nā̃ kī he?\" [9] X Research source If the other person asks your name first, simply tell them your name and then repeat the question in full to ask them theirs."

      "content": "Speak politely and respectfully. In Punjabi, as in any language, you'll be treated more kindly by people you meet if you use your manners by including polite words and phrases in your speech. These are especially important if you're asking someone a question or asking them to help you. Some important polite words and phrases in Punjabi are: [10] X Research source \"kirpā karkē\" (please) \"kimā\" or \"māf karō jī\" (sorry) \"vēkhō jī\" or \"dēkhō jī\" (excuse me) \"tànvād\" or \"shukrīā\" (thank you) \"tuhāɖā suāgat he\" or \"kōī nahī̃\" (you're welcome; reply to thank you)"

Music is a good way to learn any language because the rhythm and repetitiveness of the lyrics help you remember the words and phrases you learn. Search for Punjabi music online or on your favorite music streaming service.

      "content": "Watch movies and television in Punjabi. Search your favorite video streaming service or website for Punjabi videos that you can watch. News programs and unscripted shows are typically better if you want to get an idea of how normal people use the language to have normal conversations. [12] X Research source Scripted shows and movies can help you pick up additional vocabulary, especially if you want to be able to converse about a particular topic. Turn subtitles off when watching Punjabi movies and television shows. If you have them on, you'll be concentrating on reading the subtitles rather than listening to the speakers. Pay attention and try to understand what they're saying from the surrounding context."

If you live near a Punjabi-speaking community, you may be able to find someone nearby who is willing to practice the language with you. Otherwise, you can find a conversation partner online. [13] X Research source There are many websites, such as Conversation Exchange ( https://www.conversationexchange.com/ ), where you can connect with a native speaker to practice your Punjabi for free. Other sites offer similar services but may charge a subscription fee for you to use the site. #*On some sites, such as iTalki, you can find a professional tutor who will work with you to help you improve your speaking skills. These tutors charge their own rates, although most are less than $10 USD an hour. [14] X Research source"

[15] X Research source Many of these courses are several weeks long, but you may also be able to find programs that only last a few days. The prices for these courses varies widely depending on the length of the program, the institution offering it, and the location where it is offered. You could pay anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars."

In this region, you can practice your Punjabi-speaking skills with native speakers simply by striking up a conversation in the marketplace or at a café. [16] X Research source Many of the region's top tourist attractions are steeped in religious and cultural history. This is also a good place to visit if you are interested in the Sikh religion. Flashcards are very helpful for learning a new language. [17] X Research source You can write down the words that appear most frequently or the ones you think are most important. You don't have to memorize every single word you don't know. Try to tackle 20-50 words per lesson, day, or week."
