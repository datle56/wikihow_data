      "content": "Lavender is a soothing herb that grants peace and serenity. Believed to offer protection against both negative energy and psychic attacks, lavender is ideal for creating a calm, relaxing environment. Use it when you want to banish bad vibes and gain some tranquility in your life! It’s also thought to aid sleep and healing. How to use it: Burn dried lavender as incense or carry it around as an amulet. Lavender is also fairly easy to grow in your garden! To burn any dried herb, place them in a safe incense bowl that won’t be damaged by fire—something made of metal or ceramic, for example. Use a lighter or match to light your herbs on fire, then place the bowl in a safe place and let the flame die out naturally. Be sure to keep an eye on the bowl while the herbs burn."

      "content": "Sage is believed to be a powerful warding herb. Ever heard of someone burning sage to banish ghosts or cleanse a home? Sage has been used as protection for a very long time. Those who revere the spiritual properties of herbs believe that it wards away evil spirits and negative energy and has the ability to purify the air. [1] X Research source How to use it: One of the most popular ways to use sage is smudging , an old Native American tradition. Place a dried sage bundle in an incense bowl and light the end of it, letting it smolder without fully catching flame. Then, waft the smoke from the leaves throughout your home (or the room you want to cleanse). Just ensure all the doors and windows in the room are open before doing this! Garden sage is different from white sage, which is typically more difficult to cultivate. While white sage is commonly used for rituals and spiritual protection, garden sage works just as well!"
