[1] X Research source You might know after just 1 or 2 dates that the relationship isn't going to work out. For others, it might take 3 or 4 dates to decide. Either way, talk with the other person as soon as you realize you don't want to date them."

I hope you find someone great to spend time with!\" [4] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Matchmaker & Dating Expert Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. Don't feel like you have to break up in person. It's one thing to end a long-term relationship on the phone, but you're probably not emotionally invested in each other after just a few dates, so a phone call is totally fine."

In fact, if you give vague reassurances, the person might think they have a chance for a relationship with you later on. It's better to be completely honest if you don't think there's a connection. [6] X Research source For example, instead of saying, \"I'm so sorry this isn't working out right now. I just came out of a serious relationship and I'm not ready for dating,\" say, \"Thanks for meeting up with me the last few days, but this relationship doesn't feel like a good fit. I just wanted to be honest with you.\" Reader Poll: We asked 1129 wikiHow readers what the most important thing to keep in mind when breaking up with someone is, and 58% of them said being honest, but not unnecessarily harsh. [Take Poll] This is important for casual or short term relationships, too."
