      "content": "Decide if you are ready. The first kiss in any relationship often takes that relationship to the next level, so you want to make sure that you are ready before you make the first move. Maybe you are in a friendship with someone that you really care about and want to become more, or you are in a relationship and are ready to show your partner that you love them. Either way, you don't want to jump into something without thinking over the results. [1] X Research source Maybe kissing someone isn't a big deal to you, but when you kiss someone you love, it's usually more than just a casual flirtation. In this case, you want to make sure you are at a point where your words can match your actions, meaning you are committed to the relationship, or the prospective relationship. It could also be really sweet to tell your friend or partner that you love them along with your kiss. This really takes the relationship to the next level, but is very thoughtful and shows your partner that you care about them and are committed. If you are interested in kissing a close friend, because you realize you are in love with them, just remember to think about the possible results of this action. You don't want to ruin your relationship or make your friend feel awkward, so feel out the friendship to see if it is an appropriate time. They key to knowing if you are in love with someone may be that you are willing to take the risk in showing them, no matter the results."

      "title": "Observe your friend or partner.",
      "content": "Observe your friend or partner. Along with deciding if you are ready, you also want to figure out if the person you love is in a place where they want to kiss you too. Observe how they are acting around you to figure out if they share the same feelings that you do. [2] X Research source Is your love being especially flirty with you? Are they making romantic gestures to show you they really care about you? Do they seem committed to the relationship? Are they spending more time with you than usual? Do they help you without being asked? These could all be signs that they're in love with you or at least feel strongly about you. This step mainly helps prevent heartbreak in a relationship. Kissing someone you love who doesn't feel the same way about you can be embarrassing and also hurtful, so before you make a move you should feel confident that they would want to reciprocate."

      "title": "Know them intimately.",
      "content": "Know them intimately. This doesn't mean physically, but before you kiss someone you love, you should know them emotionally, because this will amp up the kiss and make it more meaningful. Kissing someone you love is different than kissing someone during a hook-up -- you want it to be special and communicate strong feelings towards that person. If you are not at a point yet where you know someone intimately, take time to get to know them. Maybe you fell in love with them because you saw how they interacted with others, but you haven't had the chance to know them personally. Taking this time to learn who they really are will help create a special kiss."

      "content": "Pick a location. One key to making a kiss special and magical is to kiss the person you love in an environment that you view as romantic. This doesn't have to be a stereotypical romantic scene, like on a horse-drawn carriage ride, but it can be something that feels sweet and magical to you. Think about some special spots that you have been to in your relationship or some spots that you think of as romantic. Plan to kiss your partner in one of these locations. [3] X Research source Some romantic locations are at a park with a lake or pond, in a secluded corner of a restaurant, at the beach, under the stars, on the top of a building with a great view, etc. Often times the best kisses are somewhere secluded and quiet, so the two of you aren't distracted. However, you can kiss your partner in a place a with a lot going on if you still feel that it would be meaningful."

As previously mentioned, choose a romantic location and plan a date that you and your partner would both really enjoy. Maybe you don't find roses and candlelight romantic, but you both love sporting events. Whatever you think would be the most enjoyable date, plan your night around that. [4] X Research source During your time together, there will need to be a time where it is appropriate to move closer to your love. If you are doing something where there's always a foot between the two of you, it may not be the best place to kiss. Plan a date where you can become close and intimate with your love."

      "content": "Make it unique to your relationship. The most romantic times in a relationship can also be the most thoughtful, when you've planned a date or given someone a gift because it means a lot to them. Don't just go with a classic \"date night\" but do something fun and different. Take your love to the first place that you met, or the place you first realized you loved them. For example, a couple may be really into books and so a romantic place to kiss would be in the secluded section of an old library. Or maybe they are really into the outdoors, so kissing in a canoe might be really sweet. If you think your partner would enjoy a classic date night, then do that! There is no perfect formula for a good date, so just do whatever you think your date would most enjoy."

In that case, kiss that special someone at a moment that feels right to you. It doesn't always have to be a planned out, perfect date, so when you are with your love and you look at them, realizing you are in love, then make the move at that moment!"
