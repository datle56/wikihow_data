      "content": "Toss a slice or wedge of citrus into your water to add a bright tangy taste. While a squeeze of lemon is a classic way to improve the taste of water, limes, oranges, and grapefruit are also tasty! Float the fruit in your water for a subtle taste or squeeze a few wedges of citrus into your glass for a stronger flavor. [1] X Research source If you float wedges or slices of citrus in a large pitcher of water, take the citrus out after 4 hours—any longer than this and the rinds can make the water taste bitter."

      "content": "Add fresh or frozen berries if you want to sweeten your water. Use a small handful of berries for each glass. Try raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, or blueberries. To help the water infuse with the berries, use the big handle of a spoon to lightly mash them in the bottom of your glass before you add the water. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Pro tip—if you want to float whole berries in your glass, put them into your cup first. Then, drop in ice cubes and fill the glass with water. The ice stops the berries from floating up and into your mouth when you drink."

      "content": "Slice up fruit like mangos, papayas, and watermelon for a unique sweet taste. Adding exotic fruit to water is a great way to try new fruits and flavors—slice up star fruit, kiwi, or kumquats and add them to a pitcher of water, or reach for juicy melons like honeydew and watermelon. Not only will they add tons of flavor to your water, but they'll look gorgeous too!

      "content": "Create your own spa water with refreshing slices of cucumber. Peel the cucumber if you want a stronger flavor. Then, drop the slices into your water and chill the water in the fridge until it's infused with the cucumber flavor—the longer you chill it, the stronger the taste will be. [4] X Research source Add a few sprigs of fresh mint or a wedge of lemon to complete this spa-like drink."

      "content": "Muddle mint, basil, or sage in your glass to add an herbal flavor. Put the herbs in the bottom of your glass and smash them gently with the handle of a large wooden spoon. The water quickly picks up the unique taste of the fresh herbs. To make custom-flavored water, pair fresh fruit with fresh herbs and experiment to find your favorite flavor combinations. [5] X Research source For example, try strawberry-basil water, watermelon-mint water, or lemon-thyme water. If you don't want a strong herbal flavor, put the loose herbs into a tea infuser and drop it into the water instead of muddling the herbs first."

      "content": "Put your kitchen scraps to use if you don't want to use whole produce. Save your fruit and vegetable scraps when you prepare meals and add them to a pitcher of water. For instance, toss cucumber ends and herb stems into a glass of water, or put apple peels, lemon rinds, and strawberry tops into another glass. Let the water chill for 2 hours in the fridge to absorb the flavor. [8] X Research source Since peels and skins can accumulate pesticides, reach for organic produce to use in your water. Store your fruit- or vegetable-infused water for 2 to 3 days in the fridge. You can keep adding water during that time, but discard the produce after 3 days because it will lose its flavor and texture."
