      "title": "Stay calm.",
      "content": "Stay calm. Experiencing pain is stressful, especially if the source of the pain is unknown. Feeling anxious, panicky, and fearful can actually make the pain worse. Shallow breathing can lead to hyperventilation, impair the ability of getting oxygen into the blood, and lead to more pain, like chest and muscle pain. [1] X Research source Try not to focus on the pain. Focusing your thoughts and energy on the pain you are feeling can actually make it worse. Try to relax and focus on other things. For example, think about the next steps you need to take to address the problem causing the pain. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Control your breathing.",
      "content": "Control your breathing. Take slow, deep breaths that come from your belly or diaphragm, as opposed to shallow breathing from your chest. This helps to improve the flow of oxygen in your blood, and helps to quiet the intensity of the pain. [3] X Research source Controlled breathing techniques are known to be effective in managing severe pain. Breathing techniques have been used for many years to help control the pain of childbirth.

      "title": "Assume a comfortable position and try to relax.",
      "content": "Assume a comfortable position and try to relax. Pain may be lessened by sitting in an upright and straight position, or possibly by lying down. Find a position that helps to reduce the pain so you focus on locating the cause of the pain. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Identify the source of the pain.",
      "content": "Identify the source of the pain. Sudden onset pain, known as acute pain, is usually a warning sign. The pain is telling you to pay attention. Some common causes for acute pain include broken bones, sprains or strains, minor scrapes and cuts or deeper lacerations, muscle cramps, burns, or a broken tooth. Acute pain is considered to be classified as nociceptive pain. The pain from stepping on a nail or touching a hot stove falls in the category of nociceptive pain. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t ignore sudden, excruciating, pain.",
      "content": "Don’t ignore sudden, excruciating, pain. In some cases, the sudden onset of severe pain may be the only warning you get that something is terribly wrong. For example, sudden onset abdominal pain may indicate a ruptured appendix, peritonitis, or a ruptured ovarian cyst. Ignoring sudden onset pain can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening outcomes, if the need for prompt medical attention is ignored. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Take action to control the problem.",
      "content": "Take action to control the problem. Once you have identified the cause of the pain, take steps to correct the problem if possible. Acute pain gets better, and can go away completely, once the reason for the pain has been resolved. Taking action to control the cause of the pain may include seeking medical attention. For serious injury or lingering, unexplained pain, medical professionals can help identify the problem and provide treatment options. Situations involving acute pain can last for a few minutes, or can linger for several months. Acute pain that goes unattended can turn into long term, or chronic pain."

      "content": "Allow yourself to be distracted. Chronic pain wants your attention. Focusing on other things, like watching a movie, enjoying activities with friends and family, reading, or starting a new hobby causes your thoughts to focus elsewhere. Simply focusing on other body parts also takes away from the attention going towards the feelings of pain. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Visualize",
      "content": "Visualize your pain getting better. Try to picture what your pain looks like, maybe imagine an arthritic joint, a pinched nerve in your neck, or the broken bone in your foot. Then imagine, or visualize, the area healing, or shrinking, or being less inflamed. [10] X Research source Part of visualization also includes allowing yourself to mentally escape. Float away in your mind to a relaxing and restful place or a favorite past experience. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stay positive",
      "content": "Stay positive . Chronic pain is difficult to deal with since it is always with you and can constantly eat away at your positive attitude.

[12] X Research source Consider talking to a counselor or therapist if you find yourself descending into negativity or becoming depressed due to your chronic pain."

These products often contain controlled substances that can be addictive, such as opiates. Some prescription opiate-free products are available, such as anti-inflammatory agents and tramadol. [15] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Older antidepressant agents, called tricyclics, some anticonvulsant drugs, and muscle relaxers are commonly prescribed to help manage chronic pain conditions. These agents work in different ways to control pain signals sent to and from the brain, and to relax muscle tissue surrounding the painful areas. [16] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Prescription only patches are also available. Some are applied directly over the painful area, these typically contain active ingredients like lidocaine, and some are applied anywhere that allows the medication to be absorbed into your bloodstream, like patches that contain fentanyl."

      "content": "Consider medical procedures. In addition to prescription pain medications, many procedures are available that are designed to treat conditions involving pain. Physical therapy, nerve blocks, localized anesthetics, electrical stimulation, or even surgery may improve your pain. Chronic pain symptoms are sometimes controlled by using nerve block injections that are performed as an outpatient. Let your doctor know if you are allergic to contrast dye, which is commonly used during the procedures. Depending on the site of the injection, common side effects include temporary numbness and soreness in the area of the injection site. Some procedures can result in droopy eyelids, temporary stuffy nose, and temporary difficulty swallowing."

      "content": "Ask your doctor about a TENS unit. For some types of chronic pain, stimulating the nerves in the area can help to reduce painful symptoms. A TENS unit, or transcutaneous electro-nerve stimulator unit, uses small pads that are placed near the area of the pain. This device is controlled manually by the patient.
