Hypnosis is actually a deeply focused state of mind that makes you more aware of suggestion and more receptive to those suggestions. [8] X Research source It’s important to remember a person under hypnosis will not lose control or be under the hypnotist's spell. Instead, the person will be more open to suggestion and guidance. Often, we are under some form of hypnosis or trance. Think of when you zoned out during class, or got lost in a daydream. Or when you got so wrapped up in a movie or TV show, you lose your awareness of the people around you. These are all instances of being in a trance-like state."
