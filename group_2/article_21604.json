      "content": "A hall pass is a note that gives you permission to be outside of class. In many American classrooms, teachers have special objects that a student must carry to show that they’re allowed to be outside of the classroom during class time, usually to go to the bathroom, the nurse’s office, or the library. [1] X Research source Hall passes are often laminated cards that have the words “hall pass” or the location where the student is going written on them. “I had to go to the nurse’s office, so my teacher gave me a hall pass to make sure I wouldn’t get in trouble for being out of class.”"

      "content": "In a relationship, a “hall pass” is permission to sleep with someone else. Just like a hall pass gives a student permission to do something they normally wouldn’t be allowed to do (leave the classroom during class time), a hall pass gives one or both partners in a romantic relationship permission to sleep with someone else. It’s essentially a “free pass” to be unfaithful, but only on a one-off basis. [2] X Research source Less commonly, the term “hall pass” can mean permission to go out with friends, rather than staying home with your partner. [3] X Research source Ex: “My girlfriend gave me a hall pass to hang out with the guys all night, so let’s go bar hopping!”"

      "title": "Celebrity “hall passes”",
      "content": "Celebrity “hall passes” Most of the time, the term refers to a person naming a famous celebrity to be their “hall pass,” i.e., the one person they can cheat on their partner with without repercussions. [4] X Research source For example, someone might say, “Harry Styles is my hall pass. If I were ever to meet him, my partner is totally fine with me shooting my shot.” In this context, the concept of having a “hall pass” is mostly a fun joke between partners, since it’s unlikely that either will actually meet the celebrity they’ve chosen."

      "title": "General “hall passes”",
      "content": "General “hall passes” Sometimes, partners agree on having a general “hall pass” for a period of time. This means that they each can sleep with someone else without it counting as cheating, usually in an attempt to temporarily feel “free” without any consequences. [5] X Research source This is the premise of the 2011 movie Hall Pass , starring Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis. [6] X Research source In this context, a hall pass can be a bit more problematic because one or both partners actually plan to sleep with someone outside of the relationship. There are a few reasons why you might want to think twice before implementing this version of a hall pass, and we’ll go over them below."

      "title": "“Hall passes” may not be healthy for romantic relationships.",
      "content": "“Hall passes” may not be healthy for romantic relationships. If you and your partner are using the “hall pass” to cover up real issues, rather than addressing them, it may end up causing more harm than good. [7] X Research source For example, if you've lost the physical spark between you and are trying to introduce a hall pass to spice things up, this may end up damaging trust and pushing you further apart. You also may think that you’re okay with your partner sleeping with someone else, then feel hurt or betrayed after the fact. If you and your partner are feeling less connected physically, it’s best to make an effort to grow closer and increase intimacy between you, rather than trying out a “hall pass.” Romantic outings that remind you of earlier times in the relationship (like going on a date at the place where you first met) may also help reignite the spark.

      "title": "A “hall pass” can also mean permission to break a rule in general.",
      "content": "A “hall pass” can also mean permission to break a rule in general. As a slang term, \"hall pass\" is most commonly used in the context of romantic relationships, but it can also mean that someone has free rein to do something that wouldn’t normally be allowed. For example: “My mom is usually really strict about family dinners, but since my sister just went through that break-up, she got a hall pass to eat up in her room.” “My coworker is always making mistakes, but he’s so likable that our boss always lets things slide. It's like he has a permanent hall pass.” “He was not very good in the movie, but he’s so talented that he gets a hall pass for one bad performance.”"
