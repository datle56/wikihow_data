      "title": "Apply beeswax.",
      "content": "Apply beeswax. This single-ingredient product is a safe and effective way to lock in moisture and prevent further drying. [1] X Research source Most lip balm products with additional ingredients cannot make the same guarantee."

      "title": "Choose lip balm with caution.",
      "content": "Choose lip balm with caution. You'd think any lip balm would work, since it's designed for this exact problem. Unfortunately, products that contain menthol, camphor, or peppermint are particularly harsh on damaged lips. Avoid purchasing products with these items listed as ingredients. Many dermatologists recommend petroleum jelly, but some disagree, stating that it may cause harm."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try lip moisturizers.",
      "content": "Try lip moisturizers. Unlike lip balms, which seal in moisture to prevent drying, lip moisturizers try to rehydrate directly. Some dermatologists recommend moisturizers that contain vitamins A, B, and E, or dimethicone. It's best when used right after a shower, as water, shampoo, and soap can dry out already damaged lips."

      "title": "Apply natural treatments.",
      "content": "Apply natural treatments. All-natural lip balms and moisturizers can be effective, but many claims are not supported by evidence. In general, waxes and fats are likely to help seal in moisture, including beeswax, shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter, and vegetable oils. However, essential oils and fragrances are more likely to irritate your lips than soothe them, and can even cause a major reaction. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Make homemade lip balm.",
      "content": "Make homemade lip balm. If you're not interested in buying products from a store, you can use items housed in your kitchen for relief. Keep in mind that most of these recipes are not vetted by professionals. It's best to stick to simple ingredients and avoid essential oils, or dilute them to 2% strength or less. To make a simple lip balm, take a cup of shaved beeswax, 3 tablespoons of coconut oil, and a teaspoon of vitamin E oil and boil them together over the stove. Remove from heat and let the concoction dry and solidify overnight."

      "title": "Exfoliate gently.",
      "content": "Exfoliate gently. A gentle exfoliant may help your lips, but too much can easily cause harm. Try applying a mixture of olive oil, honey, and sugar to your lips for 10 minutes and then washing it off. This should moisturize and soften your lips, but stop if you notice further damage."

      "title": "Consider flaxseed oil.",
      "content": "Consider flaxseed oil. Some websites claim flaxseed oil helps heal chapped lips by restoring essential fatty acids. This may or may not work, but be aware that flax can have dangerous effects if you have certain medical conditions, or an allergic reaction. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you decide to use it, you may apply a small dab of flaxseed oil directly to your lips. Flaxseed oil can also be used as an ingredient in dressings, salsa, and dips. You can also add a drop to foods like cottage cheese, baked potatoes, and popcorn. Be careful. Flaxseed oil does not last long, so make sure to use it within the first three months of purchase."

      "content": "Eliminate lip biting. Sometimes, the cause of peeling lips is the result of our own actions. Oftentimes, people bite their lips somewhat unconsciously when feeling anxious, bored, or stressed. If you notice your lips are peeling or cracked, try to figure out if you've been biting your lip. If you have, take measures to stop the habit. Try to figure out what situations lead to lip biting. Do you bite your lips when you're feeling anxious or engaging in certain social situations, like meeting new people or interacting with co-workers? Do you simply bite your lips when you're bored, like when watching TV or waiting for a bus? [4] X Research source After identifying what situations lead to lip biting, engage in anxiety and boredom reducing behaviors that do not have a negative effect on your body. You could try deep breathing, relaxing your muscles, or what is called a competing response. This is a behavior you engage in that makes it impossible to bite your lip. You could, for example, chew gum to occupy your teeth with an alternative activity. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Limit your exposure to allergens.",
      "content": "Limit your exposure to allergens. If your lip peeling occurs after exposure to a certain food, cosmetic product, or season it may be allergy-related. Cosmetic products, lip balms, toothpastes, dyes, and fragrances often contain material which irritates the lips, eyes, and mouth. If you notice your lips peel after using a particular product, you might want to ditch that item and opt for an alternative. Even if you don't believe your peeled lips are a result of cosmetic products, it's best to ditch the lipstick and lip balm until peeled lips heal. Such products can carry germs and peeled lips are more susceptible to infection. Certain seasons, like early spring, can trigger allergic responses due to the increase of pollen in the air. If you're sensitive to seasonal change, try spending more time indoors or purchasing over-the-counter allergy medications. Allergen exposure can also lead to mouth breathing, which puts strain on the lips by exposing them to more air and debris. This can cause peeling and chapping."

      "title": "Do not lick or pick at your lips.",
      "content": "Do not lick or pick at your lips. When our lips are dry and chapped, it's tempting to lick them and peel them to relieve symptoms. These habits do harm longterm, however, and can prolong the healing time for peeled lips. Do not pull at peeling skin. While it might be tempting, it does not actually provide relief. It usually causes pain and leads to bleeding, which increases the likelihood of infection and prolongs the healing process."

      "title": "Stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet.",
      "content": "Stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet. Dryness is one of the most common causes of dry, peeled lips. Making hydration a habit can prevent lip peeling from occurring long-term. Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day. Roughly 1.5 liters of water are needed for the average person, but depending on your lifestyle that number may change. If you exercise frequently or have a physically demanding job, for example, you may need more. In general, you should drink enough water that you rarely feel thirsty. If your urine is colorless or light yellow, you are probably in the right range. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Eating a balanced and healthy diet can help keep lips healthy. Food can provide about 20 percent of your total water intake. Watermelon and spinach are two examples of foods that are 90 percent or more water by weight. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the air in your home feels dry or if you live in a region prone to pollution and dry air, invest in a humidifier. This will keep the air moist in your home and make peeled lips less likely."

      "content": "Stay away from citrus fruit. Scrubs and balms that include lemon juice or other citric ingredients can irritate your skin and lips. They also cause sun sensitivity that may lead to rashes or blistering. [8] X Research source They probably do more harm than good when it comes to healing peeling lips."

      "title": "Avoid harsh exfoliant products.",
      "content": "Avoid harsh exfoliant products. Your lips are more sensitive than your skin. Even products intended for lip use may cause damage to damaged lips. Better to stick with gentle exfoliants instead of something like a facial scrub."
