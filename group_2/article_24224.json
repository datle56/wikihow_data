This is where you will access the wires to connect the starter. [3] X Research source If the panel is not attached with screws then you might require a socket set to remove nuts securing the panel. Depending on your vehicle you may also need to remove the lower steering column cover to access the ignition switch harness. If your vehicle has an anti theft system, it is likely that you will need to remove this cover. If you choose to connect your remote starter to other functions such as the door locks and overhead lights then you will need to remove the kick panel as well. This is located on the lower left-hand corner of the driver’s foot box."

      "title": "Connect all your wires properly.",
      "content": "Connect all your wires properly. It is very important that you securely connect all your wires. Loose wires can cause injury or major property damage. It is best to solder all your connections to ensure that they are strong. You should also use heat shrink tubing where possible and a good quality electrical tape where you cannot. To connect wires first strip away about 1/2-1 inch (1-2.5 cm) of the coating around the wire. If there are two wires then split them and insert the attaching wire between them. Wrap the attaching wire around the stripped wire and solder them together using the soldering iron. Once they are securely attached, wrap electrical tape around the connection and use ties to hold them in place. Lightly tug on the wires to make sure they do not become loose."

      "content": "Connect the ground wire. The ground wire will be part of the starter and is often black. Connect this by screwing through the ring terminal into a clean, unpainted metal surface in the kick panel area. This wire is very important for the proper functioning of your vehicle. Because it is so important, it is better to connect the ground wire to a location in the kick panel as opposed to being close to the ignition switch in the dash. Also, it is better to use a separate grounding location to prevent feedback through wiring that may cause computer failures."

      "content": "Locate the 12V constant wire on the vehicle and attach the power wire of your system to it. The 12V constant wire is the one attached to the battery and is usually found in the bundle of wires attached to the ignition switch. You can locate this wire by reading the vehicle’s manual and repair guides or testing with the multimeter. [4] X Research source If you see any yellow or otherwise noticeable wires, do not touch them! These are the airbag wires and must not be tampered with or unplugged. To test the power wires using the multimeter attach it to the wire when the car is off and the key is out of the ignition. It should read around 12V (or the battery voltage) constantly. Some vehicles will have more than one 12V constant wire. In this case identify which is fused at a higher number of amps and attach your primary power wire to this one. If your starter has two power wires, attach the second power wire on the starter to the additional 12V constant wire. Use a soldering iron to connect all wires. This keeps them from falling apart and potentially damaging your vehicle. Add further protection by taping them completely."

      "content": "Find and attach the accessory wire. The accessory wire supplies power to heat and air conditioning controls and supplies 12V when the key is in the first (accessory) position. Attach the accessory wire on the starter to the accessory wire on the vehicle. To find this wire attach the multimeter while the key is in the “off” position. The voltage should be zero in this position. Turn the key into the first position but no farther. If you have found your accessory wire, the voltage will now read around 12V (11.5-14V). Check that the voltage goes to zero ‘while’ you are cranking the engine (it will read 12V before and after cranking). [5] X Research source Some vehicles might have more than one accessory wire to control all the functions. In this case use a relay to connect additional wires."

The vehicle manual or repair guides should tell you which color this wire should be. Connect the ignition output wire on the remote starter to this wire. Once you have located this wire you can confirm its identity using the multimeter. Attach the multimeter to the wire while it is connected to a good ground wire and it should show no voltage. Turn the key to the first position and the voltage should still read zero. In the second position, before starting the car, there should be a voltage displayed on your multimeter. If there is, then you have identified the correct wire, if not then you must try again to locate your ignition wire. Some vehicles have more than one ignition wire. If so, use a relay to connect all additional ignition wires."

It supplies power to the starter solenoid when turning your vehicle on. Connect the starter wire output on your remote starter to this wire by soldering the wires together. Locate a potential starter wire to test with the multimeter. The voltage should be zero when the key is in all positions except while cranking the engine. If you think you have found the wire, start with the key in position two and then crank the engine. The voltage should read zero while the key is in position two, show 12V while cranking and then go back to zero if you release the key before the engine turns over."

      "content": "Connect the parking light and brake wires. The brake wire is usually found at the switch harness above the brake pedal but can also be found along with the parking light wires in the kick panel on the way to the rear of the vehicle. Connect these wires to the parking light and brake output wires on the remote starter. To find the brake wire press the brake pedal down while the car is on and use the multimeter to test the wire. The multimeter should read between 11.5-14V while the brake is pressed down. The brake wires in particular are important to connect because they prevent someone from driving off in your car while it is running from the remote starter."

      "content": "Connect any security, anti-theft and other optional components. Some systems might have additional steps for connecting to the door locks of the vehicle. Others might need a special system for getting around the anti-theft system that exists in your car. As always consult the manual or manufacturer of your remote sensor to find out which extra features your system has and where you should connect them. To connect to the door locks you can locate the wires in the driver’s side door. You may need an external relay, of which there are many different kinds. However the four most common include positive trigger, negative trigger, reverse polarity and multiplex door lock systems. Consult your vehicle manual or repair guides to determine which system your vehicle uses."
