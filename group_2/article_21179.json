But, if you’re having some trouble coming up with something or deciding between your favorite options, these tips can help: [7] X Research source Reflect on what your group does. Are you a gaming group? An all-girls group chat? A book club? Pick a name that represents what it is you do together. Consider the group members’ personalities. Do you all have a dark sense of humor, or do you like all things cute and cuddly? Choose a name that reflects your style. Think about how you want to be perceived. Can others understand what your group is about? Does it make you look cool or witty? Be inclusive. Does your group name make some members feel uncomfortable or left out? Be sure to pick something everybody loves. Consider longevity. Will your name stand the test of time, or is it named after a current fad that might become irrelevant later?"
