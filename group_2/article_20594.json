      "title": "Take shallow, rapid breaths.",
      "content": "Take shallow, rapid breaths. Tense up as many of your muscles as you can and take a series of short breaths—this can help activate a burst of adrenaline when you’re just about anywhere. [1] X Research source Taking slow, deep breaths is one of the best ways to calm down from a panic attack (an episode of intense fear where the body sometimes releases adrenaline). So, it makes sense that taking short, quick breaths could have the opposite effect in terms of your adrenaline levels. Stop this exercise immediately if you experience any difficulty breathing."

      "content": "Hop into a cold shower. Turn on your shower so it’s at an uncomfortably chilly temperature—anywhere between 50 and 60 °F (10 and 16 °C) should do the trick. Then, jump immediately into the cold water to enjoy a burst of different stress-related hormones (including adrenaline). [2] X Research source Taking an ice bath or jumping into a really cold pool or lake/ocean are other great ways to create this same effect for your body."

      "content": "Watch a scary movie or TV show. Pick out a horror movie or scary TV show to watch on your favorite streaming service, or see what’s playing on TV.

Not sure which scary movie to watch? It’s hard to go wrong with iconic titles like Psycho , Get Out , Alien , Nosferatu , and The Exorcist .

      "content": "Play a scary and/or stimulating video game. Horror video games go a step further than movies or TV shows by inviting you to live the narrative yourself.

[6] X Research source Some notoriously scary video games to check out include Resident Evil 7 , The Last of Us , Outlast , and Silent Hill 2 . While horror games are great for getting your adrenaline going, any game that gets your heart pumping could also be a worthy candidate, like extreme action games.

      "content": "Do a safe activity that triggers one of your fears. Risk-taking on occasion can release adrenaline in the body. [12] X Research source So, look for activities that really push you out of your usual comfort zone—if you’re afraid of heights, you might take an elevator ride to the top of a tall building. If you’re afraid of the ocean, you could sign up for a swimming or surfing lesson. Afraid of being rejected by your crush? Increase your shot at an adrenaline rush by shooting them a text and seeing what they have to say. The idea here is not to do something that could potentially hurt you. Closing your eyes while driving will certainly give you an adrenaline rush, but it's absolutely not worth the risk. Instead, stick to behaviors that would normally make you uncomfortable."
