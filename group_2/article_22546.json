      "content": "Measure your desired surfaces with a ruler or tape measure. Determine the length of your surface, such as a wall or table. Round your measurements to the nearest inch or centimeter so you can purchase a LED roll long enough to cover your intended surfaces. If measuring objects square or rectangular objects, it is helpful to start your measurements from a corner. If measuring circular objects, you can start anywhere you’d like."

      "content": "Purchase LED light strips in stores and online. You can find LED strips in home supply stores, electronic retailers, and various online companies. They come in either individual pieces or long rolls. Make sure the lights you select come with the required controller and A/C adapter, and select a roll long enough for your intended surfaces. LED strips costs anywhere between $10-40, depending on length. [1] X Research source You can buy LED strips in lengths like 3.28 ft (1.00 m), 9.84 ft (3.00 m), 16.40 ft (5.00 m), 32.80 ft (10.00 m), and 49.21 ft (15.00 m). Use small pieces when illuminating smaller objects, like end tables or mirrors. Use long rolls for accenting larger objects, like your bed or door frame. Purchase color changing LEDs for extra fun. Many come in remote-controlled or automatic color changing options. You can also control the brightness, as most are fully dimmable."

      "content": "Locate power outlets before you plan your LED placement. Your LED strips plug into a controller, which plugs into an A/C adapter. To power your lights, you will plug the A/C adapter into an outlet. Look around your home for nearby outlets so you can plan where to plug in your LED lights. If there are not outlets nearby, you can use an extension cord."

You can also add LEDs to the width of your cabinets if you’d like. [2] X Research source The length of LED roll will vary depending on the size of your kitchen. You can go with a 16.40 ft (5.00 m) roll and trim it to your desired length."

      "content": "Place your LED strips on top of floor molding to light up the room. After you install the LEDs, get a skirting board 1 ⁄ 2 in (13 mm) taller than your existing trim molding from a home supply store. Apply wood glue to the edges of the your new board and line up the edges so they are flush at the floor. Hold the boards together for about 30 seconds to ensure they bond together. [3] X Research source Your LEDs will be hidden behind the floor molding and will light up your walls. Use anywhere from a 16.40 ft (5.00 m) roll to a 49.21 ft (15.00 m) roll, depending on the size of your rooms and how many rooms you want to illuminate."

      "content": "Create a well-lit vanity by running LEDs around your mirror. Use a mirror at least 0.39 in (9.9 mm) wide. Placing LEDs around your mirror creates a brightly lit glow, helpful when applying makeup and styling your hair. By installing LEDs to your mirror, you can make a custom vanity for a fraction of the cost. [4] X Research source You can use round or rectangular mirrors. A 9.84 ft (3.00 m) or 16.40 ft (5.00 m) roll should suffice."

      "content": "Peel off the entire adhesive backing if you are using shorter strips. The adhesive side of your LED strip is protected by a thin plastic covering. When you are ready to install it, separate the plastic backing from the strip. The sticky side of your strip should be completely exposed. Do this for LED strips about the size of your arm span. It can be tricky to work with strips longer than your reach."

      "content": "Remove the adhesive backing as you go if you are installing long strips. Unroll about 1 foot (0.30 m) your LED strip, and remove roughly 3–5 in (76–127 mm) of the backing tape. As you stick the strip your surface, peel away peel away 3–5 in (76–127 mm) of backing. For long stretches of LED strips, gradually removing the adhesive backing makes it easier to work with. This way you don’t get the strip tangled or stuck to other objects."
