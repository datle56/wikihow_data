      "title": "Squeeze around 1⁄2 cup (120 ml) of shampoo into a mixing bowl.",
      "content": "Squeeze around 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of shampoo into a mixing bowl. Choose a shampoo that smells nice and that isn't too thin or watery. Measure out your shampoo and pour it into a big mixing bowl. [1] X Research source You could also use a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner, or a 3-in-1 shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. As long as it's shampoo, it should work for making slime! If you don't want to get shampoo in your measuring cups, you can squeeze roughly the right amount of shampoo directly into the bowl. If your slime isn't slimy enough, you can always add more shampoo or more cornstarch to get it right."

      "title": "Add 1 cup (240 ml) of shaving foam to the shampoo.",
      "content": "Add 1 cup (240 ml) of shaving foam to the shampoo. Give a can of shaving foam a good shake to make sure it fluffs up well. Point the nozzle of the can over your measuring cup and spray some shaving foam into it. Scoop the shaving foam into your mixing bowl and stir it together with the shampoo. Make sure you use shaving foam, rather than shaving lotion. You need it to be foamy and fluffy to make fluffy slime."

      "title": "Use food coloring or essential oils to customize your slime.",
      "content": "Use food coloring or essential oils to customize your slime. The shampoo and shaving cream will likely be white or a very pale color. If you want to make your slime brighter and more interesting, add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture and stir it in to combine. If you want to change the scent of your slime, add a drop or two of an essential oil you like! [2] X Research source Adding more food coloring will make your slime bright and vibrant. If you want a lighter, pastel color, add only 1 or 2 drops to the shampoo mixture."

      "title": "Mix in 1/4 cup (31 g) of cornstarch to thicken your slime.",
      "content": "Mix in 1/4 cup (31 g) of cornstarch to thicken your slime. Measure out your cornstarch and pour it into the shampoo. Use a wooden spoon or something similar to begin stirring everything together until it thickens up and becomes a slimy consistency. [3] X Research source You might need more cornstarch to get the right texture for your fluffy slime. Start with 1/4 cup (31 g) and add more as you need it."

      "title": "Stir in 1⁄3 cup (79 ml) of water 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time.",
      "content": "Stir in 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 ml) of water 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time. Pour around 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 ml) of water into a separate bowl. Use a tablespoon to scoop some water out and pour it into your slime mixture, stirring it until everything is combined. Repeat the same process 4 or 5 times, until all of your water has been stirred into the slime. [4] X Research source The amount of water you add each time doesn't need to be exact. If you don't want to use a tablespoon, add a small splash at a time."

      "title": "Knead",
      "content": "Knead your slime for around 5 minutes. Take your slime out of the bowl and place it onto a flat, clean surface. Use your hands to begin working the slime, stretching it and squishing it back together. After around 5 minutes, your slime should be easy to work with and ready for you to use! [5] X Research source If your slime is still too sticky, add a little more cornstarch and knead it in. Repeat this process until you're happy with the texture of your slime. If you want to make your slime more interesting, knead in some polystyrene balls or some glitter. This will give your slime a crunchy consistency, or make it sparkle."

Store the slime in an airtight container or resealable bag for up to 3 days. After a few days, the slime will lose its texture and become too sticky to play with. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of thick shampoo into a freezer-safe bowl. In order for your slime to work properly, you will need a very thick shampoo. Squeeze your chosen shampoo into a freezer safe bowl. [7] X Research source A thicker shampoo will make your slime softer and stretchier. For the best results, choose the thickest shampoo you can find. You can also use 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 toiletries, as long as they contain shampoo."

Keep spraying until you have around 1 cup of foam, before scooping it into the mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon or something similar to mix the shampoo and shaving cream together. [8] X Research source Shake your can of shaving cream or shaving foam for a few seconds before spraying it. Make sure you use shaving foam or cream, rather than aerosol shaving lotion. The lighter and fluffier your shaving cream is, the fluffier your slime will be as well!"

      "content": "Add in around 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) of table salt to make your slime slimy! Table salt will help thicken your ingredients to turn your shampoo and shaving cream into slime. Pour the table salt into your bowl and stir it for 1 to 2 minutes. The mixture should become stretchy and slimy. [9] X Research source If your slime doesn't thicken up properly, add a little more salt and keep stirring it. The amount of salt needed will change based on the type of shampoo that you use. Your mixture should begin to look like slime, but will still be very soft and sticky."

      "content": "Freeze your slime for 15 to 20 minutes. Once you slime has started to come together, put the bowl in the freezer to set up. After around 15 minutes, you can take your slime out and begin playing with it! If it begins to soften after a while, put the slime back in the freezer until it becomes slimy and easy to play with. [10] X Research source Leaving your slime in the freezer for too long will turn it solid, making the slime very difficult to play with. Similarly, leaving the slime out of the freezer will make it start melting and become too sticky. Once you've finished playing with your slime, throw it away to stop it from melting or freezing."

Add in around 1 cup (240 ml) of shaving cream and stir it to combine. [11] X Research source Polyvinyl alcohol is the same active ingredient in the glue used to make slime, meaning it's a perfect substitute. Make sure the peel-off face mask you choose has polyvinyl alcohol listed in the ingredients. You can add more or less shaving cream to change how fluffy your slime will be."

Add a few drops of contact solution to your bowl at a time, stirring to make sure all of it's mixed in. Keep adding contact solution until your slime is thick, stretchy, and fluffy! [13] X Research source The amount of contact solution you need will vary based on the amount of boric acid it contains, as well as the type of face mask you used. Only add enough to make your slime perfectly slimy! If you want a stretchier slime, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of water. Knead the water into the slime until the slime no longer feels wet."
