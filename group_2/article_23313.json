      "content": "Shine a blacklight on the piece to see if it glows green. Point a portable blacklight at the piece, and if it contains uranium, it will glow a bright green. Some pieces glow brighter than others, but as long as a piece glows, you know for sure that you've got a genuine piece of uranium glass. While you may have seen cartoon or comic book depictions that suggest otherwise, uranium doesn't glow because of radiation—it glows because of its chemical composition. [1] X Research source You can't tell how much radiation is in the glass based on how bright it glows—the brightness of the glow depends on the chemical mixture the manufacturers used. Some uranium glass pieces might not glow because the manufacturers added other colorants or chemicals to the glass mix that cover it up (although this is really rare). If the piece glows pink or purple under a black light, it's likely manganese glass. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for a hallmark or date on the piece if you don't have a black light. Many pieces have the year they were produced engraved or embedded on them (often on the bottom). Glassmakers also frequently leave a hallmark on the bottom of their pieces that can help you determine if the piece is uranium glass. If you know the name of the glassmaker, their location, and the year the piece was produced, you can sometimes tell definitively if the piece is (or isn't) uranium glass without having to test it with a black light. For example, any glass produced in the U.S. after 1970 isn't uranium glass.

      "title": "Ask the seller about the background of the piece.",
      "content": "Ask the seller about the background of the piece. If you're buying from an individual collector or antiques dealer, chances are they know a lot about the pieces they have for sale. They can often give you a lot more details than you would think to ask about, which can help you better evaluate the piece. [4] X Research source Many pieces have the year they were produced engraved or embedded on them. If yours doesn't, you might be able to date it by comparing it to other pieces made by the same glassmaker or talking to an expert."

      "title": "Check the radiation level with a Geiger counter.",
      "content": "Check the radiation level with a Geiger counter. If the piece glows, use a Geiger counter to find out how much radiation the piece is emitting. Simply hold the Geiger counter near the piece and check the readout. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that the levels of radiation in some of these pieces are so low they won't even register—but you'll likely get a faint reading if you hold the Geiger counter really close to the piece. Any reading at all indicates the presence of uranium.

      "title": "Uranium glass uses uranium as a colorant in the glass mixture.",
      "content": "Uranium glass uses uranium as a colorant in the glass mixture. The uranium in uranium glass is what causes these pieces to glow under a black light—and it's that glow that makes these pieces so popular. While they might be beautiful just sitting on a shelf, they're even better in the dark with just a black light shining. Under regular light, uranium glass might have a faint yellow or green tint. It's usually translucent, although some glassmakers created more opaque varieties. Uranium glass does emit radiation, although it's a very small amount. Even a relatively large collection of uranium glass wouldn't pose any danger to people near it. Uranium glass emits alpha and beta rays, which are pretty weak radiation waves that can be stopped by a single pane of glass."

      "content": "Vaseline glass is a specific type of uranium glass. Vaseline glass gets its name from its distinctive yellow color and translucence that makes it look a lot like petroleum jelly. Vaseline glass always looks the same under regular light, while uranium glass generally comes in a lot of different colors and can be translucent or opaque. [7] X Research source If you're having trouble telling the difference, just think of it this way: all Vaseline glass is uranium glass, but not all uranium glass is Vaseline glass."

      "content": "Most uranium glass was produced from the 1830s until the 1930s. Glassmakers started adding uranium to their glass mixtures as a colorant, and the otherworldly glow made the pieces really popular. With the onset of World War II, uranium was needed for other purposes, causing a steep decline in uranium glass production. [8] X Research source Uranium glass made a comeback in the 1950s and 1960s, especially with American glassmakers. This glass had extremely low percentages of uranium compared to the earlier pieces.

      "content": "Uranium glass is still produced in the 21st century. While there are very few producers of uranium glass left in 2024, there are still some around the world. These glassmakers typically make novelty items with a much lower percentage of uranium than pieces made before World War II. Uranium glass hasn't been produced in the U.S. since 1970. [10] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Knowing when and where uranium glass has been produced can help you identify a piece without using a black light or a Geiger counter. For example, if someone tells you they have a piece of uranium glass made in the U.S. in 1984, you know that isn't possible. Either they're wrong about when and where the glass was made, or it's not real uranium glass (no blacklight needed)."

      "content": "Yes, uranium glass is safe for you to keep in your home. Uranium glass has relatively low levels of uranium that emit low levels of weak radiation—less than you're exposed to as you go about your daily life on a regular basis. Even a sizable collection sitting in a cabinet wouldn't emit enough radiation to be a cause for concern. [11] X Research source Uranium glass pieces are generally considered safe to touch and handle, as long as they're not obviously chipped or broken. Any uranium glass produced after the 1950s uses depleted uranium, which has an even lower risk of radiation exposure. [12] X Research source"

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warns against using it for food or drink because you could ingest microscopic uranium particles. [13] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Regardless of the uranium content, antique glass includes many other chemicals, such as arsenic, that make pieces unsafe for anything other than display.

      "content": "Most uranium glass is relatively affordable. Most uranium glass is antique and collectible, which means that values can fluctuate wildly. At the same time, most uranium glass pieces are valued at under a hundred dollars, with even the most expensive pieces going for under a thousand. [15] X Research source The low price point compared to other antiques makes uranium glass a favorite among folks who are just getting started collecting or who want to collect something unusual with a bit of an edge."

Check out uranium glass forums to find out the best locations to search for uranium glass pieces to start or expand your collection. [16] X Research source For a lot of collectors, the appeal of uranium glass is in the search—half the fun is holding a black light up to ordinary-looking pieces in hopes of that tell-tale glow."

      "title": "Evaluate the market before you spend a lot.",
      "content": "Evaluate the market before you spend a lot. Like any collectible, some uranium glass pieces are quite valuable to collectors. But if you're just interested in picking up a couple of pieces for the novelty value, you can probably find them without breaking the bank if you know what to look for. [17] X Research source Yard sales and estate sales are great places to start. You can often get pieces super cheap if they're being sold by people who don't realize what they've got or that they could get more for it. Avoid online auctions or resell sites because you have no way to check for the presence of uranium before you buy the piece (and photos can be faked). There are also lots of online forums and groups for uranium glass enthusiasts if you're looking for more pieces or want to share your growing collection."
