      "content": "Approach him in person. This technique works better if you are face to face with your crush. This tactic requires you to trick your crush into calling or texting you to find out some sort of information. The key is to express interest in an activity but tell him you are in a rush. Start small and say, “hey James”. Then follow up with a question about an event he’s interested in or even what he’s doing over the weekend. Express an interest in the plans. Try something like: “let me know if you end up going to the event” or “maybe we can go together” As a result, your crush will be backed into a corner and may have no choice but to ask for your number. Once he calls or texts you, you can save his contact information to your phone."

      "content": "Make plans like he already has your number. Invite your crush to an event with a larger group of friends. Tell him that you can text the details later, and try to walk away. Your crush should realize that the two of you have never exchanged numbers and mention it right then and there. [1] X Research source It is essential that the event you invite your crush to is a group event. Group events are non-committal and less nerve-wracking. Your crush is more likely to respond favorably in this set of circumstances than he might if you invite him on a date. Try to make the group consist of people your crush knows casually but not too well. If the group consists of your crush's close friends, odds are, he will know someone else's phone number and just text that person for the details instead of you. Start walking away as soon as you make the invitation. If you hang around too long, your crush might ask you for the details then and there. Your crush will likely respond in one of three ways. With any luck, he will call or text you right then to store his number in your phone. If this does not happen and the event passes, he might ask you for your number afterward, so he doesn’t miss out next time. Of course, there is also a chance that your crush will not ask at all, in which case, he probably isn't interested in exchanging digits."

      "title": "Use an excuse.",
      "content": "Use an excuse. Instead of making plans, you can offer your phone number to your crush on a “just in case” basis. Think of a specific circumstance that you and your crush share and develop an excuse around that. If you can do this skillfully, your crush may even ask for your number without you offering it. [2] X Research source If the two of you share a class, use that as a starting place. Consider your options. If you are great at math and your crush struggles with it, you could offer tutoring whenever he gets stuck on a homework problem. Similarly, if your crush knows in advance that he will be absent, tell him that you are just a phone call away if he needs an update on what was missed. For a crush that shares an extracurricular activity with you: offer your phone number and tell him to use it if he needs a ride to or from school. When you and your crush root for the same sports team, use that as an opportunity to hand over your number. Say that you will miss the big game this weekend and ask your crush to text you with an update on the score."

      "content": "Trick your crush into calling you. When hanging out with your crush, mention that the ringer on your phone has been acting up and ask your crush to call it. This should prompt him to ask for your number. Once your crush calls you, you’ll get his number without even asking for it. You and your crush need to be talking alone so that no one else offers to call your phone instead. Once your crush calls you, act relieved about the fact that your phone went off. Make it convincing, but try not to get too carried away."

      "content": "Ask in person or online. If you know your crush well enough and communicate via email or social media, you can ask for her number while talking online. Asking in person works just as well, but requires a bit more self confidence. Bring it up during conversation. Being direct is a good thing, but time your directness to be more effective. Try to let the question appear organic in the conversation. Ask her out. If she is interested on going on a date, then ask for her phone number."

[4] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. Use the circumstances in your life to figure out an appropriate excuse. Focus on circumstances the two of you share to make the act more organic. A shared class is a great starting point. If the two of you are in the same group for a project, ask for her number so that you can arrange a meet-up for a project outside of class. Likewise, if you have trouble with a particular topic that your crush excels at, ask your crush if she might be willing to help you with your homework over the phone. Work is another great place to get a phone number organically. Ask for her number if you need someone to check the schedule for you. Alternatively, ask for her number in case she needs a ride to work in the rain. If you discuss interests or plans, you can use them as an excuse. For example, ask for her number to text her next week when the new season of your favorite show comes out, or when you will be traveling to another city.

      "content": "Give it time. As before, you should avoid using your crush's number that same night you get it. If you are too zealous about sending the first text or placing the first phone call, you might scare the apple of your eye away. If you used a specific excuse to get your crush's number, your first call or text should be made with that excuse in mind. If you did not have an excuse when you asked, however, you can call or text whenever you have something to say."

This might be better than nothing. This tactic will only work if your crush has a landline and if that number is publicly listed.

[9] X Research source Since she doesn’t know you have her number, she might find it a little creepy if you call or text suddenly without a decent reason. When you do call, make sure that your reason for doing so sounds justifiably urgent. Acknowledge that you got the number from a third party and explain why you needed it. For instance, you could call to ask a question about a shared assignment and explain that you got the number from a friend in another class. You could also text an invitation to a group event and mention who passed the number along to you. You could also just tell her that you wanted to call her to ask her out.
