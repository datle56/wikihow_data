      "content": "Lay out your curtains on a flat surface. Working on the curtains will be a lot easier if they're fully spread out. Using either the floor or a large table, spread them out and prepare to work. Try spreading your curtains close to the window you're hanging them in so you don't have to carry them through the house. For the best results using this curtain-hanging technique, opt for pleated curtains . Regular curtains can also be used, but they may need more finessing to achieve that pleated or folded look."

      "content": "Count the number of curtain hooks you have. Most curtains come with drapery hooks or pins that you can use to hang them up with. If your curtains didn’t, make sure to purchase those separately. Count your hooks and divide them in half, as each curtain will get one-half of the number of hooks. Remember that curtain hooks are sharp at one end. Be careful when handling them. Using gloves might be a good idea to avoid injury. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) down from the top of the curtain. Your curtains should be level with the curtain rod, so avoid inserting the hooks at the very top. Instead, measure about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) down and make a mark there with a pen or pencil. This mark notes where the top of the hook should rest when inserted. [3] X Research source Hold the curtain up to the hardware or curtain rod from which you plan to hang your curtains. This will help give you an idea of where and how you’d like the curtains to hang before inserting the hooks. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Push the hooks into each curtain seam.",
      "content": "Push the hooks into each curtain seam. Take the hook and insert the sharp side into the seam of the curtain on the back of the curtain. Push the hook up into the seam to make sure it is fully inserted. [5] X Research source Then, continue the process and insert a hook into every seam. Most curtains have a layer of fabric along the seam or pleat to indicate where to insert the hook or pin—look for that! [6] X Research source Check the front of the curtain to ensure the hook isn't peeking through. If this happens, reinsert the pin and manipulate the fabric so you're only piercing through the back side of the curtain. To make sure the hook is snugly in place, use a ruler or other hard object to push them up further. Remember to measure your hooks' distance from the top of the curtain periodically. If you're not careful, you could start putting hooks higher or lower than you mean to, and your curtain will be uneven."

      "content": "Install your curtain rod and ring clips. Secure your chosen hardware where you’d like to hang your curtains. Opt for a curtain rod that matches your already existing decor. Then, slide the ring clips to the curtain rod. [7] X Research source Try attaching the ring clips to the drapery hooks before lifting up the curtain so all you have to do is slip the rings through the rod. This can be especially helpful if you’re hanging the curtains by yourself. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Lift your curtains from the top. Once all the drapery hooks are in place, hold the curtain up to the curtain rod you’ll be hanging it from. [9] X Research source Lifting from the bottom or middle of the curtain can cause it to ruffle, so aim to hold right above the hooks. This is a lot easier with two people. One person can hold the weight of the curtain while the other attaches the hooks to the curtain rod. Double-check to make sure no hooks have slipped out while you were lifting the curtain."

      "content": "Loop the hooks into the rod links. The links on the curtain rod should have holes or attachments for you to put the hooks through. Starting at the far end and working your way in, loop each hook through its corresponding rod link. Repeat the process for the other curtain. [10] X Research source Starting from the end and working your way in is the best way to ensure you don't miss any links. Depending on the height of the rod, you may need a step stool or small ladder to reach it."

      "content": "Check to make sure every hook is fastened. With so many hooks to attach, it's easy to miss one. If you have missed one and don't notice, your curtains will be uneven. Before cleaning up for the day, do a final check of each hook and make sure it's attached."

You can slightly pull your curtains to ensure the rod supports their weight but do not tug hard. The rod and curtains weren't designed to hold a lot of weight, so you could damage them if you pull too hard. [11] X Research source"
