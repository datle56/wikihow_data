      "title": "Grab some brown paper, butcher paper, or a brown paper bag.",
      "content": "Grab some brown paper, butcher paper, or a brown paper bag. All of these types of paper can make an excellent book cover. This type of cover can be left as is, or made fancier with stamping, painting or decoupaging. You could also use other papers: gift wrapping paper, photocopied design paper, and any other forms of paper that you consider strong enough to form a book cover."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the cover.",
      "content": "Measure the cover. Place the brown paper down on a flat work surface. Center the book on the paper. If you are using a paper bag, you will want to cut the paper bag open so that it lays flat. Remove any handles as well. Your paper should be bigger than your book so that you have enough of it to wrap around your book and create pockets for the covers to slide into."

      "title": "Draw a horizontal line on the paper along the top and bottom edges of the book.",
      "content": "Draw a horizontal line on the paper along the top and bottom edges of the book. Use a ruler and pencil to achieve this. This horizontal line will be your guide for folding your paper to help form your book pockets."

      "title": "Remove the book from the paper.",
      "content": "Remove the book from the paper. Fold the paper in from the top and bottom to the drawn lines. You want to crease the paper on the horizontal lines you’ve just drawn. Note that folds can be made neater and cleaner by using a bone folder. A bone folder is a piece of plastic that looks like a knife. It is used to get perfect folds and creases without cutting the paper."

      "title": "Place the book back onto the folded paper.",
      "content": "Place the book back onto the folded paper. The back of the book should be facing down onto the paper. Center the book horizontally. Make sure that the sides of the paper are of an even length on either side of the book. Then make sure you line up the book so that the top and bottom are flush with your creases."

      "content": "Close the book while keeping the paper folded around the cover. Keep the folded left edge of the paper tightly in position. The paper should stay wrapped snugly around the front cover. You may have to reposition the book so that you don’t rip the paper on the book’s spine. If the paper is too tight, move the book to give it more slack. You want to wrap the book without ripping the paper."

You can now slide each cover into the pocket for a better hold. Provided the paper has been folded sharply and crisply, and the paper is of substantial heaviness, the cover should not need any taping down. However, you may want to tape the pocket down if you feel it necessary."

Or stick on a label and write the name of the book inside the label space. Ribbon or braid can be glued down the spine for added effect and strength. This can be nice if the book is for a wedding, guestbook, or another memento. You can also write the name of the book, or the name of your class on the front of the paper to make it easier to differentiate."

But, the non-adhesive method tends to be less damaging to the book in the long run. should you wish to ever remove the plastic covering, non-adhesive is easier to remove. You can also opt to make a plastic sheet protector book cover . The chemicals in the adhesive may eventually tarnish the book. Additionally, the adhesive method is not an environmentally friendly way to cover a book because recycled versions of it have not yet been created. Regular plastic coverings take a bit more work but can be easily removed. You can also try covering a book with plastic wrap . Contact paper book covering comes in a roll. It is usually available from anywhere that sells stationery or craft supplies. Most rolls will have measurements printed on the backing of the contact paper, which will help you to align the plastic."

Don’t trace the vertical edges as these parts will get folded in to create flaps. The extra width that extends past the vertical edges of the covers will turn into the flaps. If using the measurement for the felt provided above, this extra part should measure approximately 2 inches/5cm more each side.
