[14] X Research source If you’d rather call her, that’s fine too, just don’t ask her out via Facebook or text message or she may think that you are too nervous to talk to her. [15] X Research source Try saying something like, “Hi. You seem really cool! Listen, I am in a bit of a hurry, but I thought I’d see if you would be interested in going out with me sometime.

Little gestures like opening doors, helping her put her coat on or take it off, and paying for dinner can be very impressive to some girls. If you really want to wow her, show up at her door with flowers, take her somewhere fancy, and impress her with your food recommendations at the restaurant. [17] X Research source To impress her even more on your first date, find out what she likes through casual conversation and plan a date that incorporates those likes. For example, if she is a big fan of horror movies, take her to see the latest horror flick. If she is a Chinese food fanatic, take her to a Chinese restaurant for dinner.
