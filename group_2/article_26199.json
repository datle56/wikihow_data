      "content": "Know what logging in is. Logging is the process of identifying a user that attempt to access a service, information, or electronic device, such as a computer or mobile phone. This process is used to ensure that only those who are authorized may access the service, information, or device."

      "title": "Understand what a Username is.",
      "content": "Understand what a Username is. A username is the public identity of the user who is trying to access information, an online service, or an electronic device. It usually comes in the form of an email address, though some sites may use a phone number, or some other form of identification (e.g., an ID number). Some websites and services allow users to choose their own unique username. Each username for a particular service is unique. No two users are allowed to have the same username. The username is often viewed publicly by other users, as well as the service provider. Therefore, usernames are not generally expected to be kept private."

    {
      "title": "Understand what a password is.",
      "content": "Understand what a password is. Passwords are used to ensure that the person logging in with a specific username is indeed the rightful user. Passwords are chosen by the user when they sign up for a service account, or when setting up a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Users are expected to keep their passwords private and not tell anyone else what their password is. Some passwords are stronger than others. A strong password should not be easy to guess. It should be at least 8 characters long and contain a combination of uppercase, and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters. Avoid using words in your passwords. If you must use a word, consider using alternate spellings, or replacing certain letters with numbers or characters that look like letters (i.e. \"0\" instead of \"O\", \"@\" instead of \"a\", \"!\" instead of \"i\", or \"&\" instead of \"G\"). Avoid using the same password for all of your service accounts. This prevents hackers from gaining access to all of your accounts if they are able to crack one of your passwords. You should change your passwords frequently. Especially if you suspect someone has gained access to any of your accounts. Some newer smartphones, tablets, and computers now come with fingerprint and/or cameras that can scan your face or retinas. These allow you to log in using your fingerprint or face recognition to log in."

Most websites' or services' login pages can be accessed by clicking a Log In or Sign In link somewhere on the home page (usually in the upper-right corner). Then you'll enter your email address (or other types of username) in the \"Email\" text field and your password in the \"Password\" text field. You then click or tap a button to log in with your information. It's important to remember that not all sites handle logging in the same way. If you can't find an option which says \"Log In\" precisely, look for alternative options. If you do not have an account, you will need to tap Sign Up , Register or something similar to get an account. You will then need to fill out a form with your personal information and answer some questions to sign up for an account."

This adds an additional layer of security by requiring you to confirm that you are logging in using your smartphone. There are a few different ways two-factor authentication works. After logging in with your username and password, you may receive an alert on your smartphone, or a text message containing a verification code. If you receive an alert, you can tap Yes on your smartphone to verify that it is you trying to log in. If you receive a text message, you will need to enter the verification code in the text message to confirm that it is you trying to log in."

From time to time, you may find you are not able to log in to one of your accounts because you cannot remember your password. Don't panic. Most services have a backup identification method you can use to identify yourself and change your password. Simply click Forgot my password to begin the recovery process. The two main backup identification methods are email identification and a security question. Email Identification: Email identification is the most common form of backup identification. A verification email will be sent to the email address you used to set up your account with. You will need to check your email account to retrieve the email. In most cases, the email will have a verification button or link you click to verify your account. Then you will be able to pick a new password you can use to log in with. Security Question: When signing up for a new account or service, sometimes they will ask you to pick a security question that only you know the answer to (i.e. Your first dog's name, The name of the street you grew up on, etc}. You will need to input the correct answer when signing up for the account. If you need to recover your password, you will be asked this security question. If you answer the question correctly, you will then be directed to pick a new password you can use to log in with."

Your login information will then be stored on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. This information is not stored in any public capacity. There are benefits and risks to saving your login information: Benefit: Convenience. You don't have to enter your login information every time you want to log in.

Password or PIN: To log in with your password or PIN, use the on-screen keyboard or number pad to enter your password or PIN. Pattern: Patterns are made by connecting dots in a 3x3 grid. Use your finger to draw the pattern you set by connecting the correct dots in the 3x3 grid. Fingerprint: To sign in using your fingerprint, simply place your fingerprint over the fingerprint scanner on your phone. Facial Recognition: Some phones allow you to sign in using facial recognition software. To use this feature, hold your phone in front of your face so the camera can see your face. In some cases, it will scan your eyes. Hold your phone so that your eyes appear in the marked areas of the screen."
