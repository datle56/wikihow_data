It’s good to have a pre-determined portion of your garden organised for where you want to plant your mushrooms because most growing kits require a specific set of dimensions. [3] X Research source Most growing kits need 4x4 feet but check the specifications of your growing kit to make sure how much your one asks for. It’s good to pick a spot by a tree, as morel mushrooms grow more in abundance around them, especially ash and elm trees. [4] X Research source Having sandy soil will give you the best results.
