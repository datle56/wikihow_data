      "content": "Guys can send around 25- 50 likes every 12 hours. That may sound like a low number, but Tinder uses this limit because men frequently swipe right on every person they see. [1] X Research source Along with their undiscerning swiping, many men are less likely to send messages. Together, this behavior adds up to the conclusion that guys on Tinder aren't as serious about finding quality matches as women."

      "title": "A girl can send over 50 likes a day.",
      "content": "A girl can send over 50 likes a day. Why is their limit higher? Women tend to swipe right less often than men on Tinder, which appears to be a discerning behavior, and they have a higher chance to send a message to a match. When a girl uses her free likes sparingly, Tinder rewards her with more likes. [2] X Research source Tinder's algorithm also limits likes according to a few factors, like age and location."

      "title": "More quality matches.",
      "content": "More quality matches. If you're swiping indiscriminately, Tinder can't help you make quality matches. The limit is to encourage you to swipe right only on people that you like. That way, Tinder ensures that your likes get you quality over quantity matches ."

      "title": "Keeping the community safe.",
      "content": "Keeping the community safe. Tinder sees an over-liker as a potential threat (like a bot), so the like limits prevent anyone from liking too many profiles within a 12-hour period. A fake profile tends to harm the community and make receiving users of the likes unhappy, so they are then likely to stop using Tinder. So, the like limit prevents that from happening."

People who are serious about dating are more willing to pay for Premium, but bots aren't going to pay for the unlimited likes. So, by limiting the likes of free users, Tinder is encouraging more users to sign up for premium plans. [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source One photo that only shows your face might not be enough to convince other people that you're swipe-right material. So, pick a variety of options that show off your best features and great personality. Try to upload photos that: Show off different angles, and avoid hats or sunglasses (we want to see your face!). If you‚Äôre a guy, skip the photo of you holding a fish (it‚Äôs a bit of a meme online). Include one (but only one; no one likes a profile that's filled with group photos!) group photo of you having fun with your friends. This will show you‚Äôre a blast to hang out with. If you have a pet, upload a picture of you with your pet! People think pets are cute, so this should help!"
