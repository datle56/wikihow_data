      "content": "Yes, but it depends on how bad the tear is. Small tears along the outer one-third of your meniscus can heal independently, and might not need surgery. However, tears along the inner two-thirds of your meniscus cannot heal and usually need surgery. A doctor can pinpoint your injury and point you in the right direction for treatment. [2] X Research source The treatment your doctor recommends will depend on your age, symptoms, and activity level, as well as the type, size and location of the injury."

      "content": "Follow the RICE method. “RICE” is an acronym for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation, and it is the most effective protocol to recover safely and comfortably at home. [3] X Research source After your injury, the RICE method helps reduce any pain and swelling, while encouraging flexibility and healing. [4] X Research source Here’s what you need to do: Rest: Avoid the activity that caused your tear in the first place, and use crutches as needed to get around. [5] X Research source Ice: Use a cold pack to ice your injured knee for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. For your own safety, never ice your knee directly. Compression: Wrap an elastic compression bandage around your injured knee. Keep the bandage snug, but not too tight—if your knee feels tingly or numb, loosen the bandage. [6] X Research source Elevation: When you are sitting or lying down, prop your injured leg up so it’s above your heart."

      "content": "Take painkillers if your injury isn’t severe. If your torn meniscus doesn’t cause your knee to lock in place, you can take over-the-counter painkillers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to address the swelling and pain. Check-in with your doctor if your knee still hurts after 6 weeks; at this point, surgery may be your next best option. [7] X Research source Acetaminophen: Adults can take 650 to 1000 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Follow the label instructions carefully, and never use more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen in one day.

[9] X Research source With Advil, take 400 mg per every 6-8 hours. For either medicine, limit yourself to 1,200 mg per day. [10] X Research source Naproxen sodium: Take 550 mg for the first dose, then 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6-8 hours. Do not exceed 1,375 mg per day.

[14] X Research source A physical therapist might provide manual therapy, suggest icing and compression treatments, use neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), and suggest different exercises to help you recover. Eventually, your therapist will help you figure out when you can go back to an active routine. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Possibly, if the tear is really severe. During the surgical procedure, your surgeon will typically slide a tiny camera into your knee so they can clearly see the injury. Depending on the tear, they’ll either fix or remove the meniscus tear using tiny surgical tools. Afterward, your surgeon might suggest physical therapy to help support your knee and get you back in shape for your favorite sports and usual activities. [16] X Research source Typically, your surgeon will either perform a meniscus repair, where the meniscus is sewn back together, or a partial meniscectomy, where damaged meniscus tissue is removed. A meniscectomy is a good option for more severe tears, since they usually cannot heal back together completely, even with a repair.

You’ll feel worn out for a few days after your surgery and your knee might feel numb for several days, due to the incisions your surgeon made. [19] X Research source Your recovery time ultimately depends on the type of surgery you received, as meniscus repair surgery takes longer to heal than a meniscectomy. [20] X Research source After a meniscectomy, you can apply weight to your knee right away; walk without the help of crutches within 2-7 days; drive a car within 1-2 weeks; get full range of motion between 1-2 weeks; and play sports after 4-6 weeks. After meniscus repair surgery, you can put weight on your knee while wearing a brace; move without crutches within 4-6 weeks; drive a car between 4-6 weeks; get full range of motion after at least 4-6 weeks; and play sports after 3-6 months."
