      "title": "Find some big cardboard boxes.",
      "content": "Find some big cardboard boxes. You'll need at least two big cardboard boxes to make the main room of your fort, and even more than that if you want to make it bigger. Ask your parents if they have any old boxes from furniture or moving that you could use to make a fort. Here are a few other places you could find some cardboard: Ask at a supermarket or big store to see if they have any old cardboard boxes that you could take. Make sure the boxes are dry and don't have any funny smells in them. See if your parents could bring some home from work. If either of your parents works in an office, there might be cardboard boxes that they could bring home for you. Visit home improvement stores or department stores that sell furniture or large appliances. They'll be sure to have giant cardboard boxes you might be able to have Always get your parents to go with you when out looking for cardboard. They'll make sure you get it from the best places and can help you carry it home."

      "content": "Pick the biggest box to be the start of your fort. This will be the first room in your fort, so make sure you use the biggest box you have for the most space inside. Stand the box up so the open side is facing upwards. [1] X Research source If the biggest box you have is flattened, use some tape to put it back together. Unfold it so that it looks like a box again and then tape the flaps on the bottom together to keep it sturdy."

      "title": "Cut off the flaps on the open side of the box.",
      "content": "Cut off the flaps on the open side of the box. Use a pair of scissors or a box cutter to carefully remove all of the flaps, keeping them for later. Try and keep the cut as straight as possible, because this is where your roof is going to go. [2] X Research source Get your parents to help with the cutting if you're using sharp knives."

      "title": "Cut two pieces of cardboard the same size to make a roof.",
      "content": "Cut two pieces of cardboard the same size to make a roof. Find another box or piece of spare cardboard to cut two roof pieces from. Make sure the pieces of cardboard are the same width as your fort and at least as long. The longer your two pieces of cardboard are, the pointier the roof of your fort will be! Make sure the two pieces of cardboard are the same size or else your roof will be crooked. This will make a slanted roof with a point in the middle, but there are lots of other ways to make a roof. See what else you can come up with. As long as it covers the top of your fort, it's a roof! You might be able to use the cardboard flaps you cut off to make part of the roof. Tape two of the bigger ones together and cut another piece of cardboard the same size."

      "title": "Tape the roof to the top of your fort.",
      "content": "Tape the roof to the top of your fort. Use a long strip of tape to connect the two pieces of cardboard along the middle. Tape one side of your roof to the top of your fort, using a lot of tape so it stays in place. Do the same on the other side so the tape in the middle makes a point on your roof. [3] X Research source Use brightly colored tape to make your fort look even cooler. This part can be difficult if you're doing it on your own. Get a sibling, friend or parent to help out if you need it. Having someone to share your fort with can make playing in it even more fun!"

      "title": "Cut out triangular pieces of cardboard and tape them over the holes in your roof.",
      "content": "Cut out triangular pieces of cardboard and tape them over the holes in your roof. Lay a big piece of cardboard on the ground and turn the fort on its side, so the hole in the roof lines up with the cardboard. Use a marker to trace the outline of the roof onto the piece of cardboard, then cut around it to make your gable. Cut another one the same size for the other side and tape them in place. These pieces on the inside of the roof are called \"gables\" and help keep the whole fort stable. If you want to leave the holes in your roof open, you can skip this step. You could also cover them up with cellophane or paper later on to make cool stained-glass windows! You might need to cut off little bits and pieces of the cardboard to make it fit perfectly. If you can't move the fort around, you can hold or tape the cardboard to the top of the fort and trace around it instead. This might be a little more difficult to do by yourself, so get someone else to help out."

      "content": "Cut a door in the side of your fort. Now that your fort is all put together, you need to make a way inside. Choose which side you want to be the front of your fort and measure out the four sides of a door. Use a box cutter to cut three of the sides, leaving one of the longer ones to be a hinge for your door. [4] X Research source Cover the hinge on your door with tape to make it sturdier when you're opening and closing it. Tape a piece of cardboard or some string to each side of your door to make a door handle. This will make it easier to open and close. Make sure the door opens outwards so that you'll have more room on the inside of your fort."

Find another box that you can attach to one side of your main room. Think about what sort of rooms you want to add to your fort and choose a box the right size. You might need a bigger box for a bedroom than you'll need for a secret storage closet."

      "content": "Tape the flaps on the open side of the box together to make it bigger. Unfold the flaps so they make a straight line with the rest of the box. Use some long strips of tape on the inside and outside of the box to hold the flaps together and give you more room inside. [5] X Research source If the flaps are damaged, or you can't tape them together easily, you can also just cut them off. Make sure you cut in a straight line to make connecting the rooms easier."

      "content": "Tape your new room onto the side of your fort. Line the open side of your new box up with one of the solid sides of your fort. Using more tape or hot glue, connect the two rooms together. Make sure they're held together tightly so your finished fort stays in one piece. If you can line one edge of the new room up with an edge of the main room to make a flat surface, it'll be much easier to tape the rooms together. Always be careful when using hot glue, as you can easily burn yourself. Don't touch the glue or the end of the hot glue gun until it has completely cooled. Ask an adult for help for extra safety."

      "content": "Cut a door to connect the rooms. Climb inside the main room of your fort and work out where you want to put the connecting door. Cut around three sides of it to make a door. If you don't want another door on the inside, cut around all four sides to make a passageway between rooms instead. Start with a small door and make it bigger as you go. It's much easier to cut away cardboard than it is to add it back."

Try making a bedroom, or a gaming room, or a secret safe hidden in the wall. See what else you can come up with to add to your fort! Make sure you don't make your fort too big that it takes over the whole house. Ask your parents how big you can make your fort and make sure to add the most important rooms first."

Use a marker to trace the outline of the window before cutting out a window with scissors or a knife. Use leftover cardboard to make window frames in the windows. Make a cross out of thin strips of cardboard and tape it onto the inside of your window. Add some colored cellophane to make some funky colored windows. Cut a square the same size as your window and tape it in place from the inside."

Ask your parents to help you move the fort outside to paint it, or get them to help put down some newspaper so you don't get any paint on the carpet. Make sure to wait for the paint to fully dry before you start playing in your fort again."

Work out what you want your fort to look like and start drawing! Here are a few ideas to get you started: Add some bushes on the front, some tiles to the roof and a door knocker on the front to make your fort look like a house. Try drawing on some portholes, periscopes, and metal plating to turn your fort into a deep-sea submarine. Put a sign over the door and draw on some stands for fruit and vegetables to make your fort into a grocery store. What else could you sell from your fort?"

Tape them onto the roof on the inside of your fort and turn them on to brighten up any rooms that feel a little dark. [7] X Research source If your lights need to be plugged in, cut a small hole somewhere in your fort to thread the cables through to the nearest socket. Be careful when working with fairy lights. The lights can be quite fragile and might break easily if you're too rough with them."
