      "content": "Pin back fly-aways. If you have strands of hair that are too short to pull up but too long to let hang, try pinning them back. Bobby pins will more often than not be your constant companion in the weeks and months it takes to grow out a short haircut. Here's a quick guide for those a little out of practice: Make a deep part on one side of your forehead just above the center of one of your eyes. Then sweep that portion of hair to the side, using pins to hold it back. Then set with hairspray. Grab the portion at the front of your hair that's starting to fall over your forehead. Twist the section once or twice, then pin flat at the top of your head. The slight twist will add a bit of volume to the front of the section. Once the top of your hair is long enough to pull back, pin up the shorter sections underneath for a cleaner ponytail look. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make friends with gel and mousse. These products can help tame your hair when it's prone to looking wild and unruly. Test out a few different products to find one you like - if you're on a budget, ask your friends what they use and whether you could try a bit. You could also ask a stylist for product suggestions and recommendations—consultations are usually complimentary.

[3] X Research source For a matte look, find a putty or pomade that does not promote shine. Use a pea-sized amount of the product and apply it about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) away from your scalp. Style how you'd like. For a glossy or wet look, find a shine product like a gel, pomade, or wax. Use a small amount and work through your hair beginning at the base. If your style allows it, comb your hair to make sure there are no gel clumps left over. Mousse will be helpful for those with curls or anyone looking for added volume. For curls, use a palm-sized amount and work it through the bottom 2/3 of your hair (so not near your scalp), then flip your head and do the same to the underside. For volume, apply the mousse with your hand to the scalp area, especially around the apex and crown.

      "content": "Change up the texture. If you've got the tools at hand, try curling your hair for some added bounce to your hair-do. Curling is a neat trick to shorten hair that's in an awkward period between not short enough and not long enough. Alternatively, if your hair is curly or wavy you can straighten your hair for added length to get the style you desire."

      "content": "Wear a top knot. Leave the sides and back hanging down with the front in a small bun. An easy fix for those looking to get the hair out of their face, or for those frightened of bangs. If your hair in the front isn’t quite long enough for a bun, don’t fret, a small mini-ponytail is perfectly acceptable as well."

      "content": "Choose a one-length hair cut. A simple fix for those who’d like to avoid complications as their hair grows out. A blunt cut will rid your hair of the layering which can become awkward as short hair grows out. A blunt cut is equally useful for those hoping to regrow their hair evenly, as it keeps all sides at roughly the same length. A blunt cut may not be a good option for those with curly hair. Without proper layering and weight distribution, your hair will taper out into a pyramid shape."

Depending on how long your hair is, you can flare the length out to the side or keep it running straight down in line with your neck. For a fancier look, add a headband! It can be a wire or plastic headband, or even a fabric one."

      "content": "Play up your makeup. Draw attention away from your hair by making your face look more arresting. Do a bold, smoky eye, or wear a bright lipstick. (Remember, though: choose either a bold lip or a bold eye - doing both is too much). Extra-girly makeup can help you feel feminine and attractive while your hair is transitioning. You don't have to do everything: lips, blush, eyes, etc. For example, you can focus on your eyes, and just wear simple lip gloss over your lips. If you don't like wearing makeup but still want to be girly, try jewelry instead, such as a chunky bracelet or statement necklace."

Undoubtedly you already own eye-catching and attractive clothing, so really try to “wow” with your clothing while your haircut remains in the awkward stage. When shopping look for bright colors and provocative patterns; nothing distracts from a poor hair-do like an outfit that works. Non-hair accessories are desirable here as well. Necklaces and earrings especially (being so close to your head) are excellent style tools to draw the eye away from your hair."

      "content": "Get regular trims. It might seem counter-intuitive to cut your hair while you're trying to grow it out, but it will help your hair look good while it grows. Visit your stylist every 6 to 8 weeks and ask him or her to trim only as much as you need to keep the ends healthy. You may have to change your style as it grows. For example, a one-length cut might have looked great when your hair was short, but layers might look better as it grows longer."

Talk to your hair stylist about it for added input. With long hair in the front, there are usually many more styles to choose from. Unless you have your heart set on transitioning right back into shoulder- or arm-length hair, go for a trimmed back for access to more styles. Consider extensions if you just can't stand to manage your growing hair any longer, have them added if you can afford it.
