      "content": "Release your negative energy with breath and affirmation. Because honey jar spells are meant to attract sweetness, the space you perform them in should attract abundance. After setting your ingredients, take a moment and think hard about the negative thoughts that may be affecting you. Then, close your eyes, take some deep breaths, and release them on each exhale. It might even help to state some sweet, positive affirmations like: [1] X Research source \"I am ready to receive positivity in my life.” “I abandon what does not serve me.” “I deserve love and joy.”"

      "content": "Ground yourself with your ingredients. After you’ve released your negative thoughts, take a moment to truly acknowledge your space in all its glory. Sit in a comfortable position and focus on each of your senses. What can you feel? See? Hear? Hold each ingredient in your hand. How do they smell? Connect with yourself and your materials by being as present as possible. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Sage your ingredients.",
      "content": "Sage your ingredients. Burn some sage around each of your ingredients to physically and spiritually cleanse them. You are using your spell ingredients to attract success and healing. “Smudging” or saging them helps affirm this. While the sage you choose is totally a matter of preference, white sage (or bee sage) is a fun and intentional way to promote success for your craft involving honey."

      "title": "Write your intentions on the paper and sign your name.",
      "content": "Write your intentions on the paper and sign your name. Now that your space is ready to attract love and sweetness, begin your spell by writing your name and what you wish to manifest on your piece of paper. It can be something simple like “my relationships are bright and nourishing,” but if you have something specific in mind like “I am getting a job in ____ soon,” that’s great too! [3] X Research source Jar spells are never meant to control other people so don’t write anyone’s name on your paper without their permission. Write your intention in the past or present tense. You are attracting sweetness now, not in the future! To add a little extra sweetness, sprinkle the paper with a few drops of rose oil."

      "content": "Fold your paper three times and place it in the empty jar. Once you’ve written and affirmed your intention, fold your paper three times and place it inside the honey jar. While, technically, your note only has to be folded enough times to fit inside the jar, the number three is significant because it stands for self-expression and wholeness. Fold the paper towards you to attract good blessings into your life."

      "title": "Add your ingredients into the jar.",
      "content": "Add your ingredients into the jar. Now that you’ve filled the jar with your intention, it’s time to nourish that desire with all the sweet ingredients you’ve brought to your spell. Fill your jar with honey to attract love and success, lavender for relaxation and peace, crystals for confidence and strength, and rose petals, colored to suit your goal. It doesn’t matter how much of each you use, just make sure the jar is full. White rose petals stand for general success, red rose petals stand for passion, and pink rose petals stand for love. Feel free to add other spices and oils you like. Cinnamon often stands for protection while salt stands for positivity. You can also use the jar that the honey comes in for the spell."

      "content": "Eat some of the leftover honey. Some spellcasters recommend dipping your hands into the honey and licking a few drops off. Others recommend putting a tablespoon into a tea and drinking it. Either way, this process is meant to attract sweetness not just for your intention, but for yourself. Chants while licking honey or drinking your honey tea are encouraged. See what fun little diddies you can come up with!"

The candle wax should be colored based on what you’re trying to achieve: white for general wishes, red for vitality and inspiration, and pink for romance. Or all three! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a candle on top of your jar and light it. Once the jar has been blessed, take a white, pink, or red candle and light it on top of your jar. To avoid wax dripping, place your jar on a plate or over a sink if need be. [6] X Research source If you need to extinguish your candle, fan it or pinch it. Do not blow it out as this is a bad omen. The white, pink, and red colors coordinate with your intention. Red is for creativity, pink is for self-love and romance, and white is for gratitude and other successes. You may want to repeat the spell weekly and burn a candle on top of the jar every so often to refresh the spell."
