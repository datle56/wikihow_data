[1] X Expert Source Chloée Ohayon-Crosby Costume Designer & Wardrobe Specialist Expert Interview. 24 July 2020. You can either take a shower the night before or in the morning , but if you take a shower at night, you have a few more minutes of sleep in the morning. You don't have to wash your hair every day. People with drier, coarser, thicker hair can get away with showering it once or twice a week. But do wash your body every day to stay smelling fresh, especially if you regularly exercise."

If there's something that has to be left out (say an art project that has to finish drying), make yourself a note and leave it on top of your backpack to remind yourself in the morning that it hasn't been packed yet."

Center your outfit around that item, and piece it together to make it look good. Hang it in a special place or leave it close to your bed. When you wake up, you don't have to rush picking out an outfit in the morning. If you wear a uniform, make sure it is ironed and hung up in your closet. You do not want your clothes to look wrinkled and worn."

In fact, recent research says that hitting the snooze button can make you more tired. Avoid it if you can – it'll make you run late anyway. Give yourself 5 or 10 minutes more than what you think you need. This way if you're running behind, you're still on time. It's the worst feeling to be rushed in the morning and feel like you don't have enough time to do what you need to get done."

To spot-treat and cover your new breakouts, use a concealer that is made specially to hide and diminish acne. Experiment with how often you need to wash your face. For some people, two or three times is helpful. For others, once is as often as they can without drying out their faces. Also, only use oil-free skin products. Coconut, olive, and tea tree are the three oils that will help your skin. The rest, like mineral, will clog your pores and cause you to break out."

If it's a lazier day, take the time to straighten or curl it. If you want straight hair, dry your hair while combing it with a flat brush. You may want to actually straighten it with a thermal spray and a flat iron, also. If you want curly hair , skip the blow dryer, put some curling gel in your hair, and scrunch . You could also try \"plopping\" your hair , which will dry it sufficiently and curl it at the same time."

If you're worried about not wearing enough, bring those pieces with you so you can reapply at lunchtime. This could be part of your beauty routine, too, but the later you do it, the longer it'll last at school. If nothing else, just reapply some lip gloss and you're good to go."

However, stick to a couple of main colors and an accent color – you don't want to look like a clown with a lot of colors. The rule is to put everything on and then take one thing off. Alternatively, stick to the either/or rule. You can either wear a necklace or a bracelet, for example. Wearing too many accessories easily becomes overkill. They distract from each other, too. If you're wearing just a necklace, it'll pop more than if you're wearing a necklace, earrings, and a bracelet."

Neutral colored clothes should be your bread and butter. Also, as a rule of thumb, primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) and complementary colors (orange and blue, green and red etc...) always go well together. Nearby colors like indigo and purple harmonize nicely too. Mix and match colors until you find an outfit that pleases the eye. Remember to match the color of your shoes to the color of your outfit. Blue jeans match everything. If you're feeling daring, try an eye-catching monochrome look like an all red outfit."

      "content": "Accessorize appropriately. Depending on your school's dress code, add necklaces, bracelets, belts, sunglasses etc... into the mix. This adds depth to your look. If you're wearing neutral colors, use your accessory as an accent. A bright blue necklace or red shoelaces can bring otherwise drab clothing to life. [8] X Research source Don't overdo it. Too many accessories can make it look like you're trying too hard. Aim for one or two matching accessories per outfit. Don't over match your accessories. If you're wearing a mainly blue outfit, avoid blue accessories. You can match the color of your accessory to one of the understated colors of your outfit. A hint of red on your shirt and red earrings go very well together. Accessories are a good way to express yourself. A crazy scarf or unique hat makes for an intriguing look."

It's better to err on the side of simple and elegant than complex and busy. From there, you can accent your outfit with trendy shoes, bright accessories, or an interesting hairdo. On the other hand, if you just wear a t-shirt and jeans every day your style will get old. Try to find a reasonable middle ground."

Pay close attention to how your accessories and shoes interact with your outfit. Play around with your accessories until you find combinations that work. Match your necklace to the length of your neckline. Jean shorts and tank tops are a fashionable look for girls. Make sure you comply with your school's dress code, though. Layer with jackets and undershirts to add more color and depth to your outfit. Sweaters generally look great on girls. Apply a light layer of makeup. Makeup is a good way to bring out the natural beauty in your face. Other than your lipstick, makeup shouldn't be noticeable."

You can match easily with blue jeans and a light jacket. Wear a nice belt and matching shoes to round out your style. T-shirts are a basic but perfectly acceptable look. You can experiment more with colors once it's warmer and you can wear shorts. Colored and patterned shorts are very fashionable, especially if they match your outfit. When it's colder, layer with a light jacket, overcoat, hat, and scarf. Make sure all those elements are working together. Sweaters are a timeless look for boys too."
