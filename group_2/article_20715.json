Your hair should also fall over your eyes and past your ears. You want your hair to still be wet, but not dripping. If your hair is dripping, pat it dry with a towel."

Start the part on the right of your forehead and make it go straight back to your crown. Comb the hair above the part to the left, and the hair below the part straight down. [1] X Research source If you need to, use hair clips to hold the hair on top of your head out of the way. Justin Bieber's shaggy swoop is asymmetrical and angles to the right. If you want to make it angle to the left, then create the deep part on the left side of your head."

With each section, begin cutting where you left off at the previous section. [4] X Research source If you made your part on the left side of your head, then begin cutting the bangs on the left side. Angle them to the right. If the ends are too jagged, pinch your bangs between your middle and index fingers, and cut upwards into them with scissors. Keep a steady hand while trimming. Your bangs should be long enough to fall across your eyes. If your hair grows fast, however, you might want to cut them a little shorter."
