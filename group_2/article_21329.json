      "content": "Pick Meyer lemon trees for growing indoors. Meyer lemon trees are the best and most adaptable tree for growing inside. They produce plenty of small or medium fruits and their maintenance level is more friendly for beginners. [2] X Research source Pink variegated lemon trees also grow well indoors and are beginner-friendly. Buy a lemon tree at least 2-3 years old, as young trees may not grow as well indoors. Although you can grow lemon trees from seed, they are less likely to adapt to indoor climates and will not produce the same as their parent tree. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a deep plastic pot for your lemon plant. Plastic pots are ideal for lemon trees so you can move the plant around as the seasons (and light sources) change. Look for a plastic pot with plenty of depth to help your tree balance as it gets larger and produces fruits. [4] X Research source The pot depth determines how large the lemon plant can grow. About 15 gallons (57 L) is the minimum recommended pot size. [5] X Research source Choose a pot that has drainage holes to prevent your plant from getting waterlogged."

      "content": "Find a saucer large enough to fit beneath the container. Place a few pebbles or gravel on the saucer and add a little water before placing the container on the saucer and the pebbles. The water-filled saucer will help maintain a trace amount of humidity around your tree. You can cut a strip of landscaper's cloth and place it at the bottom of the pot to keep it from leaking dirt into the saucer. Replace the cloth when you transplant the tree so you don’t clog the hole."

      "title": "Place the lemon tree in the pot.",
      "content": "Place the lemon tree in the pot. Position it upright in the pot and fill the rest of the pot with soil. Press the soil around the plant's base down, making sure that no roots are left exposed and out of the soil. Bury the tree at the same level as it was in the older pot. Avoid covering the trunk with soil, as this can cause fungal infections."

      "title": "Water your lemon tree weekly.",
      "content": "Water your lemon tree weekly. If your lemon tree doesn't get enough water, the natural salts that it produces may accumulate in the soil. Keep the soil moist, but not waterlogged to prevent root rot. [9] X Research source If using hard tap water, you may need to drop the water's pH before giving it to your tree. Adding 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) white vinegar to 1 gallon (4 liters) of water will usually do the trick. If your tree’s leaves are curling, your tree needs more water."

      "content": "Fertilize your plant once every few months. Lemon trees grow well if they get plenty of nitrogen—you can find nitrogen-rich fertilizers at most plant stores. Feed your plant once every 3 weeks in spring or summer and once every 6 weeks in fall and winter. [11] X Research source An NPK fertilizer of 2-1-1 works well for citrus trees. Do not use fertilizers containing alfalfa meal or cottonseed meal. Fertilizers containing these meals can cause fungal diseases ."

      "title": "Set up a humidifier near your lemon plant.",
      "content": "Set up a humidifier near your lemon plant. Lemon trees naturally grow in humid climates. Placing a humidifier near the tree can keep the air from getting stale. Set the humidifier to at least 50% to give your plant enough moisture in the air. [12] X Research source Misting your lemon tree with water several times a week or when it rains can also restore the plant's humidity levels. If you live in a humid location, you may be able to get enough humidity from opening a door or window."

      "title": "Pollinate your lemon tree",
      "content": "Pollinate your lemon tree with a paintbrush. Because your tree won't have insects to spread its pollen around, you'll need to pollinate the plant manually for it to grow fruit. Rub the paintbrush against the plant's stamen and anthers, the pollen-covered buds around the middle of the plant's flowers. Transfer the pollen to the pistil, the bulb located deep in the center of the flower. [13] X Research source Repeat this process once a day to ensure pollination. Most lemon trees take 6-9 months to harvest after being successfully pollinated. [14] X Research source Your lemon tree may produce fruit even if you don't pollinate it, but the fruit will be larger if it is pollinated. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Thin out any heavy lemon clusters that grow. Once a cluster of small lemons appears on your tree, remove 2/3 of them to allow the remaining 1/3 a chance to grow large. Snip away the extra lemons with pruning shears, cutting carefully at the stalk. Too many lemon clusters can drain your tree of energy and stunt all of the fruits' growth. Many trees will drop fruit on their own. Wait a few months before removing any fruit."

      "content": "Test the fruits for ripeness with your thumb. As your lemons grow, apply pressure with your thumb to the rind. If the inside feels soft and plump instead of hard, the plant is ready for you to harvest. [16] X Research source The fruits can be left on the tree for awhile without becoming overripe. The fruits will usually stop growing once they're ready to harvest. They should also be a rich yellow color. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Prune your plant's roots if it stops producing lemons.",
      "content": "Prune your plant's roots if it stops producing lemons. Your tree should remain root-bound in order to keep its size in check, but some potted lemon trees will stop producing fruit if their roots get too pot bound. Remove your tree from its pot and use a sharp knife to shave 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.5 centimeters) of the roots around the exterior of the root ball. Keep the roots moist while you walk by spritzing them with water from a spray bottle. Repot the tree and prune approximately 1/3 of its foliage to balance out the pruned roots."
