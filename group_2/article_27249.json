      "content": "Combine pancake mix, eggs, milk, and vegetable oil in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Your batter should not be runny--it should be thick and gooey so it will stick to the cookies. If your batter is too thin, add 1/4 cup of pancake mix. [1] X Research source You can substitute funnel cake mix or waffle mix for pancake mix. Make sure it's thick enough to coat the Oreos. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Dip an Oreo in the pancake batter using tongs or your hands, coating it entirely with batter. The cookie shouldn't sit in batter too long or it will get soggy, so only dip one at a time and then put it straight in the oil. The batter should be thick and sticky enough so you can't see through it to the chocolate cookie underneath. If you hand-dip the cookies, just use one of your hands--then you can use your \"dry hand\" to start frying the cookies and you won't need to stop to wash. If the cookies are coming apart or crumbling, put them in the freezer for 30-60 minutes. This also prevents the cream center from getting too melted when you fry it."

      "content": "Pour 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) cooking oil in a heavy cooking pot. The pot should be deep enough so the sides are at least 4 inches (10cm) higher than the oil. When deep frying, there should be enough oil to completely cover the food you are frying, but the pot should not be more than half way full of oil. To fry, use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point and little to no flavor, like refined peanut oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil, or safflower oil. [3] X Research source If you don't have a heavy cooking pot, or one with a very thick, heavy bottom, you can use a wok or a deep sauté pan instead."

      "content": "Heat the oil to 375ºF (191ºC). Use a frying, candy, or thermocouple thermometer. These thermometers show temperatures up to 500ºF (260°C). [4] X Research source To check temperature of the oil, hold it in the center of the pan. If your thermometer clips to the side of the pan it will be easy to keep track of the temperature as you work. [5] X Research source If you don't have a thermometer, stick a wooden spoon, skewer, or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the wood, it's hot enough for frying. You can also use a kernel of popcorn to check the temperature. It will pop in oil that is 350ºF (178ºC), so you will know when it is close to optimum frying temperature. If the oil begins to smoke, it's too hot. Carefully remove your pan from the stove to cool."

      "title": "Put the coated Oreo in the hot oil.",
      "content": "Put the coated Oreo in the hot oil. Frying works best in small batches, so fry only 4 or 5 at a time, depending on the size of your pot. The cookies should have enough room to float around without touching each other and sticking together. [6] X Research source When adding cookies to the oil, the temperature will drop (especially if you froze the Oreos before hand). Keep the oil between 250ºF-325ºF (121ºC-163ºC) while frying. Attempting to fry large batches will not only cause your batter to stick together, it will also lower the temperature of the oil too low and the dough won't get crispy. [7] X Research source Be careful when cooking with hot oil. Don't throw battered cookies into the pot--this would cause spattering, splashing, and a dangerous situation. If you're afraid to use your hand to place the cookies in the oil, use tongs instead."

Don't walk away from the pot or they may burn or over cook. [8] X Research source Keep the cookies moving as they fry so they don't stick together. Allow the oil to heat up between batches, back to 375ºF (191ºC). Use tongs or a strainer to remove bits of batter that may be floating in the oil. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the fried cookies with tongs and place them on a paper towel to drain. Oil remains on the outer fried dough and won't reach the inside batter or cookie. Blotting excess grease will make this decadent treat slightly more healthy. [10] X Research source The oil provides the flavor and crunch of the cookie, so don't go overboard and soak up every last drop. [11] X Research source You can also drain the cookies on a wire rack, but using absorbent paper towel will remove more grease than letting it drip off on a wire rack."

      "content": "Wait for the oil to cool, then use a funnel to pour it into an empty bottle. You can reuse the oil for deep frying (make sure to strain and remove any bits of batter floating around) or bring the oil to a donation point (often a waste management facility). Never pour oil down the drain. It will block your plumbing. If you can't find anywhere to recycle your cooking oil, make sure the lid is on tight and throw it in the trash or pour it over weeds. If you plan to reuse your oil within the next few weeks, store it in a cold, dark place or the refrigerator so it will last longer. If you don't have a funnel, pour the cooled oil into a paper cup, then pinch the top of the cup so you can easily pour it into the mouth of the sealable bottle or container."

Allow the cookies a minute or two to cool so you don't burn yourself, but do eat them while they're still warm! Keep finished cookies in an oven on low heat (about 200ºF or 93ºC) if you're doing a large batch so they will stay warm until they are served. [12] X Research source"
