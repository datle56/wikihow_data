      "content": "The Loofah Code is a way for swingers to find each other. Originating in the retirement community of the Villages in Florida, the Loofah Code claims that those who participate in swinging hang colored loofahs from their car or golf cart so other swingers can recognize them. The color of the loofah symbolizes their sexual preferences and what “level” of swinging they’re comfortable with. [2] X Research source The Loofah Code may be used in locations outside of the Villages, but that is where it seems to be most popular. A swinger is someone who engages in consensual sexual activity with another couple or individual outside of their relationship. Both partners in the relationship agree to swinging."
