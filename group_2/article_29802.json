      "content": "Measure your head and divide its circumference by 2. Take a measuring tape and wrap it around your head where you want the hat to sit. Take the measuring tape off, note your measurement, then divide it by 2. [1] X Research source For example, if your head circumference is 22 inches (56 cm), your new measurement is 11 inches (28 cm). If you do not have a measuring tape, wrap a piece of string around your head, then hold it against a ruler."

      "title": "Draw a triangle on a sheet of paper based on your new measurement.",
      "content": "Draw a triangle on a sheet of paper based on your new measurement. The base of the triangle should be half of your head circumference. The height of the triangle should be whatever height you want the hat to be. [2] X Research source Drape a measuring tape across the top of your head. Decide where you want the tip of the hat to hang and then use that measurement for the height. For an adult hat, make it about 14 inches (36 cm) tall. For a child's hat, make it about 13 inches (33 cm) tall. However, it also depends on a person's height. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw a curve along the bottom edge of the triangle.",
      "content": "Draw a curve along the bottom edge of the triangle. Tie a pencil to a piece of string. Hold the end of the string at the tip of the triangle, then place the pencil at the bottom left corner of the triangle. Holding the string taut, swing the pencil towards the bottom right corner of the triangle, creating an arch. [4] X Research source You can also use a pen or marker instead of a pencil. If you have a compass, you can use that, too. The curve needs to start at 1 corner and finish at the other. You want to end up with a triangle with a curved bottom. You can draw the curve by hand instead. It will not be as neat or precise, but it will do."

      "title": "Cut your pattern out and trace it onto a piece of folded fabric.",
      "content": "Cut your pattern out and trace it onto a piece of folded fabric. Fold a sheet of red fabric in half with the wrong side facing out. Place the pattern on top of the fabric, with 1 of the triangle's diagonal edges along the fold. Trace the triangle with a tailor's chalk or pen. [5] X Research source Great fabrics to use include: faux fur, velvet, fleece, flannel, and felt. Make sure you are cutting along the curved line so that the triangle has a curved bottom edge and not a straight edge."

      "title": "Cut the pattern out adding a 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance.",
      "content": "Cut the pattern out adding a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Because 1 of the diagonal edges is already along the fold, you only need to add seam allowances to the bottom curved edge and the other diagonal edge. This is important. If you do not add seam allowances, the hat will turn out too small. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Sew the edge using a straight stitch and a 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance.",
      "content": "Sew the edge using a straight stitch and a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Start at the bottom of the triangle and finish at the top. Match the thread color to the fabric as closely as possible. If you need to, use sewing pins to hold the triangle together, but remember to take them out when you are done. It will be faster to do this on a sewing machine, but you can do it by hand. If you are using a sewing machine, backstitch when you start and finish sewing so that the stitches do not come undone. If you don't know how to sew, glue the seam together using hot glue or fabric glue. [7] X Research source"

You need to make the strip twice as wide as you want the trim to be, plus 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) for the seam allowance. For example, if you want it to be 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, cut it 4 1 ⁄ 2 inches (11 cm) wide. [8] X Research source White fur is the most popular, but you can use white felt or fleece as well. If you aren't sewing the hat, make the strip the same width that you want the trim to be. For example, if you want it to be 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, then cut it 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide."

Make sure that the narrow edges match up, then sew across them using a straight stitch and a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Use white thread for this. Again, you can do this by hand or on a sewing machine. If you are using a sewing machine, remember to back stitch. Because of how short the ends of the fur trim are, you shouldn't have to use sewing pins. If you need to use them, however, remember to pull them out when you are done."

Slide the trim over the bottom of the hat, then sew along the bottom edge using a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Use white or red thread and a straight stitch. [9] X Research source If you don't know how to sew, turn the trim right-side-out and slide it over the bottom edge of the trim. Glue it down with hot glue or fabric glue.

Fold the trim in half by tucking the bottom raw edge into the hat. Sew the bottom raw edge to the inside seam. You can also glue it to the inside of the hat instead. [11] X Research source Skip this step if you glued the fur trim down. You can sew the fur by hand or on a sewing machine with a straight stitch.

Hold the string taut and use the pencil to draw an arc from the 1 in (2.5 cm) mark to the 20 in (51 cm) mark.

[17] X Research source You can use tacky glue, white school glue, or a glue stick, but you will need to pin the hat together while the glue dries.

[25] X Research source If you are using hot glue, work 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) at a time, or the glue will set too fast. If you are using fabric glue or tacky glue, pin the felt while it dries.

[28] X Research source Tacky glue is not recommended because it takes too long to dry and the pompom may slide around as it dries.
