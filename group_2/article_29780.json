      "title": "Create a core with a crumpled up piece of paper or rubber bands.",
      "content": "Create a core with a crumpled up piece of paper or rubber bands. To start your rubber band ball, you’ll need something to wrap the rubber bands around. If you’re a beginner, try using a golf ball, ping pong ball, marble, a balled-up piece of aluminum foil, a wadded up piece of paper, or a small square piece of cardboard. For a challenge, make the core out of rubber bands following these instructions: [1] X Research source Select a short, thick rubber band, such as a band used to secure vegetables. Fold this rubber band in half, then in half again, then a third time (if possible) until you have a flat “stack” of rubber. Pinch the thick band flat and wrap a thinner rubber band around it. Twist the slack of the thinner band and wrap it over the thick one in the other direction. Continue to wrap and twist until there is no more slack in the thin band."

      "title": "Wrap rubber bands around the core.",
      "content": "Wrap rubber bands around the core. Place 2 rubber bands in a criss-cross shape over the core. You may have to twist and wrap them around the core a few times to ensure they’re tightly secure. [2] X Research source Start with the smallest bands first since they won’t be helpful once your ball passes a certain size."

      "content": "Add more rubber bands until the ball is smooth. Keep wrapping rubber bands to form a ball. Space the rubber bands evenly so that no one side of the ball is larger than any other. [3] X Research source A ball without an object in the core will start out lumpy, but it should become smooth when it reaches the size of a golf ball."

      "title": "Test the ball.",
      "content": "Test the ball. Toss the ball in the air or bounce it against the wall. Your new rubber band ball should have plenty of spring. Enjoy it as is, or keep adding more rubber bands and watch it grow. For the best bounce, keep wrapping rubber bands onto the ball until it’s the size of a tennis ball."

      "title": "Make a ball without twisting any rubber bands.",
      "content": "Make a ball without twisting any rubber bands. If you don't twist the rubber bands, they lie flat against each other, with no room for air. This makes the densest, bounciest ball. The trick to this is finding each new rubber band exactly the right size, so there’s no slack when you loop it around the ball once. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a massive rubber band ball.",
      "content": "Make a massive rubber band ball. Large rubber bands can be hard to find, which is why making a ginormous ball is one big challenge! The more rubber bands you add, the denser and harder the ball will be to bound. The largest rubber band ball in the world has 700,000 rubber bands and weighs 4,097 kg (9,032 lb). [5] X Research source Wear safety goggles once the ball is about the size of a basketball. The rubber bands can snap after this point, and you don't want them hitting your eyes. Rubber bands decay over time. To stop your ball from shrinking or breaking apart, put new bands on the ball regularly. [6] X Research source"

Take the ball and carefully cut it in half with a box cutter or knife. Only do this with adult supervision.

      "content": "Find all your rubber bands for free. Since rubber band balls are all about the challenge, why not make it a little harder? Try expanding your ball without paying for any rubber bands. Here are a few places to look for them: Ask friends and neighbors for spares. Ask postal workers, newspaper delivery people, and other door-to-door delivery workers. Look in shoe stores, which may use rubber bands to hold shoe boxes closed."

      "content": "Typically, it takes about 10 rubber bands to make a ball. While this number isn’t scientific, many rubber band ball creators say they need at least 10 rubber bands to make a small ball. This number can also change depending on what’s used as the ball’s core. You might need more than 10 rubber to cover a larger core completely."
