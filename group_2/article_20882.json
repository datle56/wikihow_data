Next, add some water to get your kitten’s feet wet. Once your cat is comfortable with wet feet, give your cat a toy to play with so they have fun in the water. [2] X Research source If your kitten stays calm, they’re ready for a bath. Unless your kitten desperately needs a bath, take the time to acclimate them to water. It’s helpful to start before you need to bathe them. If your kitten gets upset, stop and move them away from the water. Calm them down, and then try again. If you start bathing your cat as a kitten, they should get used to taking baths. Use a damp cloth to wipe down your kitten if you can’t get it into a bath. [3] X Research source"

Bath time is a new experience, and it’s natural for their claws to come out when they’re doing something for the first time. Long sleeves will help protect you from scratches. Your kitty isn’t trying to hurt you. At the same time, they may scratch you or try to climb up your arm out of instinct."

[5] X Research source First, decide if you want to wash your cat in the sink, bathtub, or a plastic container . Then, grab some kitten shampoo , Dawn dish soap , or baby shampoo . Finally, collect a washcloth, two towels, a cup, and some treats . Since Dawn dish detergent can be drying, only use it if your cat is extremely muddy, greasy, or has fleas.

      "content": "Get the room warm, because young kittens can’t regulate their body temperature. When they get wet, they could get very cold, so you have to be careful while bathing them. Warming up the room will keep your kitty comfortable. You might steam up the bathroom by running a hot shower, set out a space heater, or turn down the air conditioner. [8] X Research source You can also use a heat pad to warm the kitten once it’s wrapped in a towel after the bath. Simply wrap the towel around your kitten, and then set it on the heating pad."

      "content": "Gently hold the kitty by its scruff while cradling their bottom. The scruff is the loose skin on the back of the kitten's neck. They’re used to their mother carrying them around like this, so they'll naturally relax. [9] X Research source Use both hands while handling your kitten so they can’t wriggle free. Make sure you’re cradling the bottom of your kitten the entire time. You don’t want the cat’s entire weight to be hanging from the scruff because your cat could feel some discomfort. Since scruffing only works on kittens, only do it while your cat is young."
