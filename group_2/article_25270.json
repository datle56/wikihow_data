You don't want to jump into a relationship or say yes to dating a guy without thinking or just because you think it might be fun. Relationships take maturity and work, so it's best to first think about what you're getting into. [1] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source There are good reasons and bad reasons for wanting a boyfriend. Companionship and a partner to share life with are good reasons for wanting to seriously date one specific person. If you feel unhappy or incomplete, keep in mind that a person can't fulfill that for you.

Boyfriends can be a temporary cure for boredom or loneliness, but expecting them to be perfect and always there for you is not realistic. They’re imperfect, just like you. Did you know? On average, boys start dating at thirteen and girls start dating at twelve and a half. However, this is usually just casual dating that takes place in big groups. Experts recommend waiting until you're older for more serious dating. [3] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source"

If you want to one day settle down and marry someone special, then having a boyfriend is a good way to learn about being in a serious, committed relationship. But if you just want to have fun getting to know a bunch of guys, then being exclusive with a boy may not be the best idea. [4] X Research source Your ideas about dating will affect how you treat a boyfriend. If you want to get married, you will expect more loyalty and long-term plans out of a boyfriend than if you just wanted to date a lot of guys and weren't worried about being too serious."

      "content": "Look at your schedule to see if you have enough time for a relationship. Having a boyfriend is going to take up a lot of your time. In all honesty, you might be too busy with school, friends, sports, clubs and hobbies, or even trying to get a good night's sleep to add another thing into your life. Committing a few hours or days a week to spending time with a boyfriend is about the average time you'll need to set aside. Don't neglect your friendships or family. Dating can take up a lot of your time, and you don't want to be the person who disappears while they're in a relationship and then resurfaces only when a break-up happens. [5] X Research source However, technology makes it easy to have a boyfriend and still have a life outside of the relationship. You can text, call, or video chat if you don't have time to spend together face to face."

For example, you may want a career, or you might want to be married and have kids. A boyfriend can either help you reach these goals or hinder you—you just need to decide how dating will affect your plans. [6] X Research source Remember that you have time to figure things out. You're never too old to start dating and you're never too old to figure out what you want to do with your life. Don't worry about not having enough time. There will be plenty of boys to date, so you don't need to feel desperate about being alone or the only one in your friend group without a boyfriend."

[7] X Expert Source Supatra Tovar, PsyD, RD Licensed Clinical Psychologist (PSY #31949), Registered Dietitian, & Fitness Expert Expert Interview. 6 October 2021. Your safety and emotional health is more important that having an unhealthy relationship. Don't let anyone guilt you into thinking you have to have a boyfriend. A simple \"No, thank you\" or \"I'm not interested in dating right now\" can help deter anyone who wants to ask you out if you don't feel ready. If you're ever feeling pressured by a guy friend or a boyfriend, especially about sex, you have the right to step away from that relationship and say no."

      "content": "Be honest with yourself about your feelings. If there's a boy who wants to date you, truthfully consider if you like him back or if you're just flattered that he's showing you attention. Warm, fuzzy feelings can be the start to a relationship if you feel a connection. If that's the case, dating is an opportunity to learn more about another person one on one. [8] X Research source You always have the option to group date to help take the pressure off the both of you. One on one time can be daunting and can also invite physical temptations, so start going on dates with a boy in a group with friends. Be careful not to accept dates out of pity or start a relationship that way. It will end up hurting both you and the boy in the end. Watch out for boys who are much older than you. Age gaps can work, but not when you’re still young. If a guy is pursuing you and he’s more than a few years older than you, that’s a red flag."

They might suggest you wait until you're in high school, or even after graduating high school. You might not be able to decide if you can have a boyfriend right now if they want you to focus on school or other things. [10] X Research source When you talk to your parents, be sure to ask about curfew, if you can drive with your boyfriend, if you should group date first, or if they have any other specific rules for you. [11] X Research source Some good questions to ask your parents could include: \"When did you start dating?\" and \"Do you wish you had waited to start dating?\" Your parents have your best interest at heart, so you should try and respect their wishes even if you don't agree with them. To help convince them, if there's a certain boy you want to date, bringing him around to meet your parents might help your case. Your parents may have a better idea of your maturity level. And listening to them is a great way to prove to them that you are mature enough to make grown-up decisions."

It can be easy to get caught up in the thrill of dating and hearing about your friends' partners and want one yourself. Just keep in mind that just because everyone is doing something, doesn't mean it's the best idea. [12] X Research source If your friends aren't dating yet because of their parent's rules or everyone still hangs out in groups together, maybe you don't need to break away yet and have one on one time with a boy. Ask your friends if you can hang out with them and their significant other to get an idea of what it's like to date at your age. But, if your friends are happily established with significant others, you may be on the same maturity level as them and can handle having a boyfriend. Just make sure that whatever you decide, you make the decision for yourself and not for your friends. Be careful. Just because your friends might all have boyfriends/girlfriends, doesn't mean you have to have one. You might be old enough, but don't feel pressured to just accept any boy's offer for a date just because you want a boyfriend."
