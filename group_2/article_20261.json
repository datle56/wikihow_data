Some options include the TCL FLIP Pro, Orbic Journey L, Sonim XP3plus, or the Consumer Cellular Verve Snap. Your current mobile phone carrier likely offers a wide selection of standard feature phones, but you can also stop in an major electronics retailer (or even stores like Walmart and Target) to ask about their selection of phones without internet access. Some phones come with a basic version that have only voice and text options and a version that has internet and Wi-Fi capabilities. You may have to ask for help from your mobile carrier to find the version with no internet."

      "content": "Ensure the cell phone will work with your provider and in your area. Check with your mobile phone provider (like AT&T, T Mobile, or Verizon) to make sure the cell phone you choose is supported by their network.

You can often find this information on the manufacturer's website or by asking your carrier."
