      "content": "Limit how often you heat style your hair and use a lower heat setting when you do. Blow drying, straightening, and curling your hair too often can cause it to become brittle and dry. Using too high of a temperature can also cause damage. If it is not too cold outside, consider letting your hair dry naturally. If you must heat style your hair, use a heat protection spray first. Consider using ionic hairdryers. They infuse your hair with negatively-charged ions, which help seal moisture into your hair. [1] X Research source Use a lower heat setting or temperature on your hairdryer, straightener, or curling iron. It will take longer to get the style you want, but it will be kinder to your hair. Don't blow dry, straighten, or curl your hair every day. Even with a heat protection spray, too much heat can be damaging. Experiment with different hairstyles, such as natural curls, braids, ponytails, etc."

      "content": "Use the right shampoo and conditioner, and avoid anything that contains silicones and sulfates. Choose shampoo and conditioner intended for your hair type. In most cases, this will be dry or curly hair; if you have fine, dry hair, however, use shampoo and conditioner meant for fine hair. Look for products that contain aloe vera or apricot kernel oil for extra moisture and hydration. [2] X Research source Avoid washing your hair with hot water. Hot water can strip your hair (and skin) of its natural oils and moisture, leaving it feeling dry and dull. Silicones may help make your hair look shiny and smooth, but they can only be removed with sulfates. If you don't remove them properly, they will lead to build-up, which can cause your hair to look limp and dull. Sulfates are harsh, cleaning agents found in many household cleaners. They are great at removing silicones, but they also leave hair feeling brittle and dry."

      "title": "Don't wash your hair every day.",
      "content": "Don't wash your hair every day. It may sound gross, but washing your hair only twice or thrice a week is actually better for your hair. The more often you wash your hair, the drier it will become. If you must wash your hair every day, consider co-washing where you wash your hair using just conditioner. You wash your hair with shampoo only 2 or 3 times a week. Take care of how you wash your hair. Use shampoo mostly on your scalp, and conditioner mostly on the ends of your hair. If you have thick, coarse hair, consider using a regular, rinse-out conditioner first, and then applying a leave-in conditioner after you step out of the shower. [3] X Research source If you have mature hair, leave a deep conditioner in your hair (under a plastic shower cap) overnight. Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner in the morning as usual. [4] X Research source Co-washing is great for curly hair since it will keep your curls hydrated and make them less frizzy."

      "content": "Limit how often you dye, highlight, perm, or relax your hair. All of these styling techniques use chemicals, which can cause your hair to become brittle and dry over time. While there is little you can do when it comes to doing perms safely, there are a few things you can do to dye, highlight, or relax your hair in a less-damaging way: [5] X Research source Consider an ammonia-free hair color. You will likely have to go to a salon to get it professionally done, but it will be much kinder and gentler on your hair. If you have mature hair, use a hydrating/moisturizing hair dye. Consider getting a balayage done instead of regular highlighting. Balayage highlights your hair only from midway down. Because the roots are left natural, you don't have to do touchups as often. It also looks more natural. Consider a chemical-free relaxer. It will still be harsh on your hair, so it is best not to do it too often, but it will be gentler than the usual chemical method."

      "content": "Protect your hair from the elements, especially the wind and sun. Both of these can cause your hair to become brittle and dry. If it is a hot, sunny day, spray your hair with a UV protection spray or wear a hat; you can also wear a hat or hood during the winter to keep your hair from drying out. Here are some other things you should keep in mind: [6] X Research source Apply a rich, conditioning cream and a swim cap before going swimming. This will keep your hair from drying out in chlorinated water. Use a rich, moisturizing conditioner during the winter. Add a deep-conditioning treatment once a week to your hair care regime for extra hydration."

      "title": "Take care of how you brush your hair.",
      "content": "Take care of how you brush your hair. Always brush your hair starting from the ends, and never straight down from the roots. Also, never brush your hair while it is wet, as this can easily rip or tear it. Instead, gently comb your hair out using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. Once your hair is dry, you can brush it out using a wide-toothed comb (recommended for curly hair types) or a natural, boar bristle brush (this will help redistribute your hair's natural oils). [7] X Research source If you need to, use a detangling spray or cream to make brushing easier."

      "content": "Use a hot oil treatment for something quick and easy. Heat up 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of oil (like coconut oil or olive oil) and comb it through your hair. Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap and wait 20 to 30 minutes. Once the time is up, rinse the oil out, then wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. If you have very thick or very long hair, you may need to use more oil. To make the mask even more effective, sit under the hot sun or a dryer. The heat will help your hair absorb the oil better. Alternatively, you can apply the oil to your hair, wear a plastic shower cap, and sit under a hair dryer for a similar effect."

Wait 30 to 40 minutes, then rinse the mask out using warm water and shampoo. [9] X Research source If you don't have any coconut oil, you can use olive oil instead. Honey is wonderful for hair because it helps seal in moisture."
