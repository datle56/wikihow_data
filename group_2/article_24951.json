      "title": "Choose a 100 gallon (378 L) tank to give the fish room to swim around.",
      "content": "Choose a 100 gallon (378 L) tank to give the fish room to swim around. Bullhead catfish normally grow to about 12 inches (30 cm) long. A 100 gallon (378 L) tank gives the catfish enough room to freely move around and allows it to get plenty of exercise. [1] X Research source This size tank is appropriate for up to 3 fish. If you have more fish, you will need to get a larger tank. If you have 5 fish, opt for a 200 gallon (756 L) tank. Purchase a tank from a fish shop or search online for a secondhand one."

      "title": "Put 2 inches (5.1 cm) of gravel in the bottom of the tank.",
      "content": "Put 2 inches (5.1 cm) of gravel in the bottom of the tank. This substrate gives plants something to place their roots into and allows the catfish to dig into the gravel to search for flakes of food. Spread the gravel evenly across the tank to provide a base for the plants and decorations in the tank. [2] X Research source Purchase gravel from a pet shop or source your own from outside. Rinse the gravel under water before you place it into the tank. Avoid using sand as a substrate because this causes the tank to get cloudy and dirty."

      "title": "Add driftwood and caves to the tank to give the fish somewhere to hide.",
      "content": "Add driftwood and caves to the tank to give the fish somewhere to hide. Catfish enjoy having cover from light during the day. Tank decorations are a great way to provide shelter for the catfish and help the tank to look nice. Spread the decorations around the tank to allow the catfish room to swim around the obstacles. Push the decorations into the gravel to keep them stable in the tank. [3] X Research source Castles and large fish tank toys also work well in a catfish aquarium. Rinse driftwood under water before placing it in the tank."

      "title": "Fill the tank to the half-way mark with unchlorinated water.",
      "content": "Fill the tank to the half-way mark with unchlorinated water. Chlorine can negatively affect the health of your catfish. Use unchlorinated water to keep the fish at optimum health. If your tap water is unchlorinated, use this to fill the tank. If your tap water is not suitable, purchase unchlorinated water online or from a pet shop. [4] X Research source Only filling the tank halfway prevents the fish from jumping out of the tank and means that you don't need to use a lid. If you don't have unchlorinated water, consider using a dechlorinating agent to neutralise the chlorine in the water."

      "title": "Add floating plants to the tank to give the fish cover and oxygen.",
      "content": "Add floating plants to the tank to give the fish cover and oxygen. Bullhead catfish are nocturnal and often like to hide from light during the day. Choose aquarium plants that float on the top of the water and provide shade. Duckweed, Water lettuce, Hornwort, and Salvina are great floating plants. Purchase floating plants from a pet shop or an aquarium plant grower. Follow the planting instructions that come with each plant."

    {
      "title": "Choose tank companions that are larger than the catfish.",
      "content": "Choose tank companions that are larger than the catfish. Bullhead catfish will try to eat any fish that will fit in its mouth. Opt for fish that are at least the same size as the catfish. [5] X Research source Bullhead catfish are happy to live by themselves in a tank — making companions an optional addition to the tank. Large sunfish, perch, and cyprinids make good tank companions for bullhead catfish."

    {
      "title": "Place the tank in an area out of direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Place the tank in an area out of direct sunlight. Catfish are nocturnal, so they don't like intense sun exposure. If possible, place the tank in a dim hallway or room. If your tank is beside a window, close the curtains during the day to block the direct light. [6] X Research source If you can't place your tank in a dim area, cover the tank with a dark cloth during the brightest times of the day."

      "title": "Use a tank heater to keep the water temperature under 36 °C (97 °F).",
      "content": "Use a tank heater to keep the water temperature under 36 °C (97 °F). Bullhead catfish are really adaptable to different water temperatures. If you have other fish in your tank, keep the water around 26 °C (79 °F). If the bullhead catfish is the only fish in the tank, keep the water between 26 °C (79 °F) and 36 °C (97 °F). [7] X Research source Purchase a tank heater online or from a pet shop. Attach the tank heater on the side of the tank near the surface of the water and then select the appropriate temperature on the heating dial. Water temperatures over 37 °C (99 °F) can be fatal to bullhead catfish."

      "title": "Install a mechanical filter system that processes 150 gal (567 L) of water per hour.",
      "content": "Install a mechanical filter system that processes 150 gal (567 L) of water per hour. This filter system is appropriate for a 50-gal (189-L) tank, as the water in the catfish tank needs to be filtered 3 times per hour. If you have a larger tank, you will need a more powerful filter system. [8] X Research source Place the filter system next to the tank heater. Follow the instructions on the packet, as each filter system has a different setup process."

      "title": "Select an aeration system that oxygenates your tank to 4 mg (0.00014 oz) per 1 L (0.26 US gal).",
      "content": "Select an aeration system that oxygenates your tank to 4 mg (0.00014 oz) per 1 L (0.26 US gal). Fish can become stressed if there is too much or too little oxygen in the water. To set the oxygen level, simply turn the dial on the aeration system or follow the specific instructions from your system. [9] X Research source If you don't already have an aeration system, purchase one from a pet shop. Check your existing filter system for an aeration system, as many filters come with oxygenators. Place the oxygenator tube along the bottom of the fish tank and place the dial beside the tank."

      "content": "Keep the water pH between 3.4 and 7.0 using shells and driftwood. Bullhead catfish are extremely resilient and can withstand a range of pH levels. Use pH test kit to find out the pH of the water each day. If the water has a low pH, add a handful of seashells to the water. If the aquarium has a high pH, place a piece of driftwood into the tank. [10] X Research source Continue to add and remove shells and driftwood to naturally balance the pH level of the water."

      "content": "Replace 20% of the water once a month to keep the tank clean. If the water is left to sit in the tank for too long, the tank will get dirty. If you have a 50 gallon (189 L) tank, replace 10 gallons (18.9 L) of water each month. Use a bucket to remove water or use a syphon . [11] X Research source Replace the old water with unchlorinated water. Dispose of the old water in the garden or down the drain."

      "title": "Feed your catfish up to 1 handful of leftover fruit and vegetables each day.",
      "content": "Feed your catfish up to 1 handful of leftover fruit and vegetables each day. Bullhead catfish are scavengers and enjoy a varied diet. Chop the fresh fruit and vegetables into 0.75 in (1.9 cm) cubes, so that they will fit into catfish's mouth. Drop the produce into the tank and wait for the fish to search it out in the bottom of the tank. [14] X Research source Feed the fish a maximum of ½ cup (~25 g) of produce each day. If the fish stop eating the food, this shows that they are full. Bullhead catfish thrive off organic produce and fish pellets because they don't contain any pesticides. Look for products that are spray-free or organically grown to help the fish reach optimum health."
