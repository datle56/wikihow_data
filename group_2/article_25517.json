      "title": "He’s extremely smooth with women.",
      "content": "He’s extremely smooth with women. Boys who are players typically aren’t going to be nervous, stammering types around a girl. They will seem almost too practiced, and they will flirt with you with ease because it’s a game to them, and they’ve done this before. For example: They will usually have a rehearsed pickup line or a flirty joke. You may think he’s prince charming, but a player usually won’t get to know you before they try to impress you. As a result, their words may sound fake and artificial. [1] X Research source They're often brimming with confidence around you and may say things that you want to hear. A player is typically extroverted and outgoing. He'll talk a lot and enjoy being the center of attention. This isn't to say a guy who's genuinely interested in you will always be nervous, just that a player will likely not be stumbling over their words. Warning Sign: If a guy just met you and is already talking like you’re an item, chances are he’s a player."

      "title": "He showers you with excessive compliments.",
      "content": "He showers you with excessive compliments. At first, a guy who is a player will seem more interested in you than anyone has before. But as time progresses, he may cheat or leave you once he gets what he wants, which is typically physical intimacy and/or your affirmation. For example: He'll try to get you to feel important by showering you with flattery . He may pretend that you share interests so that you'll be amazed how much you have in common. Someone who’s genuinely interested in you will definitely throw in some flirty compliments every once in a while, but they will also make an effort to get to know you. Dating and relationship coach Maya Diamond says to spot a player, look for a lack of genuineness and excessive compliments or touches. A player's behavior will likely not indicate that they want a real relationship with you. Warning Sign: Be wary of “love bombing.” This is where he smothers you with praise, clings to everything you say, pampers you, and puts you on a pedestal. His flattery will likely focus primarily on your looks."

      "title": "He avoids saying anything that may suggest he wants a long-term relationship.",
      "content": "He avoids saying anything that may suggest he wants a long-term relationship. There are certain words that a player is likely to never say to you. Although he may be very talkative, he’s likely not going to say anything that suggests he wants a future with you. He may remain intentionally vague about seeing a future with you or avoid having deeper talks in general. A player is unlikely to say “I love you.” They might say it to get what they want and not mean it, but generally speaking, a player won’t utter those words because he doesn’t want you to think this is long term. [2] X Research source A guy who’s genuinely interested in you will usually be interested in talking about his future with you, where you want to live, and family plans, especially as you start to get serious. [3] X Research source Diamond says a player is someone who doesn't really want a relationship. They may want sex and attention, but they’re usually not being honest about their intentions."

    {
      "title": "He talks negatively about his past relationships.",
      "content": "He talks negatively about his past relationships. If a guy is a player, he’s probably hurt a lot of people in the past. In order to throw you off the scent, he may try to project his behavior onto them. He may act like he was victimized by them to gain sympathy and get closer to you. [4] X Research source If he does this repeatedly or about more than one person, start questioning whether the person engaging in bad behavior was actually him. Pay attention to how other girls in his orbit treat you. Players tend to have lots of girls around them, especially ones who seem angry at them. Warning Sign: He may trash talk his exes by calling them “psycho” or “crazy” and try to make you think that he was the victim and that the breakup was their fault."
    },
    {
      "title": "He flirts with other girls.",
      "content": "He flirts with other girls. A guy who is a player likely isn’t going to be satisfied with just your attention. Instead, he may seek affirmation from many girls and in many corners. Sometimes, he’ll even do this when he is with you. [5] X Research source He likes being in the spotlight and gets pleasure from female attention. He wants to “capture” as many girls as he can. A guy who’s genuinely interested in you won’t flirt with other girls around you, as you’re the one he’s got his eye on. Warning Sign: He will flirt with other girls by smiling, telling jokes, and initiating friendly conversation. If you confront him, he'll deny that he was flirting with other people."

    {
      "title": "He tries to get physical quickly.",
      "content": "He tries to get physical quickly. A guy who is a player is usually interested in physical contact with you right away. Since that’s often his central goal, he sees no reason to take it slow. He may be eager to cut to the chase and get what he’s really after. He may not bother to develop emotional intimacy because all he wants is physical intimacy. He'll likely go for it faster than a guy who's truly interested in developing a longer term relationship with you. Getting physically intimate with a guy quickly doesn't always mean he's a player, but if he doesn't seem interested in establishing a real connection with you, a physical relationship is likely all he's after.

      "title": "His actions don’t align with his words.",
      "content": "His actions don’t align with his words. A lot of people tend to focus on a boy’s words instead of paying attention to his actions. A player may act like it’s a chore to find time for you, but shower you with kind words when he’s around. His pretty words may be designed to flatter you by luring you into liking him. Focus on what he does, not just on what he says. A guy who's actually into you will be consistently communicative and emotionally available, and he will make regular plans to meet up. Alternatively, a player is more likely to text you (or even booty call) at the last minute, rather than commit to plans in advance. This is because he takes you for granted and doesn't want to be \"tied down\" by plans. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "His body language is overconfident and exaggerated.",
      "content": "His body language is overconfident and exaggerated. A player usually thinks he’s charming, and he plays it to the hilt. He’s a flirtatious, overly confident braggart. He thinks he’s all that, so he doesn’t try to pretend to be humble. He may put some extra oomph in his walk or make a lot of eye contact. For example: A player may swagger or strut when he walks. He will sometimes smirk, as if he has a hidden secret. A player will often touch other people a lot, but he'll avoid public displays of affection with you around other people. He'll only be affectionate in private. A player typically uses a lot of direct eye contact."

      "title": "He takes a suspiciously long time to respond to your calls and texts.",
      "content": "He takes a suspiciously long time to respond to your calls and texts. A player won’t be able to answer the phone right away all the time. There may be people he doesn’t want to know about you, and he might be with one of them at that time .Perhaps he’s with another girl. Perhaps he’s with guy friends. Perhaps he’s with family members. The key is that he doesn’t want them to know you’re calling. A genuine guy may not be available to answer the phone right away, but they’ll typically have a reason and make an effort to return your call or text when they’re able. Dating coach Courtney Quinlan says game playing is a sign that someone is a player. If they’re waiting hours to respond or are sketchy and evasive about their availability, that’s not a good sign. Warning Sign: He screens his calls. He'll call you back, but he won't answer the phone right away. Similarly, if he doesn’t answer his phone when you’re with him, there may be another girl that he doesn’t want you to know about. Warning Sign: The same goes for texting. If he takes forever to respond to a text, there could be a reason for it. He may be busy with someone else. He may also never let you see his texts."

      "title": "You tend to feel more impulsive around him.",
      "content": "You tend to feel more impulsive around him. Boys who are players will often try to trigger impulsiveness in you because it usually works out to their advantage. They may want you to violate your boundaries on physical intimacy fast, and may take various measures to make sure that happens. For example: He allows you to think that there’s an instant emotional connection, perhaps even saying that you're soulmates or sending you romantic songs. [8] X Research source He’s trying to get you to cross your boundaries so that he can get what he is after, which is physical intimacy. He'll lose interest in a girl who reasserts her boundaries, seems very cautious, and requires patience because he’s not really interested in a relationship."

      "title": "He gets annoyed when you make him wait to get physical.",
      "content": "He gets annoyed when you make him wait to get physical. One of the best ways to sort out whether a guy is a player or not is to make him wait a significant time before getting physically intimate with you. If he’s a player, he’ll likely get annoyed and may even try to press your boundaries to get what he wants, or dump you. [9] X Research source A guy who genuinely cares about you will respect your decision to get physical or to wait and won't pressure you into getting intimate before you're ready. Not every guy who gets physically intimate early in a relationship is automatically a \"player,\" and you don't need to wait to get intimate if you don't want to wait. Rather, consider his eagerness to get intimate alongside his other behaviors: if he seems genuinely interested in you, he's probably not a player. [10] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 283 wikiHow readers if they wait to be in an official relationship before having sex, 67% of them responded with yes . [Take Poll] So it’s completely fine for you to want to wait."

      "title": "He keeps you a secret.",
      "content": "He keeps you a secret. A player will typically try to keep you hidden from his friends or loved ones. Alternatively, he may try to downplay your relationship to others so that he can keep playing the field and pursuing other girls. [11] X Research source He may want to keep his options open with lots of girls, and if he tells people he has a girlfriend, other girls might stay away. It’s important to see whether he tells other people about you, and whether he downplays the state of the relationship to them if he does. Someone who’s genuinely interested in you will want to make you known to their friends and loved ones as your relationship progresses. Warning Sign: He may act differently in private vs. public. Does he say things to you that indicate you’re exclusive, but acts distant to you around other people? If so, he may be a player."

      "title": "His friends say that he has a pattern of avoiding commitment.",
      "content": "His friends say that he has a pattern of avoiding commitment. Other people around him, especially those who have known him longer, will have had time to see his patterns. How he acts, how he treats romantic interests, and whether he’s the type to commit are all things that his friends and loved ones could be keenly aware of. If his friends don’t think highly of him, they may have observed his bad behavior. Another bad sign is if his male friends are also known players. Is he still connected to his ex in a way that goes beyond being platonic? [12] X Research source Do girls seem desperate around him or angry with him? If so, he may have played them."

      "title": "He cares way too much about his appearance.",
      "content": "He cares way too much about his appearance. It’s good if a boy cares if he looks nice. Being well-groomed, smelling good, and having well-fitting clothes doesn’t necessarily mean he’s a player. But if he’s over the top with it and always shows himself off, there’s a greater chance that his intentions aren’t pure. For example, a player may spend a lot of time working out and might brag about and show off his muscles. He tends to put a high premium on physical appearance. This typically extends to how he dresses. He will likely be seen in nice clothes with flashy, expensive labels to show off. His car may also be flashy. There’s usually nothing subtle about this guy. He tends to use his body, his clothes, and his car to draw girls."

      "title": "His social media usage is suspicious.",
      "content": "His social media usage is suspicious. The way a guy presents himself on social media can give you a sense of whether he is a player or not. If he is a player, he will likely use social media to try to attract girls. If he doesn’t post you, refuses to show you his feed or direct messages, and tries to keep your presence unknown on his accounts, he may be playing you. [13] X Research source Check his relationship status on social media. Players may often pretend that they're single online or hide their status. Players often have lots of attractive girls on their friend list. Their comments will tend to be flirty in nature. A player's photos and videos on social media might be designed to showcase his physical attractiveness. He won't seem to mind or discourage flirting."

      "content": "They may be insecure and afraid to commit. Some players have low self-esteem that stems from a deep insecurity, which can make them afraid to commit. Rather than confront their inner feelings and work on building their self-esteem, they tend to keep people at arm’s length to avoid rejection.

This is called ludus love, which is Latin for “playful love.” People with this love style tend to treat relationships like a sport or a game. Some may even be pick-up artists, which are people who attempt to court women through pickup lines and tactics. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "In some cases, they may be narcissists. Narcissists tend to treat their relationships like transactions. They may pursue you then suddenly slow down, make promises they can’t keep, and lie so that you continue chasing after them. They tend to do this because they want to get closer to you without having to commit. [16] X Research source With a narcissist, the world revolves around them. They may say or do things that make you feel like they care, but it is in pursuit of their personal needs."

People with an avoidant attachment style tend to be afraid of getting intimate, which gets in the way of their ability to build meaningful relationships. They may dismiss you easily, have a hard time trusting you, and invest very little emotion into your relationship, which can make you feel like they’re playing games.

You may expect things to get serious, especially the more you get to know the player, but these expectations may set you up for disappointment.

Go to source For instance, if he flirts with other girls and it makes you uncomfortable, tell him, \"I won't go out with you if you're going to flirt with other people.\" But realize a player may not respect your boundaries, and it's important that you enforce them or he's likely to continue disregarding them. Remember, boundaries shift over the course of a relationship. If there’s something you were once comfortable with that you’d now rather avoid, and vice versa, let the person you’re with know."
