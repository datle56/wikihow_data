If the person you are concerned about is young, do research about their special interest(s) so that you can have a conversation with them about them. The main goal is to show that you care enough about the person to take their interests and recommendations seriously. Ask open questions that lead them to share their enthusiasm or interests openly with you. You can ask questions like: “How did you learn so much about (fill in the blank)?” “Can you tell me more about that?” “I love your personal style; how do you decide what to wear? Do you have any fashion advice for me?” “I watched the movie you recommended and really enjoyed it. Do you have any other recommendations?” “What is your favorite movie? Why is it your favorite?” “What hobby or activity could you spend your whole life doing?”"

If the person has health or transportation issues, offer to drive them somewhere or bring them a home cooked meal. Express interest in the person’s life or ask for advice dealing with a problem. You could ask questions like: “What was your life like when you were a teenager?” “What is your favorite memory?” “What is the biggest change you’ve seen in the world during your life?” “How would you support someone who is being bullied?” “How did you deal with being overwhelmed as a parent?”"

You may also be afraid that if you talk to someone about suicide, you will prompt them to act on their suicidal thoughts. These factors or others may lead you to hesitate to speak openly about suicide. However, you should fight this instinct because the opposite is actually true; speaking openly about suicide often prompts someone in crisis to think about and reconsider their choices. [10] X Research source . Preventing Suicide: A Global Perspective, by World Health Organization (2014) For example, during an anti-suicide project on a Native American Indian reservation with a high suicide rate, several eighth-graders admitted to actively planning suicides until they participated in open discussions about suicide. These open discussions violated cultural taboos, but they resulted in each of the participants choosing life and signing a pledge to avoid suicide."

It is easy to become frustrated when speaking to someone in crisis who isn’t thinking clearly, so remind yourself to remain calm and supportive. [11] X Research source The best way to be open is to not have any prepared responses for your loved one. Ask a few open questions like \"how are you feeling?\" or \"what is upsetting you\" and let them speak. Do not try to argue with them or convince them that things aren't really that bad."

Consider using a 3-prong conversation starter, which reinforces the relationship, explains what you have noticed, and shares that you care. Then ask about whether they have been having suicidal thoughts. For example, “Amy, you and I have been friends for 3 years. Lately, you’ve seemed depressed, and you’re drinking more. I’m very worried about you, and I’m worried that you may have been thinking about suicide.” For example, “Son, when you were born, I promised I’d always be here for you. You’re not eating or sleeping like you normally do, and I’ve heard you crying several times. I would do anything to not lose you. Are you thinking about killing yourself?” For example, “You’ve always been such a great role model. But you recently made a comment about hurting yourself. You are very special to me.
