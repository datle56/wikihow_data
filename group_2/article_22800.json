      "title": "Position your feet.",
      "content": "Position your feet. If you're standing, position your feet a comfortable distance apart. They should be slightly less than shoulder-width apart, with your left foot a bit in front of the right. Place your weight fairly evenly between your two feet. When moving while playing, you may shift the weight between your feet. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your chin on the chinrest.",
      "content": "Place your chin on the chinrest. Lower you head straight down until it touches the chin rest. This may feel slightly less natural, but you also shouldn’t be straining yourself too dramatically. Your chin should only drop, not stretch."

      "title": "Angle your head properly.",
      "content": "Angle your head properly. Now that your chin is on the chinrest, angle your head a little to the left so that you are looking 90 degrees from your violin. You want to angle your head in such a way that the chin rest runs along your jaw and ends at your chin."

      "content": "Pivot the violin toward the center. It should create a line that extends from your nose outward. [3] X Research source This is the correct way to hold a violin. If this is your first time holding a violin it might seem difficult, but get in the habit of doing it this way. Otherwise you will develop bad habits that will make it difficult to progress in the future."

      "title": "Keep the angle of the violin relatively steady while playing.",
      "content": "Keep the angle of the violin relatively steady while playing. When you play, the angle of the violin will fluctuate from left to right depending on the type of music and your comfort level. [4] X Research source However, the angle should not deviate too much more than 20 degrees. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the violin straight with the strings parallel to the ground.",
      "content": "Hold the violin straight with the strings parallel to the ground. The violin has a tendency to drop with bad posture, so check your posture if you notice the violin dropping constantly. To help with this, tie a rope from the ceiling and attach it to the scroll of the violin. Make sure that the rope is short enough that it is taut when the violin is in the proper position.

      "title": "Curl your forefinger onto the top of the neck.",
