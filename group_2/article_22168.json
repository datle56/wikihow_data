Ask your general practitioner for a referral to an OB/GYN. They will provide you with more specialized care, and be there at the birth of your baby. You can also ask friends for recommendations. Don’t feel like you have to go with the first doctor you meet. You can ask for consultations with more than one candidate. Choose the one who makes you feel comfortable and confident.

Frequent and consistent appointments with an OB/GYN, a family doctor or a certified midwife can ensure both your safety and your growing child’s safety throughout the pregnancy process. Begin prenatal care as soon as you know that you’re pregnant, when you decide you want to be, or when you suspect you might be. You can start by seeing your regular doctor, but will likely want to transfer to a specialized prenatal care doctor as your pregnancy progresses. So long as you are undergoing a normal pregnancy (according to your doctor), your scheduled prenatal appointments should follow this timeline: See your physician every 4 weeks until you are 28 weeks pregnant. See your physician every 2 weeks from the time you are 28 weeks to 36 weeks pregnant. See your physician once a week (or more often, as per your doctor’s instructions) after the 36th week of pregnancy. [2] X Research source"

However, keeping active while you are pregnant will ensure not only your health, but your baby’s as well. Regular exercise can make delivery less difficult, make losing your baby weight easier, aid in post-birth physical recovery, and encourage healthy fetal growth. Aim to do thirty minutes of low-impact exercise such as swimming, riding a bicycle, lifting weights, or yoga a day. Walking is a good option, too. Don’t participate in any high-impact exercises (long runs or HIIT workouts) or contact sports (soccer, rugby, football), as these put you at a high risk for injury. Overheating can be dangerous to your baby, so make sure you always keep cool by having a fan and cold water at the ready. [3] X Research source Make sure to talk to your doctor before changing your exercise routine or starting a new one. Staying active when you're pregnant will keep your joints and ligaments loose, which will make giving birth easier.

Aim for eight hours of sleep minimum a night, and try to snatch a mid-afternoon nap as well. Going to bed at a consistent time every night will also help to regulate your sleep schedule, making your sleep more restful and deep. Sleep on your left side, as this relieves pressure on your back. Other positions also risk cutting off the circulation to a major vein. Don’t take any sleeping pills while pregnant, unless prescribed and approved by your doctor."

Although a daily regimen of pills, supplements, and vitamins may be difficult to keep track of, it can be incredibly helpful in reducing the risk of a series of birth defects. To start, people should consume prenatal vitamins (advertised as such) in 600 micrograms per day after becoming pregnant. Prenatal vitamins contain a combination of high levels of folic acid and iron among other things, both of which are responsible for early development of the baby and reducing the risk of complications and defects such as spina bifida and premature birth.

Individual weight gain will be dependent on your weight and BMI prior to pregnancy. To determine your ideal weight gain, start by calculating your BMI. You and your doctor can do this together, and discuss your healthy weight. As a guideline, use your BMI and weight to interpret how much you should gain. Underweight women (BMI less than 18.5) should gain 28–40 pounds (13–18 kg). Women at a healthy weight (BMI between 18.5-24.9) should gain 25–35 pounds (11–16 kg). Overweight women (BMI between 25-29.9) should gain 15–25 pounds (6.8–11.3 kg). Obese women (BMI higher than 30) should gain 11–20 pounds (5.0–9.1 kg). [6] X Research source"

This is because your body is producing higher than normal levels of estrogen and progesterone, both of which (in high levels) can be responsible for causing gingivitis and gum disease, leading to bleeding, gum sensitivity, and swollen gums on a regular basis. You should try to visit your dentist every 3-4 months while pregnant to make sure you’re keeping a healthy mouth. In between visits, make sure that you brush and floss your teeth regularly.

These numbers will vary slightly depending on your starting weight before pregnancy, but will remain close to 300 calories. The calories you consume should be healthy calories—not those from junk food or fast food.
