      "title": "Apply for an address immediately after getting permission to build.",
      "content": "Apply for an address immediately after getting permission to build. You may not be given an address immediately after you get the necessary zoning and building permits, but in some countries and states, you can. To see if you qualify for an address before building begins, contact your local city’s government and request to be directed to the appropriate government body. You may be put in touch with your municipal postmaster, the planning and zoning department, or the state government where you live. You will need the land deed in order to apply for a new address. You may be told that you have to wait until the building’s entrances are constructed. If this is the case, simply wait until the frame of your building is up to apply. This is common because local governments like to know where an entrance is visually located before assigning it a number. You’ll likely need to wait for the address to be approved before you can register a business there. Depending on where you live, you may be able to temporarily register your business out of your home. Otherwise, you may need to use a virtual address service ."

      "title": "Compile the documents needed to prove you own a building.",
      "content": "Compile the documents needed to prove you own a building. You’ll need the land deed, multiple forms of identification, contractor receipts, approved architectural plans, and anything containing information regarding your property. Include any forms that list the geographic location of your building (especially if it lists the longitude and latitude). Make high-quality copies of all of the necessary documents to prove that the building exists and you own it so that you don’t risk losing the originals. Usually, only the property owner can actually apply for a street address. You cannot apply on behalf of someone else. To register your business out of the property, submit your approved business license to the local, state, and federal government along with your land deed or mortgage proving you that the address is legally yours."

      "title": "Fill out an application and mail copies of your documents.",
      "content": "Fill out an application and mail copies of your documents. In some states and countries, you simply mail copies of your documents with a letter explaining you want a street address. In others, you’ll need to fill out an application alongside the copies of your documents. In either case, complete the necessary letter or application and mail your documents to the necessary government office. There is usually a fee for this service. It’s often somewhere between $50-500 depending on where you live and what kind of building you’re registering. Hire a courier service or bike messenger if you really want to make sure that your documents end up in the right hands."

      "content": "Comply with the site visit to get your new address confirmed. Your local or state government will process your application and either accept it, request more information, or schedule their site visit. For the site visit, a government surveyor will simply show up, inspect your building, and make sure that all of your information checks out. If all goes well with the site visit, you can expect your address to be approved within a week or two. In some states and countries, you will simply receive a letter informing you that your requested address has been approved and added to the official database where you live. Once your business license is approved for a location, you’ll have a second site visit completed by a business inspector to ensure that the building is up to code for the specific type of business that you’re operating."

      "content": "Get a PO box as an alternative to a mailing address. A PO box is essentially a mailbox that you rent at the post office. Once you pay for one, you’ll be able to receive mail and packages at the PO box address like it’s a home address. However, you cannot use a PO box as your official personal address, so it can’t go on your driver’s license and you can’t use it to for tax purposes. [1] X Research source PO is simply short for “Post Office.” If you’re running a business or public service and want people to be able to mail you things, a PO box is a good option if you don’t have a storefront and don’t want to publish your personal address. You can normally operate an LLC under a PO box address. Depending on where you live, you probably can’t register a business out of a PO box though."

Private shipping centers, like UPS or MBE, often offer PO boxes as well. Go to the post office or shipping center that is most convenient for you and ask the clerk about opening a new PO box. [2] X Research source Only one person can apply for a PO box, so if you’re opening a PO box for a business, have the primary owner of the business apply.

Fill out the necessary forms and pay the necessary fees to submit your application. [3] X Research source PO boxes come in different sizes, ranging usually from 3 by 5.5 in (7.6 by 14.0 cm) to 12 by 22.52 in (30.5 by 57.2 cm). Smaller boxes can hold 10-20 envelopes, while larger boxes can hold small packages and dozens of letters. Choose a size based on your anticipated needs. [4] X Research source Larger PO boxes cost more money to rent than smaller boxes. You can usually pay up to a year in advance for a PO box. The cost of renting a PO box is usually between $10-25 a month. You do need to have a primary address if you live in the United States."

The service will give you a verified address that you can ship to and receive packages from. You may need to use a third-party service to get a virtual address to get a vendor to ship goods overseas or to temporarily register your business at a verifiable address. [5] X Research source This is a great option if you’re traveling a lot and need a temporary address to collect your mail. Essentially, your new address is a warehouse operated by the virtual address company. You can have goods shipped to that address, which will be forwarded to your real address. You can also send mail to the address to be forwarded to somewhere else. This is a good option for freelancers that are legally required to register their income source from an address other than their home."
