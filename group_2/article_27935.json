Stir the rice around with your hands, then drain it through a fine mesh strainer. Repeat the process until the water you drain away is clear and not cloudy anymore. [1] X Research source Rinsing rice removes all the starch from the outside and makes it less sticky. When the water runs clear, it means you have washed away all the starch."

[2] X Research source Use whole milk for the richest, creamiest texture. Use 2% or low-fat milk if you want a less-caloric option. For a non-dairy version, you can use coconut milk or almond milk."

      "content": "Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Turn the heat down to low so the mixture is just simmering. Put a lid on the pot to cover it. [4] X Research source Make sure that the rice and milk are simmering gently while covered. If the mixture starts to boil, decrease the heat further so the milk doesn’t get absorbed too fast. If you use more than three cups of water, you may need to let it simmer for a while."

      "content": "Simmer the mixture over low heat for about 20-25 minutes, stirring twice. Continue to let the rice and milk cook until it has thickened but there is still creamy liquid visible. Stir the pot after the first 10 minutes and after 18 minutes to mix the rice and milk together and check the consistency. [5] X Research source"

Remove the pot from the stove and in 1-2 tbsp (12-24 g) of sugar or 1-2 tbsp (15-30 mL) of another sweetener like honey or maple syrup. Stir in 1/4 tsp (1 g) of salt, taste the rice pudding, then add more sweetener if you desire. Mix in any other spices or other flavoring ingredients at this stage as well. [6] X Research source You can even sweeten it with a little brown or palm sugar. The other ingredients you add at this point are completely up to you. Add small amounts, stirring and tasting as you go, until you are happy with the flavor.

Cover it with an equal amount of the milk of your choice. [8] X Research source For example, if you have 1 cup (195 g) of cooked rice, combine it with 1 cup (236 mL) of milk. Make sure that you only use unflavored cooked rice for this. You can use short-grain, long-grain, white or brown rice. Whole milk will give the rice pudding the richest flavor. However, you can use 2% or low-fat milk if you prefer. Avoid using skim milk as it is too watery. If you want a non-dairy option, try using coconut milk or almond milk."

Turn the burner on to medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. [9] X Research source Stay right in front of the mixture stirring it until it comes to a boil. Milk boils over very easily, so if you take your eye off the pot for a minute or two, you might end up with a mess on your hands!"
