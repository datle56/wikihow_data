Warm compresses can encourage blood flow to your piercing and heal your infection when used interchangeably with cold compresses. If warm compresses cause swelling, stop using them. For inflammation, apply a cold compress for at least 20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Once your piercing is no longer inflamed, alternate between hot and cold compresses every 10 minutes for as long as desired. [10] X Research source Use a saline solution instead of water in warm compresses. Dampen a towel or cloth with the solution and warm it in a microwave for 30 seconds. Make sure it's not too hot before you put it on your piercing so you don't burn yourself."

Your doctor can prescribe antibiotics, advise additional treatment, or identify a potential allergy. Serious infections can happen quickly, so you must seek medical attention right away if your piercing isn't healing. A piercing should never cause serious pain.
