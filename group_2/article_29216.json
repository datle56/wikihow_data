Use the pulse setting on your blender for a few seconds until the ice cream is smooth like soft-serve. Scrape any ice cream from the sides of the blender with a rubber spatula. [1] X Research source You can use whatever flavor ice cream you want. For example, if you want to make a brownie Blizzard, use chocolate ice cream to give it a richer flavor.
