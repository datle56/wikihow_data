Take a deep breath and take things slowly. If you accidentally drop the tampon on the floor, throw that one away and start with a new one.

Then, slowly and gently slide the applicator inside until your fingers are resting at your vaginal opening. If you feel any pain or discomfort, stop and adjust the angle of the applicator. When you've got it right, you likely won't feel much of anything.

The applicator is the largest thing you'll be putting in your vagina. If you've got it angled properly, you shouldn't feel any pain. But if it's still uncomfortable, you might try a smaller tampon size. If you just started your period, you might also wait until your flow is heavier to start using a tampon (if you have the option!). It's usually more comfortable to insert a tampon when your vagina is a little more lubricated. [6] X Research source"

[9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Applicator: Some tampons don't have applicators, but for your first time, you'll probably find applicators more comfortable and easier to work with. Type of applicator: Applicators are either plastic or cardboard. The plastic applicators have rounded edges, so they're usually more comfortable. Absorbency: Choose the lowest absorbency that works for your flow. Light absorbency tampons are usually the smallest. Start with light and regular.

If you see any spotting in your underwear or there's blood on the toilet paper when you wipe, that's a sure sign that it needs to be changed. [11] X Research source Look at the string as well. If you can see blood or staining on the string, you probably want to take the old tampon out and put in a new one.

[13] X Research source If you feel a little resistance, try to relax a little. It might be that the tampon is still pretty dry, which will make it more difficult to pull out. Keep your touch light. If you pull too hard, too fast, you could end up with splatter everywhere (especially if you have a heavier flow)."

If you're going to be in a situation where you won't be able to go to the bathroom to change your tampon at least once every 4 hours, it's probably better to just wear a pad. There is a risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), a bacterial infection. It's rare , but it's still worth worrying about because it can be fatal. To minimize your risk of developing TSS, use the lowest absorbency you can and never leave your tampon in for more than 8 hours."

The durable string runs through the entire tampon—it's not just attached to the end. That makes it very difficult for it to just break off. If the string does break, don't panic. Coat your fingers in a lubricant (the kind people use for sex) and you should be able to reach in and grab the tampon. Worst case scenario, tell a trusted adult or call your doctor to help you."
