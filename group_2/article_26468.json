      "content": "Devise a diet plan. The most important first step in shedding pounds through dieting is to select a dieting plan. Tailor that plan to your lifestyle, and establish clear weight loss goals. It is essential to construct a plan that is appropriate for your goals and medical/health history. This is best done by a dietitian. There are many different ways to achieve weight loss through dieting. Below, a few different diet plans are listed. Keep in mind that, whichever dieting method you choose, dietary and medical specialists suggest that losing more than an average of one to two lbs. a week is not safe for your body. Also, some studies suggest that rapid loss increases the risk of gaining weight back. In order to lose one to two pounds per week, average adults need to cut 500 to 1,000 calories per day from their diet. [1] X Research source Low or No Carb Diets: These diets utilize a method of eliminating carbohydrates from your diet and replacing the nutritional value of those carbohydrates with protein-rich foods. These diets, while helpful with losing weight, can lead to nutritional deficiencies, as carbohydrates are a natural part of human health requirements. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Low-Fat Diets: These diets are designed to cut the overall intake of fats from your diet, thus eliminating excess calories that can lead to weight gain. Also, decreasing fat intake lowers the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.

These types of diets can often lead to fatigue, as an individual’s overall caloric intake and, thus, energy is reduced.

Eating breakfast, contrary to popular belief, actually helps to kick-start your metabolism, which assists in burning excess calories throughout the day. [7] X Research source Start off the day with a 500 to 600 calorie meal. A very healthy and filling meal at that falls in line with this calorie intake would include a banana, a bowl of oatmeal, whole-grain toast with one to two tablespoons of peanut butter. This will provide you with a mix of carbohydrates and protein. Carbohydrates give you quick energy and protein will provide energy throughout the day. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source"

Don’t overindulge and avoid following-up dinner with a dessert. You should eat a dinner that falls somewhere around 400 to 600 calories. Roasted chicken with whole wheat pasta, mahi-mahi tacos, beef stir fry with broccoli and shiitake mushrooms, or pork medallions with pomegranate sauce are all tasty choices that provide the necessary nutrition while still falling in this calorie range.

All of the \"unhealthy\" snacks, or those that contain high levels of “empty” calories or high levels of fat, are deemed excess calories by your metabolism and stored for later use. Also, soda and alcohol, especially beer, are high in calories and generally unnecessary for your body’s nutritional requirements. [13] X Research source As an alternative, try snacking on a handful of almonds, carrot sticks and hummus, calorie-limited snack packs, or yogurt. [14] X Research source It is critical to point out here that diet sodas have never been proven as effective as weight loss tools. Actually, the sweetness of the diet soda tricks your body into thinking it is getting high-calorie input, without providing any actual calories. Because of this, drinking diet soda is likely to increase hunger as well as the desire for sweet, high-calorie foods. [15] X Research source"
