Speech coach Patrick Muñoz reminds us to have open body language: make eye contact , stand up straight, and push your shoulders back a bit before relaxing them. [2] X Expert Source Patrick Muñoz Voice & Speech Coach Expert Interview. 8 June 2023. Orient your body so that you’re facing the other person, but angled just slightly away, to show that you’re engaged but not too intense. Avoid crossing your arms, putting your hands in your pockets, and slumping your shoulders, which read as defensive or nervous postures. Stay a comfortable distance away, like about 1–3 ft (0.30–0.91 m) to show you’re attentive without crowding them. Also, put your phone away so you're engaged and not distracted."

      "content": "Aim to make a connection with the person you're talking to. Pay close attention to what the other person is saying. If they say something you find relatable, or that reminds you of your own experience, opinion, or anecdote, offer a comment after the other person finishes their current train of thought. For example: Them : “I went to this huge concert over the weekend. It was so much fun, but I felt a little claustrophobic with all those people there.” You “Oh, nice! I can’t remember the last time I went to a concert. I should check and see if anyone I like is coming to town.” ' Or : “I’m terrible with crowded spaces, too. I’d so much rather be somewhere I can hear myself think. I’m glad it was fun, though!” Them : \"I'm just here to read for fun. I can't believe I've gone this long without reading The Catcher in the Rye. \" You : \"I love that book! Some people think it's overrated, but I completely disagree.\" Or : “Oh man, I really wanted to love that book, but I just couldn’t stand the protagonist.”"

[3] X Research source If the other person says anything particularly interesting, or which piques your curiosity, make a mental note, then ask them for more information once they’ve finished their train of thought. Avoid yes-or-no questions, and try to balance your ratio of comments to questions, so that you’re not making the conversation too one-sided. For example: Them : \"I couldn't go to that party, but I did go to her Cinco de Mayo party last month. That party was crazy.\" You : \"It really was! I knew you looked familiar. How do you know Ashley? Isn't she great?\" Them : \"I don't mind the rain so much, but it made it hard for me to walk my dog! That was so annoying.\" You : \"You have a dog too? I have a little poodle named Stella. Do you have a picture of your dog?\""

Instead, stick to everyday things, like weather, mild news, upcoming events, and the like. This is also just a matter of etiquette. If you’re talking to a close friend, these are probably normal topics. But with strangers, asking about these things can be a little invasive. A little griping is okay! People love to commiserate. Just make sure it’s not too serious, and don’t make it the entire conversation."

      "content": "Find some common ground, and reveal something about yourself. While asking questions, jump on any subject the other person brings up that you also have experience with. Horseback riding, travel destinations, obscure music artists—as long as it’s lighthearted and forms a connection it’s fair game. Tell them about your own experience, but keep it casual—we’re not confessing our darkest secrets here. For example: [5] X Research source \"Oh, you’re taking that creative writing class? I took it last year! Professor Hoffer is hilarious.\" \"We met briefly at Damien's housewarming party, right? Isn't his art collection amazing?” \"Can you believe all of this rain?

To do so, ask questions that are still related to the conversation, but which are a little more personal. [6] X Research source It often helps to offer something personal yourself. For example: “Oh, I went to Paris last year! I was visiting an old friend who works on a vineyard. What do you think of the culture over there?” “So is marine biology something you see yourself doing for a long time? It must be a challenging field…” “That reminds me of my Dad growing up!

When things slow down, take a deep breath, look around, and think of your next question. [7] X Research source Don’t worry about feeling awkward! It’s totally normal, and the more attention you draw to it, the more awkward it actually becomes."

[10] X Research source These are things you both have in common, just by existing together alongside them. For example: “I wonder what they’re building at that construction site.
