The five food groups are fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, grains, and dairy. Select fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, blueberries, apples, broccoli, spinach, and potatoes. Children aged 9-13 need about 34 grams of protein each day. [2] X Research source Lean animal-based proteins like chicken, fish, and eggs are good options to help you grow, as are plant-based proteins like soy, tofu, chickpeas, and lentils.

[6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Talk to your parents about doing the plan together so that you can get healthy meals at home and when you're at school. Write a specific plan for each meal every day. For example: “Monday: whole wheat toast with peanut butter, cup of strawberries in Greek yogurt, and glass of orange juice for breakfast; apple slices for a mid-morning snack; turkey sandwich, cut veggies and dip, and glass of milk for lunch; string cheese and crackers for afternoon snack; chicken breast, steamed vegetables, and salad for dinner; cup of blueberries and raspberries for dessert.” Consider packing your lunch on days that school food isn't as healthy as you would like. For example, you might pack a salad or a sandwich on pizza day. Eating healthy doesn’t mean never enjoying the foods you love! If you eat pizza now and again, it’s unlikely to affect your growth, so don’t worry too much about it. Get your parents involved in your meal plans. This might include writing the plan together, cooking with your parents, or helping them grocery shop."

Drink the recommended amount every day. Children between the ages of 9 and 13 need about 5 to 6 cups (1.2 to 1.4 liters) of water a day. Children between 14 and 18 need about 6 to 8 cups (1.4 to 1.9 liters). [7] X Research source If you are physically active or it is very hot outside, you may need to drink more. Eating nutritious food like fruits and vegetables can add 2-3 cups of water towards your daily total."

However, don’t feel like you can’t eat your favorite foods even if they’re “unhealthy”; just don’t eat them every day.

Ask your friends to do activities that move your whole body instead of sitting around the house: play tag together, or go on a walk around your neighborhood.

[26] X Research source Even if your folks are short, you may have tall relatives that you don't know. You may end up taller than you expected—or even taller than the rest of your family! Ask your parents and grandparents if they know how tall your ancestors were. You can also ask your siblings and parents when they grew. This can give you an idea of when you might have a growth spurt. Remember that you have other awesome things about you other than your height.

Your doctor may be able to reassure you that just being patient is all you need to do. Puberty affects growth and can happen at different times for different people. Your doctor can also show you what percentile you fall into compared to your peers of the same age for height. Together, you can then use this information to discuss potential issues.
