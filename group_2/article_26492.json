      "content": "Choose fibrous proteins instead of fatty ones. Protein is important for organ function and building muscle. Select lean cuts of beef or extra-lean ground beef when you're consuming red meat. Remove skin from chicken before cooking. Skip the fatty deli meats like bologna and salami. Choose lean turkey or roast beef as a replacement. Vegetarians can get plenty of protein from soy, nuts, beans, and seeds. Lentils, legumes, and beans are excellent sources of fiber and protein. Eat low-fat dairy for a source of protein, including low-fat cheeses and nonfat yogurt. A 150-gram serving of Greek yogurt provides about 11 grams of protein. The study has shown that 20 women who were eating high-protein yogurt snacks instead of crackers, chocolate, and other low-protein snacks consumed fewer calories and experienced less hunger.

Fruits and vegetables contain fiber to help you feel full quickly. Try some of these tips to introduce more fruit and vegetables into your diet: Eat what is in season and eat fruit and vegetables for snacks or, for dessert. When you eat apples in the fall, for instance, or cherries in late summer, it might as well be an indulgent dessert. Cut up celery, carrots, peppers, broccoli or cauliflower and dip them in a light salad dressing or hummus. Use vegetables as a main dish. For example, make a stir-fry or a hearty salad and add just a few ounces of cooked chicken, salmon or almonds."

Combined with the right combination of proteins and vegetables, whole grains are perfect all-around nutrition. Simple carbs are things like white bread, processed flour, and white sugar. This gives you energy quickly but then comes with a crash. It turns into fat very quickly. Substitute whole wheat flour or oat flour into pancakes or baked goods. You might need to add additional leavening ingredients, like baking powder or yeast. Put barley in your soup instead of rice or try a pilaf with barley, wild rice or brown rice. Eat only naturally-occurring carbohydrates instead of processed carbohydrates. Avoid processed foods, like white bread, semolina pasta or crackers, or processed sweets like candy bars or sugary vegetables.

      "content": "Cut the salt from your diet. Eating more sodium causes your body to retain water, which can cause you to feel bloated and gain more weight. The good news is that you'll sweat that weight out very quickly, so an easy way of cutting some pounds is to eat less sodium in your diet. Instead of salt, try spicing your meals with chili flakes, fresh salsa, or cajun spices and seasonings. Unsalted foods will taste much saltier eventually if you cut salt out for a while and let your taste buds re-acclimate."

[5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This indicates that eating three meals and two snacks may be a healthy eating pattern for weight loss. Make sure that you don't get hungry by eating small portions throughout the day at regular intervals. Between your meals, eat a 150-calorie snack to keep your metabolism burning and to stave off hunger. Be sure that you don't eat a fattening snack such as sweets or crisps.

Eating smaller portions can also help you to keep eating some of your favorite foods while still losing weight. For example, before loading up your plate with half a frozen pizza, check the label to see what a portion size is and only put this amount on your plate. Or, if you want to have a bowl of cereal, check the box to see how much you can have for one serving and use a measuring cup to get the exact amount. Controlling portions doesn't have to mean you're hungry all the time if you try strategies to make yourself feel more full."

So force yourself to write down the good, the bad and the ugly. Keep these tips in mind: Be complete. Write it all down, including beverages, condiments, and a description of how the food was prepared. Don't pretend you didn't have that extra glass of wine after dinner. If it goes into your stomach, it goes into the journal. Be accurate. Record your portion sizes in your food diary. Don't eat too little or too much - keep track. Also, read the ingredients list so that you can be accurate about serving sizes. Be consistent. Carry your food journal everywhere that you go.

The more aware you are of the calories in the food you eat, the more easily you'll be able to eat the right amount of food and do the right amount of exercise to drop a couple of pounds. Take your food journal and look up each item individually. Keep a running tally and add up your calorie total for the day. Next, look up how much a person of your age, height, weight, and energy level needs per day in calories. Add about 170 calories to your total.

Buy the right healthy ingredients to eat the way you want to eat, and plan it out by the calorie. Be realistic. If you like to eat out a lot, don't try to totally eliminate eating out. Instead, plan on eating home-cooked meals six days a week. Cut down on the snacking, or try to make them healthy snacks. Fresh vegetables with guacamole, unsalted almonds, or fruit make for great weight-loss snacks. Let yourself have non-food treats. Promise yourself that if you can follow this for six weeks and exercise (if that is one of your goals), you will treat yourself to a pedicure or a massage. Work indulgence foods into your calorie plan. If you do want to have something that is a little higher in calories, then make sure that you work it into your overall calorie goal for the day. For example, if you are following a 1,800 calorie plan, and you want to have a brownie that is 300 calories, then you would only have 1,500 calories left for the day."

      "content": "Eat fewer calories than you burn. The only surefire way to lose weight is to eat less than you burn over the course of a day. Sounds simple, but it takes work and consistency. That means exercise. If you want to lose weight and stay healthy, you need to start exercising. Aim for 15-30 minutes of exercise 3-5 times a week to get started. [8] X Expert Source Pouya Shafipour, MD, MS Board Certified Family Medicine Specialist Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. Try to tally your energy-output each day. It's helpful to keep track of these with pedometers, or other weight-loss tracking apps that you can use to make this easier. Read the section about exercise for more specific tips. Set mini-goals. Your ultimate goal might be to lose 20 pounds, but instead of focusing on that, think that you want to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.45 to 0.91 kg) this week. Or you can focus on non-pound goals like skipping after-dinner snacks this week or only drinking alcohol on weekends. It is important to understand that weight is entirely a function of input and output. The input is the food you eat and the calories contained therein. The output is your energy output. To lose weight the output needs to be greater than the input. It is that simple. Do not believe any of the diet fads. If you are currently not gaining or losing weight then just burning 300 extra calories per week or eating/drinking 300 calories less per week (2 sodas for example or a small burger) WILL make you lose weight - in this case around 5 pounds of fat per year."

Exercise large muscle groups to burn more calories and lose weight, instead of focusing on specific muscles. Try some of these examples: Start with squats paired with an overhead dumbbell press to work your lower body and upper body at the same time. Perform resistance exercises while sitting or reclining on an exercise ball. You'll strengthen your core while simultaneously working on other areas. Use machines and free weights. These tools tend to focus on particular muscle groups like the arms, shoulders, thighs, glutes and upper back. Do these more focused exercises after you work on exercises for multiple muscle groups. Rest at least one full day between strength training workouts so that your muscles can recover. Recovery will help you to avoid pain and injury."

If you don't like competitive sports, try doing something that you can do by yourself. Swim, or play golf, or go hiking instead of playing a game with a ball and a net. Get a bicycle if you want to find a great way to get around and exercise at the same time. Don't spend all that time sitting down in your car when you could be burning calories. Also, try going on a walk after dinner for 40 minutes-1 hour. During this time, your body goes into fat-burning mode until you eat in the morning. Make sure to do this after dinner, because eating anything but protein will take you out of the fat-burning mode and make sure to eat a good breakfast."
