      "title": "Select the color of your clothing based on your needs.",
      "content": "Select the color of your clothing based on your needs. Some colors show sweat stains more rapidly than others, such as gray or light colors. Other colors are more forgiving and do a better job of hiding the stains, such as navy blue and black. Surprisingly enough, some shades of white can hide sweat, while others show it up––this requires some at-home experimentation. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Layer bright colors over your neutrals.",
      "content": "Layer bright colors over your neutrals. If you want to wear colors, think about choosing jackets and sweaters in the brighter colors or your choice. Unfortunately, bright colors are some of the worst for showing sweat stains. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear material that is better at coping with sweat.",
      "content": "Wear material that is better at coping with sweat. Stay away from synthetic fibers like rayon and polyester. Choose natural materials like cotton or linen instead. These fabrics will help your skin breathe in a way that synthetics can’t. There are even new fabrics being developed that completely wick away sweat. Figure out what works best for you.

      "title": "Put on an undershirt.",
      "content": "Put on an undershirt. This might just make you sweat more, but many men find that an undershirt (particularly under dress shirts) is a good option. This allows your outer shirt to stay dry, while the undershirt will catch the sweat. Make sure your overshirt is big enough that the sweat does not transfer from the inner to the outer shirt.

      "title": "Find loose fitting clothes that allow your skin to breathe and air to circulate.",
      "content": "Find loose fitting clothes that allow your skin to breathe and air to circulate. Choose shirts that are cut lower under the armpits so that your skin and the shirt touch less. Different brands and cuts fit differently, so do some experimenting."

    {
      "title": "Wear a jacket, cardigan, or shrug.",
      "content": "Wear a jacket, cardigan, or shrug. These will cover the underarm area that you are worried about. Even though the extra layer might make you warmer, wear a lighter shirt underneath so that the combination of the two garments is not too hot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Experiment with sleeveless shirts and dresses.",
      "content": "Experiment with sleeveless shirts and dresses. Tank tops and sleeveless clothing reduce the amount of fabric near the armpit that might get sweaty. Without that fabric, air also circulates in the armpit, cooling your skin and preventing as much sweat from forming. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase dress shields or garment pads (they are called both) to use in your clothing.",
      "content": "Purchase dress shields or garment pads (they are called both) to use in your clothing. Some are absorbent pads that stick to your clothing. Others are shields that can even be sewn into your shirts at the seam to prevent stains. The final model uses a strap to go around your shoulder and arm, keeping the pad in place directly under your armpit. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make your own underarm pads.",
      "content": "Make your own underarm pads. Buy some panty liners at the store to place in the armpits of your shirt. Cut each one in half. With your shirt on, expose the adhesive and stick it to the inside of the armpit of your shirt. Repeat on the other side. Finally, make sure the pads don’t show. Experiment with thickness to see if you need more protection."

    {
      "title": "Use antiperspirant.",
      "content": "Use antiperspirant. Sometimes all it takes is looking for a stronger antiperspirant to stop the sweat stains. Make sure that whatever you use (roll-on, spray) doesn’t irritate your skin. Apply your antiperspirant at night before going to bed to give your body time to absorb the anti-sweat ingredients."

      "title": "Consult your doctor if you are sweating so much it seems unhealthy.",
      "content": "Consult your doctor if you are sweating so much it seems unhealthy. He or she might suggest prescription antiperspirant. Another option might even be botox injections to prevent underarm sweat. Make sure you take into account the possible side effects of botox, and only do it if suggested by your medical professional.
