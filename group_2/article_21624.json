    {
      "title": "Preparation",
      "content": "Preparation As the name implies, hand-tossed pizza is made by tossing pizza dough up in the air with your hands. The tossing thins out the dough, which is then cooked on a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. On the other hand, pan pizza dough is simply spread out and baked in a circular pan or skillet. [1] X Research source Hand-tossed pizza is often called New York-style pizza. Other names for pan pizza include deep-dish and Chicago-style pizza."

    {
      "title": "Crust",
      "content": "Crust Hand-tossed pizza has a thinner, crunchier crust than pan pizza. When dough is tossed in the air, it loses air bubbles. This means it doesn’t rise as much, coming out of the oven thin and crispy. Pan pizza dough rises a lot because its air bubbles stay intact. So, its crust comes out of the oven thick and chewy. [2] X Research source Pan pizza dough is covered in oil, so its crust is often crispy, as if it’s been fried. While the crust on hand-tossed pizza is also crispy, it’s more on the dry side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Texture",
      "content": "Texture Hand-tossed pizza dough is soft, while pan pizza dough is bread-like and fluffy. The act of tossing and rotating the dough kneads and softens it. So, when it comes out of the oven, it’s thin and easy to chew. Because pan pizza dough is denser and full of air bubbles, it’s more bread-like. It’s spongier and fluffier in texture, which means it also takes longer to chew! [3] X Research source Pan pizza dough is often compared to focaccia bread, which is also spongy and dense."
    },
    {
      "title": "Toppings",
      "content": "Toppings Pan pizzas can typically hold more toppings than hand-tossed pizza. Because pan pizza dough is thicker, it’s usually loaded up with sauce, several different cheeses, veggies, and meats. You’ll usually find fewer toppings, especially less cheese, on hand-tossed pizza. This is because the thinner crust can’t withstand as much weight. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Taste",
      "content": "Taste While they use most of the same ingredients, pan pizzas tend to taste cheesier and oilier than hand-tossed pizzas. Pan pizzas are super hearty, stuffed full of cheese and baked in olive oil for a crispy, flaky crust. Hand-tossed pizzas are usually on the lighter and drier side because they don’t use as much oil and cheese. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Temperature",
      "content": "Temperature Pan pizza is usually baked at a higher temperature than hand-tossed pizza. Most hand-tossed pizzas are cooked at around 500° F (260° C) for 10 to 15 minutes, giving them their signature crunchy crust. Because pan pizza dough is thicker, it usually bakes at 550° F (287° C). It needs about 15 minutes or more in the oven to come out golden and crispy."

      "title": "Eating method",
      "content": "Eating method The best way to eat pan pizza is with a fork and knife, while hand-tossed is eaten with your hands. The thick crust, mile-high toppings, and melty cheese makes it difficult to eat pan pizza with your hands. So, most people cut it up. You can certainly eat hand-tossed pizza with a fork and knife, but it’s easier to eat it with your hands. Simply hold it flat or fold it in half, which is perfect for when you’re on the go. [6] X Research source However, there’s no right or wrong way to eat pizza ! Pizza is meant to be enjoyed however you like."

Move your hands around the perimeter of the dough, pressing and spreading your hands into it as you go. This creates the crust and thins the dough out. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Swing the dough up and out from your chest and towards your face. Hold your hands tight against your chest, twisting your body towards your non-dominant side. Then, quickly extend and swing your arms over to the other side of your chest. At the same time, push your arms up so you’re bringing the dough level with your face. [10] X Research source Essentially, you’re swinging the dough across your body while pushing it upwards. This creates a rotation which thins your pizza as it spins in the air."

Then, fist both of your hands. When the dough starts to drop, extend your arms forward to catch it. [11] X Research source If you tear your dough when you catch it, don’t worry! Just take a small piece from the crust and spread it over the tear."

Brush olive oil on top of your dough and add on your favorite pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese. Then, layer on any other toppings that you like. If you’re cooking your pizza on a stone or slab, set your pizza on it before adding your toppings. When it comes to pizza, the toppings are truly endless! Veggies like green peppers, olives, onions, and jalapeños add a great crunch, while meats like pepperoni, ham, and chicken pack lots of yummy flavor."
