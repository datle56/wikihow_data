      "content": "Jello theory explains how airplanes resist turbulence. The term comes from a viral 2022 TikTok video posted by user @anna..paull. In the jello theory analogy, the air you’re flying in is like a cup of jello, while the airplane is like a small, balled-up piece of a napkin suspended in the jello. You can shake the jello, but the napkin ball doesn’t sink—it just wiggles. That’s because air pressure on all sides (or jello, in the analogy) keeps the object suspended. [1] X Research source TikToker Anna Paul claims a pilot told her about jello theory to ease her fear of flying. When you’re scared of turbulence, use jello theory to reduce your fear by imagining that the plane you’re in is encased in jello. The plane may shake, but it won’t fall out of the sky because it’s suspended by pressure."

      "content": "The inventor of the Gelatin Exercise is pilot Tom Bunn, L.C.S.W. Bunn included the analogy in his program, SOAR Fear of Flying, and his book about reducing fear of flying. His version of the analogy uses a cube of pineapple instead of a folded-up napkin inside the jello, but otherwise, the principles are the same. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Turbulence is caused by shifts in airflow.",
      "content": "Turbulence is caused by shifts in airflow. While flying, the atmosphere may suddenly create air currents that shake the plane, which manifests as turbulence. During turbulence, passengers are typically instructed to remain seated to avoid injury from these unexpected jolts. Turbulence won’t force a plane out of the sky because the plane is suspended within a pocket of air pressure. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Do a grounding exercise during your flight. There are several exercises recommended for people dealing with feelings of nervousness and anxiety. One is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique where you intentionally notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. [4] X Research source Another technique is box breathing (inhaling for a count of 4, holding for a count of 4, exhaling for a count of 4, holding for a count of 4, and repeating) a form of yogic deep breathing.

      "content": "Bring distractions on the plane. Pack a novel, tablet, or coloring book in your carry-on bag or purse. Reading, watching a show or film, or drawing will help distract you—even during turbulence. When your mind is otherwise occupied, you may be less likely to feel flight anxiety. [6] X Research source"

Once you’re familiar with the science behind how a massive plane can be suspended in the sky (it’s a combination of lift, thrust, drag, and gravity), you’ll likely feel better about getting on one to fly. Watch YouTube videos and read simple explanations for the mechanics of flight and the statistics of accidents or crashes, which are rare. [7] X Research source"
