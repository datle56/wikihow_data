      "title": "Combine 1 tbsp (15 mL) of Borax with 1 cup (237 mL) of water.",
      "content": "Combine 1 tbsp (15 mL) of Borax with 1 cup (237 mL) of water. Borax acts as a slime activator, causing the glue and other ingredients to stick together and form a spongy goo. A stronger activator, like this one, will help the slime thicken. If you don’t have Borax, try using contact lens solution (one that contains boric acid) as a substitute. Simply use 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of contact solution in the slime instead of the Borax and water mixture. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pour ½ cup (119 mL) of school glue into a new mixing bowl.",
      "content": "Pour ½ cup (119 mL) of school glue into a new mixing bowl. Glue acts as the slime’s base, and although school glue isn’t thick, your strong activator will cause it to thicken later. Opt for a classic white glue for a milky color or a clear glue for clear, transparent slime. [2] X Research source Try using a colored or glitter school glue to make your slime even more fun."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add ½ cup (119 mL) of water to the mixing bowl.",
      "content": "Add ½ cup (119 mL) of water to the mixing bowl. When making this type of thick slime, always use a 1:1 ratio of glue and water. This will create the perfect moldable and stretchable texture. [3] X Research source Not adding enough water could cause the slime to crumble and become cakey, while adding too much could cause it to thin out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze food coloring into the mixture to change its color.",
      "content": "Squeeze food coloring into the mixture to change its color. If you used a clear or white school glue, consider adding food coloring to turn it a different color. Start with one drop and add more until you get your desired color. [4] X Research source Think about adding other mix-ins like glitter or miniature styrofoam balls to add more texture to your thick slime."

      "title": "Mix the ingredients together until everything is combined.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients together until everything is combined. Use a spatula, spoon, or craft stick to ensure that everything is mixed together thoroughly before moving on to the next step. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Add the Borax solution a teaspoon (5 mL) at a time.",
      "content": "Add the Borax solution a teaspoon (5 mL) at a time. Put a splash of your premade activator into your slime mixture. Use your mixing utensil to stir it in completely. The consistency of your slime will start to change as the activator reacts with the other ingredients—clumping together and moving away from the bowl. The more activator you use, the thicker your slime will be. [6] X Research source Try not to add too much activator to your slime, as this can cause your slime to become stiff and break. If this happens to you, simply mix in some extra glue. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Knead the slime until it takes on your desired thickness. Now comes the fun part! Dump out your slime mixture and squish, squeeze, pull, and fold it until it begins to take shape. The longer you work your slime, the stronger it’ll become. [8] X Research source Store your slime in an airtight container or ziplock bag for up to 2 weeks. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour 1 cup (237 mL) of Glue-All into a mixing bowl. Glue-All is the perfect base for your thick and glossy slime because it clumps together when combined and activated with other ingredients. [10] X Research source School glue could be used as a substitute, but the texture may not be as thick or moldable. If you’d like extra glossy slime, use ½ cup (119 mL) of Glue-All and ½ cup (119 mL) of clear glue . [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add about 2 tbsp (15 mL) of lotion to the glue.",
      "content": "Add about 2 tbsp (15 mL) of lotion to the glue. The lotion acts as a softener and helps the slime stretch. Roughly 2 pumps or squeezes of the lotion will be enough. [12] X Research source Try using a scented lotion to make your slime even more soothing. Consider the color of your lotion before adding it, as the color may affect the color of your slime."

      "content": "Add around 2 tbsp (15 mL) of hair conditioner into the mixture. Like lotion, conditioner adds a soft, smooth texture to your slime while keeping it nice and thick. Only 2 to 4 pumps or squirts are needed. [14] X Research source Consider using a scented conditioner that matches your lotion's scent."

      "content": "Mix all the ingredients until everything’s well combined. Use a spatula, craft stick, or plastic spoon to bring everything together. It’s better to over-mix your slime at this stage than to under-mix it! Make sure all the ingredients are mixed evenly, as this will help the activator adhere to the mixture. [15] X Research source Try adding a few drops of food coloring to your mixture for even more fun."

Mix together 1 tsp (5 mL) of Borax in 1 cup (237 mL) of warm water in a separate container or bowl until all the Borax is dissolved. Then, pour the Borax activator into your slime mixture in 1 tsp (5 mL) increments until your slime reaches the desired consistency. The mixture will clump up and become stringy, but the more you stir, the more solid it’ll become. Be patient, and don’t be afraid to use your hands! [16] X Research source The more activator you add, the denser your slime will be. You may use all of the activator or you may not use much at all, and that’s okay!"
