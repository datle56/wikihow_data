      "title": "Lavender",
      "content": "Lavender Lavender is the perfect combination of two of Libra’s other power colors, pink and light blue.

And, like light blue, lavender promotes tranquility and calm, which goes along nicely with Libra’s personality.

    {
      "title": "Red",
      "content": "Red Libras feel best in calm, tranquil environments, and they tend to go with the flow, rather than asserting themselves. The intense, bold energy of bright red tends to be pretty out of alignment with Libra’s easygoing vibe, so it’s best to avoid this vibrant hue. [10] X Research source This goes for super very bright or neon colors, in general. They tend to overwhelm Libras, who prefer calmer, less saturated tones. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Orange",
      "content": "Orange Orange symbolizes optimism, enthusiasm, and unbridled energy. [12] X Research source Although these traits can be positives, they tend to be at odds with Libra’s low-key, go-with-the-flow energy. Libras seek out harmony and equilibrium in all things, and they never want to rock the boat. With this in mind, the chaotic energy of orange can be a bit off-putting and destabilizing for them."

    {
      "title": "Brown",
      "content": "Brown Brown tones are associated with earthy, grounding energy. [13] X Research source Air sign Libra, on the other hand, hates to be “grounded” or tied down to anything. Their opinions, desires, and even their personalities can change with the wind, and they need to feel free to explore the various facets of themselves to be happy. [14] X Research source As a result, brown and other neutral hues are not the best choices for Libras."

    {
      "title": "Black",
      "content": "Black The color black is associated with protection, power, and authority, which are definitely positives. [15] X Research source Libras, however, tend be a bit indecisive and hesitant to take the lead, preferring instead to let others make the important calls. [16] X Research source As a result, the intense, authoritative energy of black can be a bit overwhelming and out of alignment for them."
