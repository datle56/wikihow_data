The last player with cards is the “Idiot.” Players can discard cards on each turn by playing a card that is of the same or higher value than the most recently discarded card. If they can’t play, they must pick up the discard pile or “burn” it by playing a specialty card. [1] X Research source Number of Players: 2-4 players Ages: 10+ Difficulty: Easy Length of Play: 20-30 minutes Required Materials: Standard 52-card playing deck with the Jokers removed, and a silly hat (optional)"

      "title": "How to deal",
      "content": "How to deal Deal each player three cards face down. Deal an additional card face up on top of each of these three cards. Each player should have three separate piles in front of them. Finally, deal each player three more cards outside of their piles—thee cards will make up each player’s initial hand. [2] X Research source Card Values: Aces are always high in the Idiot card game. Players can decide whether they want face cards to be worth the same as 10s or to have increasing value (i.e. Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13). Before the game begins, players can exchange the cards in their hands with the faceup cards in front of them. Because the piles will be the last cards each player has to use before finishing the game, it’s helpful to load them with high-ranking cards like 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, or Aces. Having high cards at the end of the game will help avoid having to pick up the discard pile and end up with the most cards Once all players have traded the cards they choose to, all remaining cards are placed in the center as a draw pile.

      "content": "Starting the game The player to the dealer’s left takes the starting turn. Because cards are played in ascending order and 2 is a specialty card that resets the pile, gameplay starts with a 3. If the first player has a 3, they may play it into a discard pile then draw back up to have three cards in their hand. [4] X Research source If the starting player doesn’t have a 3 (or chooses not to play it), play continues to the next player. If that player has a 3, they may play it. If play continues around the table and no 3s are played, this process is repeated with 4s, then 5s, and so on until the first card is played."

    {
      "title": "Taking a turn",
      "content": "Taking a turn On each turn, a player must play a card that’s equal to or higher than the card on top of the discard pile. If a player isn’t able to or chooses not to play a card, they must pick up all cards in the discard pile. [5] X Research source If a player has multiple cards of the same value in their hand, they can choose to play them all at the same time. When a player discards a card, they must draw another card from the deck. Players should always have at least three cards in their hand unless the draw pile is empty. If the card drawn at the end of the turn has the same value as the card(s) that were just played, the player can play that card immediately and draw a new one. Example turn: The card on top of the discard pile is a 7, and the player has two 9s in their hand. The player chooses to play both 9s, then draws a third 9 from the draw pile. They play that 9 before drawing a new card to complete their hand and end their turn."

      "content": "Continuing to play Play continues with players taking turns around the table until there are no cards in the draw pile. Once the draw pile is depleted and a player has no cards left in their hands, they can start using the three card piles in front of them. The three face-up cards must be played first. [6] X Research source If the last card in a player’s hand matches a faceup card in one of their piles, they can play both cards in one turn. Just like the cards played straight from each player’s hands, the face-up cards can only be played if they are equal to or greater than the card on top of the discard pile. Once a player has played all of their face-up cards, they can play their last three facedown cards. The facedown cards are played blind. If a card is played and it doesn’t meet the criteria (i.e., being greater than or equal to the most recently played card), that player must pick up the entire discard pile. All the discarded cards must then be played out before continuing on from the piles."

On their turn, a player can discard a 2 and an additional card that they want to change the new discard number to. [8] X Research source For example, a player may discard a 2 followed by a 6. The next player now has to play a 6 or higher. The 2 card in Idiot is similar to the Wild card in UNO—but instead of that player choosing a new color for the discard pile, they get to choose a new number."

For example, if a player discards a 5 on top of three other consecutive 5s, the discard pile is burned."
