If your loom has an anchor peg, place it on a peg that's closest to the anchor. [1] X Research source If your loom doesn't have an anchor peg, you'll just need to keep track of where you started the row. Place the slip knot on any of the pegs."

      "title": "Wrap the yarn counter-clockwise if you're knitting clockwise.",
      "content": "Wrap the yarn counter-clockwise if you're knitting clockwise. Use your right hand to pull the working yarn towards the center of the loom. Then wrap the yarn counter-clockwise around the peg that's next to it going in a clockwise motion. Keep wrapping the yarn around each peg until you've gone around the loom. Work clockwise if it's more comfortable for you. [2] X Research source The lines of yarn should be closest to the inside of the loom if you've wrapped the pegs correctly. If your pattern calls for making knit stitches first, wrap another row of yarn around each peg so you have 2 levels of yarn on the pegs."

      "title": "Wrap the yarn clockwise if you're knitting counter-clockwise.",
      "content": "Wrap the yarn clockwise if you're knitting counter-clockwise. If you prefer to knit counter-clockwise around the loom, wrap the yarn around each peg in a clockwise motion. Continue in the clockwise motion around each peg until you've gone around the loom. The line of yarn should be nearest to the inside of the loom and you'll end up with 2 distinct lines on each peg. If you're knitting the first row, wrap the yarn around each peg of the loom 1 more time so you have 2 levels of yarn on each peg."

      "content": "Use knit and purl stitches to work a loom project. Once you've established your foundation row, you can wrap the loops around the loom again in order to make knit stitches. You can also begin wrapping and lifting stitches in order to make purl stitches. Follow pattern instructions to craft your own projects using a combination of these stitches. If you're just learning, consider choosing a project that only uses knit stitches. Then you can begin adding purl stitches once you're comfortable with working on a loom."

      "content": "Insert a loom hook into the lower loop. Take a loom hook and insert the tip under the bottom loop of a peg. The hooked portion of the hook should catch on the yarn so it doesn't slip off. [3] X Research source If you're concerned that your working yarn will come loose, wrap it around the anchor peg to secure it while you knit."

Now you can take away the loom hook to use on the next peg. [4] X Research source Avoid pulling the stitches too tightly or it will be difficult to bring the bottom loops over the top loops."

If you're making a row of knit stitches, wrap the yarn around each peg as you did when you cast on the foundation row and work the stitches. If you'll be making purl stitches, you don't need to wrap another row. Keep track of how many rows you've made, especially if you don't have an anchor peg to use as a reference."

Instead, bring the working yarn in front of the loom away from the center. Hold the yarn below the loop on the peg you're ready to work.

Then take the loop you just made and push it onto the peg. It should now be the only loop on the peg and you can bring the working yarn down below the next peg to make another purl stitch.
