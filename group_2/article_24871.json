      "content": "Add salt to your food and cooking. Another easy way to add extra sodium to your diet is to sprinkle more salt on your meals and use more salt when you cook. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ask your doctor or a dietitian for advice about how much more salt to add to your diet. 1 teaspoon (6 g) of table salt contains about 2300-2500 mg of sodium. Sprinkle your meals with a little salt and use it while you're cooking. When using prepared sauces, marinades, canned foods, and other cooking ingredients, do not choose low-sodium or low-salt options. For example, use salted butter instead of unsalted butter."

      "content": "Avoid caffeine and alcohol. These categories of fluids may worsen low sodium levels. Both can cause electrolyte imbalances and also act as a mild diuretic (a substance that causes you to expel more water and salt from your body). [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Caffeinated drinks to avoid include coffee, tea, and energy drinks. Avoid bottled juices or sports drinks that promise an “increase in energy” as they might also contain caffeine. Although it's usually okay to consume alcohol occasionally, avoid it completely if you are suffering from low sodium levels and are having difficulty managing them."

      "title": "Restrict your water intake.",
      "content": "Restrict your water intake. Cutting back on the amount of water and other clear fluids you consume can help manage your sodium levels. Too much water can dilute the sodium levels in your blood and make them more difficult to manage. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re concerned about how much water you’re drinking, get advice from your doctor. Although water is crucial to your health, don’t overconsume it. In general, your thirst should guide you to an appropriate amount of fluid. If you're not thirsty, you're most likely consuming an adequate amount of fluid. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Also take note of your urine color. If your urine is pale yellow and you're using the bathroom between 4-6 times daily, you're most likely consuming adequate fluids daily. Reducing your water intake will help your body naturally raise its ratio of sodium to water. This may be easier and more effective than sodium replacement."

If you’re exercising hard or working in the heat, grab a sports drink instead of regular water when you need to rehydrate. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even low calorie or diet sports drinks contain extra sodium and other helpful electrolytes. Sports drinks are also a great way to replenish temporarily reduced sodium levels when you’re dehydrated from throwing up or having diarrhea."

Ask your doctor to recommend one, or make your own with household ingredients. [10] X Research source Commercially available ORS, such as Pedialyte or Ultima, can be bought over the counter. They may come in the form of ready-to-drink liquids or powders that are meant to be diluted in water. Follow the package directions for proper use. Or, make your own ORS at home by dissolving 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar and ¾ teaspoons (4.25 g) of salt in 1 US quart (0.95 L) of water. Mix in a little powdered drink mix (such as Crystal Light) or juice to improve the flavor. Coconut water is also a good ORS substitute as it contains natural electrolytes to help manage fluid balance. [11] X Research source"

Taking anti-nausea medicine may help stop the excessive loss of fluid due to vomiting. [12] X Research source When you vomit, you expel most of the contents of your stomach, including water, sodium, and other electrolytes. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you are vomiting excessively, such as during the stomach flu or other bacterial or viral illnesses, you may lose so much water and sodium that your sodium levels drop dangerously low. In addition to anti-nausea medications, consider managing nausea and vomiting naturally. Ginger tea, ginger soda, and more small, frequent meals can help reduce nausea and vomiting. Always talk to your doctor prior to taking any over-the-counter medications. They may also be able to prescribe anti-nausea medications if over-the-counter options don’t work for you."

Taking an over-the-counter medication to help lessen or stop diarrhea can help you manage low sodium levels. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Diarrhea causes your body to flush out a large amount of fluids. Your gut doesn't have the time to absorb the needed minerals, including sodium. If your doctor recommends it, take antidiarrheal medications to stop diarrhea and allow your body time to reestablish your sodium levels. In addition to medication, there are some natural ways to manage diarrhea. Try eating bland, low-fiber foods like bananas, white rice, and toast. Also avoid high-fiber foods and dairy, as these can make diarrhea worse. Consult with your doctor prior to taking any over-the-counter medications."
