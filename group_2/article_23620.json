      "title": "Start off with the “easy pose.”",
      "content": "Start off with the “easy pose.” Sit on one or two folded blankets with your legs stretched in front of you. Bring your legs in and sit cross-legged, and make sure your knees aren’t at a level any higher than your hips (sitting on the blankets will help with this). Don’t let your chest sink down: hold your chest out and pull your shoulders back. [1] X Research source Hold this pose for several minutes, and feel the stretch working through your quads, hips, and lower back. Alternate the pose: switch up which shin is crossed in front of the other. It might seem too simple to just sit crossed-legged, but this pose is an excellent way to get your stretching routine started."

      "content": "Do the butterfly stretch. While sitting, bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together. Drop your knees as far to the floor as possible. Don’t force your knees, but open where your thighs and hips meet and allow these two joints to work together toward the floor. Bring your heels in toward your pelvis as far as is comfortable. [2] X Research source Keep stretching for 30 seconds, continuing to breathe as you do so. As in the easy pose, lengthen your chest and keep the shoulders back. Use your breathing to control the stretch. Feel the stretch work through your inner and upper thighs, hamstrings, buttocks, and lower back."

      "title": "Reach for your toes.",
      "content": "Reach for your toes. Sit on the floor with your legs together in front of you. If possible, keep the back of your knees to the floor. Inhale, and flex your feet by drawing your toes toward your torso. Exhale, and reach for your toes with your hands, keeping your back and core straight. Sit against a wall with a towel rolled between the wall and your lower back if you need support."

      "title": "Do the short bridge stretch.",
      "content": "Do the short bridge stretch. Lay on your back with your arms flat by your sides, knees bent, and your feet flat on the floor shoulder distance apart. Inhale slowly; as you exhale, lift your buttocks by pressing your arms and feet into the floor, tucking your sternum to your chin as you lift. Your buttocks and thighs should be parallel to the floor, and your knees should be directly over your heels and bent at a 90 degree angle. [3] X Research source The short bridge is a great beginner flexibility exercise that stretches the lower back and quads, and strengthens the buttocks and hamstrings. [4] X Research source Hold the pose for 5 seconds as you slowly exhale, then inhale as you come back to the floor. Keep breathing slowly and hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute if you’re able. Use a yoga mat if you have one, and place a rolled up towel under your neck if it makes you more comfortable. Avoid this pose if you have recently injured your back or neck, unless your doctor, physical therapist, or chiropractor recommends it."

      "title": "Stretch your quads while standing.",
      "content": "Stretch your quads while standing. Stand with your legs in line with your shoulders. Keep your back straight and bend your knee to lift your shin and foot behind you. Reach back and hold the toe of the leg you’re lifting to extend the stretch further. Hold the stretch for 5 to 10 seconds, depending on your ability. [5] X Research source Use your hand on the same side as the leg you’re lifting: if you’re lifting your left leg, use your left hand. Brace yourself by holding your opposite hand against a wall if you need help balancing. Repeat on the other side, and proceed to 5 to 10 repetitions for each leg."

      "title": "Try a kneeling bridge stretch.",
      "content": "Try a kneeling bridge stretch. Kneel down and sit on your heels. Reach behind you and place your hands on the ground with your arms fully extended. Inhale, then place your weight on your hands and exhale as you tighten your buttocks and lift your pelvis forward off of your heels. [6] X Research source Hold the pose for 3 to 5 seconds, depending on your ability, then return to the seated position. Proceed with at least 10 repetitions. The farther back you reach, the more intense your stretch. Start with your hands closer to your feet if you're a beginner."

      "title": "Do lunge stretches.",
      "content": "Do lunge stretches. Start on one knee with your other leg forward, so that knee is bent above the heel at a 90 degree angle. Bring both hands to your forward thigh, and lean your torso backward while extending that knee forward. Use these opposite motions to stretch out your quad. [7] X Research source Hold for thirty seconds. Proceed with 5 to 10 repetitions on each leg. Work the stretch even more by sliding the foot that's flat on the ground slightly outward and bringing both hands to the floor. Your arms and hands should be on the inner side of your leg and your knee should be in line with your shoulder. Bend your elbows, bringing them closer to your chest as you lower your torso closer to the floor. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Do the standing calf stretch. Stand facing a wall with your arms extended and hands held flat against the wall. Your legs should be shoulder distance apart, with one leg extended behind you and feet flat on the floor. Bend your forward knee and lean toward the wall while keeping your back straight, feeling the stretch work through the calves and hamstrings of your back, extended knee. Hold this pose for 30 seconds to a minute, and repeat on the other leg. Proceed with 5 to 10 repetitions for each leg."

      "content": "Do the downward dog. Get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders with your knees bent under your hips and held apart at shoulder distance. Spread your fingers apart for wide support and walk your hands slightly forward. Bring your hips up toward the ceiling as you tighten your core muscles. Try to keep your heels close to or on the ground, and feel the stretch work through your calves as you keep your knees straight. Hold the pose for thirty seconds to a minute, or longer if you’re able to do so. Proceed with 5 to 10 repetitions. Try bending one knee at a time while keeping your toes in place to extend the stretch through your hamstrings."

      "title": "Try the “heavy leg” pose.",
      "content": "Try the “heavy leg” pose. Start by laying on your back with your buttocks facing a wall. Tuck yourself as close to the wall as you can, and bring your legs straight up against the wall. Keep them as straight as possible, so your torso on the floor and your legs against the wall form a 90 degree angle. Flex your feet by stretching your toes toward your torso, and feel the stretch work through the backs of your legs. [9] X Research source Try to hold the pose for 2 to 3 minutes. If you have an elastic strap, try looping it over your feet and hold each end in your hands to increase the stretch."
