      "content": "Stand with your right foot behind your left foot. Keep your thighs close together and your torso relaxed. [2] X Research source A big part of this move is appearing to fall backward. Try to look like you're leaning backwards while actually keeping your center of gravity in your hips. The reject is considered the standard jerkin' move. A major aspect of jerkin' is to display as much frenetic energy as possible. Your legs should never stop moving. Instead, do the reject while getting into the groove and figuring out what moves to do next."

      "content": "Jump backwards onto your left foot and simultaneously slide your right foot forward. When your left foot is flat on the ground, your right foot should be in the air, toes up. Make it look like you're running backwards without moving from your spot."

      "content": "Repeat by stepping backwards onto your right foot. Slide your left foot forward with your toes in the air. Keep repeating with each foot. Go as quickly as you can to make it look like you are running backwards in place. Do whatever you want with your arms. Some dancers keep theirs up or swinging in opposite time with their legs.

      "title": "Hop forward onto your right leg.",
      "content": "Hop forward onto your right leg. Your right leg and upper body should be straight. While hopping, bend your left leg at the knee so that your left calf is perpendicular to the rest of your body. Your left leg's toes should be pointing down. This version of the reject is more high energy and requires better balance than the first version. While jerkin', you can switch it up between the two to add some variety to your dance."

    {
      "title": "Switch legs.",
      "content": "Switch legs. Your left foot should now be on the ground behind you and your right leg in front with toes pointing up. Then jump forward with your left foot directly under your body and bring your right foot back. Now your right foot's toes should be facing the ground."

      "title": "Repeat hopping twice on each foot.",
      "content": "Repeat hopping twice on each foot. Do these moves fast enough and it should look like you're skipping backwards. Just keep hopping the pattern: Right foot on the ground, left leg bent back with toes down. Left foot back on the ground, right foot forward in the air with toes up. Left foot forward on the ground, right leg bent back with toes down. Right foot back on the ground, left foot forward in the air with toes up. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Stand straight on your left leg and cross your right foot behind your left knee.",
      "content": "Stand straight on your left leg and cross your right foot behind your left knee. Your legs should look like a number 4. This is a move that requires a lot of flexibility and strength. Do not attempt the pin drop if you are new to dance or are prone to ankle sprains. Many jerk dancers do multiple pin drops in quick succession between periods of doing the reject. The more pin drops you do at once, the more difficult it becomes to right yourself as you get dizzier. A dance with a lot of quick pin drops in a row is very impressive."

      "title": "Bend your left knee and drop towards your left side.",
      "content": "Bend your left knee and drop towards your left side. Control your fall so you don't go too fast. Remember that your aim is to appear to fall while actually lowering yourself to the ground with your leg muscles. Getting this step right takes a lot of practice."
