      "content": "Consider your farming background and geographic location. It’s critical to start with a business plan for your farm. The planning process will help you address most of the issues you’ll encounter in your business. Your experience in the farming industry has a big impact on your plan, along with the types of crops grown in your area of the country. [1] X Research source Evaluate your level of expertise as a farmer. If you’re new to farming, you may be able to find grants that pay for training and mentoring programs. Think about your available resources. Do you have access to enough land to farm? Consider what equipment you’ll need and how many people it will take to operate your farm. Take a look at the types of crops grown in your area of the country. You may be able to apply for grants that support organic farming, or specialty crop farming (fruits, vegetables, tree nuts). Analyze whether or not your area can support these types of farming."

      "content": "Write a business plan . A comprehensive business plan will show a potential grantor that you should be considered for a grant. Your plan should include a discussion of how you will market and sell your crop. The plan should also explain how you will generate a profit and manage cash. Compute the initial costs you’ll incur to open your farm for operation, if you’re starting from scratch. If your farm is already in operation, explain why you need financing. In both instances, you’re explaining how you will use the grant proceeds. You may use the grant proceeds to purchase land, seeds, or new equipment. Your grant proposal may include your need for more labor, or improved housing for your labor force. The business plan should include a projection of the income you’re going to generate and the expenses you will incur each year. A good business plan will also include projections of cash inflows and outflows. Most business plans include at least three years of business projections. You may need to change your plan to meet the requirements of the grant application. Every grant, however, will require you to create a business plan in some form."

      "content": "Decide which components of your plan may qualify your farm for a particular grant. Once you get your plan on paper, read through it. You may find a facet of your plan that relates to a specific grant. If you can connect your business plan to the purpose of the grant, you can make a compelling case to be awarded the grant. Say, for example, that you manage a profitable farm. You have more available land to farm, but you need capital (money) to hire more workers and expand production. You may be able to find a grant that exists to help disadvantaged workers find jobs. Assume that you have expertise in organic farming, but you don’t have the capital to expand your operation. There are grant programs specifically designed to help the organic farmer produce more crops. That type of grant may be a great fit for you."

For example, many government farm grants are only provided to those farms that qualify as a “small farm.” A small farm is typically defined as those farms bringing in gross receipts of less than $250,000 annually. Some of the main types of government grants include: [2] X Research source Farm labor grants, which can be used to locate, hire and pay farm employees. New farmer grants, which are used to help those looking to start operating a new farm. Environmental quality incentive grants, which are provided to those farmers who agree to employ environmentally friendly farming processes in exchange for grant money."
