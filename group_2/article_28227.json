Vector images are best with simple images that have relatively few colors. Converting your image into a drawing or painting image will make it easier to turn into a vector image. The way you do this will vary depending on the type of image you want to create. The following are a few filters you can try and use: Oil Paint: The Oil Paint filter will give your image a soft painting look. You can find the Oil Paint filter in the Stylize menu. Pallette Knife: The Pallette Knife filter simulates paint applied with a pallette knife. This creates sharp, textured edges and strokes. It's in the Artistic menu. [1] X Research source Dry Brush: The Dry Brush filter reduces the amount of color in areas that have a common color. This can reduce the amount of detail needed to convert areas to paths when converting the image to a vector. It's in the Artistic menu. Poster Edges: The Poster Edges filter will add some dark, thick lines to your image. It's in the Artistic menu. Surface Blur: The Surface Blur filter makes textures appear smoother. This reduces the amount of detail in the image. It's in the Blur menu. Unsharp Mask: The Unsharp Mask filter will increase the sharpness and boost the details. It's in the Sharpen menu."
