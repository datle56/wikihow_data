      "content": "Select the correct Formica or other laminate for your project. Most places that sell laminate will provide sample chips for you to take home and compare to the house's color scheme. Take several of these home and test for additional properties to help you decide. [1] X Research source Also keep in mind that you can purchase formed laminate to fit your counter if you do not wish to do the sawing yourself. A matte finish will hide wear and tear better than a glossy laminate, which is easily scratched, but may require more cleaning. Laminates come in a whole spectrum from the most glossy to the most matte, so consider each chip by its appearance, and not its marketing. Test how well the laminate stands up to wear and tear by scratching it with a steak knife. If you're applying a thin laminate sheet, use 1/16\" (0.16 cm) thick laminate for flat work surfaces and 1/32\" (0.3 cm) sheets for vertical surfaces. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the Formica on a flat, stable surface.",
      "content": "Place the Formica on a flat, stable surface. This should be large enough to keep the Formica steady while cutting. Use scrap plywood or similar material that you don't mind damaging with the saw. Don't cut on concrete or another surface that will damage the saw blade."

    {
      "title": "Apply masking tape along the lines.",
      "content": "Apply masking tape along the lines. This makes it easier to see where to cut, while also reducing the risk of chips. You can also apply additional tape to the surface beneath the formica to protect it, but you shouldn't cut over a surface you want to keep presentable."

    {
      "title": "Cut the Formica along straight lines",
      "content": "Cut the Formica along straight lines . Ideally, you should use a circular saw, saber saw, back saw, table saw, or laminate shears. A handsaw with at least 10 teeth per inch (4 per cm) will also work, but may be tedious for larger jobs. [5] X Research source Use a metal straightedge to ensure a straight cut. If you don't have a saw, use a craft utility knife with a laminate cutting blade to score the laminate sheet, and then snap it on the scoring by lifting the smaller piece until it snaps. Use a straightedge to keep your score straight. Lift carefully and keep an eye on the score to make sure the laminate bends at the desired break point. Do not use these tools to make circular cuts. Cut out the laminate piece in straight lines, taking care not to cut into the marked area."

      "content": "Use a different tool to make curved adjustments (if applicable). If your installation place is curved, you'll need to use a jigsaw or laminate router to make these finer adjustments. The cutting tool you used earlier will have trouble turning along a curve, resulting in laminate that won't fit."

      "content": "Apply contact cement to the edge strip and the surface it will attach to (if applicable). If you are installing laminate on a countertop or other surface with edges, begin with the edge pieces. If you cut them from the laminate yourself, apply the contact cement with a brush or roller to both surfaces. Allow it to set until it feels tacky, according to the manufacturer's directions. If you are using pre-glued end caps , all you need to do is heat a clothes iron, place the laminate against the edge, and iron back and forth. Let sit for one minute and gently tap it along its length with a rubber mallet or shoe heel. You can now skip to Trim the edge strip."

      "content": "Align the surface carefully using dowels. Place lengths of 1/4-inch thick (.64 cm) or larger dowels every 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) apart across the surface to prevent accidental misalignment. These should lay flat across the full width of the surface to hold the laminate up until it is aligned. When applying laminate to vertical surfaces, you will need to position them by hand."

      "content": "Before installing, scribe your countertop to adjust it if it won't fit. If your walls are not at right angles, place your countertop against the wall as closely as you can, then use a compass and sander to adjust the shape: [6] X Research source Check that the countertop is level using a plumb bob or level. Slide shims or wedges beneath the countertop to make it level if necessary. Hold the non-pencil end of the compass against the wall at the widest gap, and touch the pencil end against the countertop. Move the compass along the length of the wall to draw a line on your counter. Clamp the countertop onto a sawhorse or other secure position, then use a sander or block plane to level the countertop up to the pencil line. Your countertop should now fit snugly against the wall."

      "title": "Install angled edges of Formica using miter bolts and sealant.",
      "content": "Install angled edges of Formica using miter bolts and sealant. For L-shaped countertops, Formica typically comes precut with angles of either 45ยบ or 22.5ยบ. Attach these diagonal pieces together with miter bolts after aligning their front edge. Apply a bead of sealant or laminate caulk to ensure a waterproof corner. Do not over tighten the miter bolts. Only tighten enough to keep the pieces in place. Tap down one piece of laminate with a rubber mallet or shoe heel if the surface is not level across the diagonal."

      "content": "Consider whether to install a laminate backsplash. A backsplash is a vertical section of material above the countertop, which protects the wall from stains and other kitchen accidents. If your wall is drywall, you'll need to attach a particle board base before adhering the laminate. You could also consider installing a tile backsplash over your laminate counter."
