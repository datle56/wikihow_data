These are convenient but relatively expensive. Buy the ingredients and make it yourself. Buy staple ingredients instead of pre-made meals. You will be able to make much more food for much less money, for instance, by buying a bag of uncooked rice than by purchasing microwaveable rice bags. If you eat large portions, cutting down a little can save you money. Try to save part of the meal for later. Freeze leftovers if you won't eat them right away. Try new flavors and spices. A fish fillet or chicken breast can become a more exciting dish with a novel sauce or seasoning. Try a spice you are unfamiliar with, or a condiment from an Asian, African, or farmer's market in your area."
