      "content": "Check for an HDMI port on the cable box. Most cable boxes have HDMI ports, which makes them easy to connect to your smart TV's HDMI port. [1] X Research source An HDMI port is usually labeled \"HDMI\" (but not always) and has 6 sides—one long side on the top, a shorter side on the bottom, and left and right sides that are angled inward. If your set top box has an HDMI port, you can use a standard HDMI cable to connect it to your smart TV. If you have an older cable box and just upgraded to a smart TV, contact your cable provider to see if they offer HD-compatible boxes."

You have several options: [2] X Research source If the box has composite RCA (yellow, white, and red) ports, you can connect it to your TV using an RCA-to-HDMI adapter. While you won't get high definition, you can still watch cable this way at a lower quality. [3] X Research source If the box has component (red, blue, and green) ports, you can connect it to your smart TV's component ports for HD resolution. If your TV doesn't have component ports, you can use a component-to-HDMI adapter and still get HD (as high as 1080p) resolution."

Plug the coaxial cable into the wall, and the other end into the \"Cable In\" (or similar) port in your set top box. If you have both cable internet service and cable television , you probably have a coaxial splitter—an adapter that allows you to connect both a cable modem and a cable box to the wall at the same time. [4] X Research source Plug a coaxial cable into the available port on the splitter, and the other end into your cable box. Don't turn on the cable box yet."

As long as you subscribe to their cable service, you can use their app to watch channels on TVs that aren't connected directly to the cable box. If your provider has an app, install it from your smart TV's app store to get cable on the TV.

These inputs are round with a hollow center and typically labeled \"Cable in,\" \"Antenna In,\" or \"DTV/TV.\" [8] X Research source Even if your TV does have a coaxial input, your cable TV provider may not provide channels without a set top cable box. Contact your cable provider to find out if you can access cable without a box. To connect a coaxial cable to the TV: Turn off the TV: Run a coaxial cable from the wall jack to the TV's input. Turn on your smart TV. Use the smart TV remote control to switch to the \"TV\" input. You may have to go into your TV's settings to find the \"Tuner mode\" section and switch it to \"Cable.\" Then, you'll need to scan for channels to see what's on."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source To ensure the box works with digital cable, get a converter box with a built-in QAM tuner rather than an \"over the air\" tuner. Most of these converter boxes double as DVRs, which allow you to record your favorite shows."
