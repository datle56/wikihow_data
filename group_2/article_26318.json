      "content": "Decide how to wear your shirt. You may not have much choice on what shirt to wear, but there are a few decisions you can make: If your school allows it, leaving your shirt untucked can be more comfortable and casual. If your school requires tucked shirts, pulling it up to leave a little loose fabric can stand out. (This trick is usually used for boys' uniforms.) Try cuffing your sleeves to stand out a little. Consider undoing the top buttons of a polo shirt. Check the dress code first; many schools have strict regulations for girls."

      "title": "Add another top.",
      "content": "Add another top. Most schools allow a dress shirt or camisole underneath your school uniform. This adds class and may allow you to undo the top buttons of your uniform for style and comfort. If you prefer a more covered look, buy a uniform sweater (cardigan) instead. If your school doesn't have uniform sweaters, check the dress code to see what tops you can wear. If you only need to stick to a color scheme, you can find a sweater with flashy buttons, macram√©, lace, or other decorations."

      "content": "Have your uniform custom fit. If you're working with a very strict dress code, this may be one of your only options. Take the uniform to a tailor and pay to have it altered. Here are a few ideas: Bring in the waist or sleeves. If you are proud of your waist or your muscular arms, have the garment narrowed slightly in those areas. Loosen the shirt or skirt. This is most helpful if the uniform is uncomfortably tight, but it can be a fashion statement as well. Hem the skirt . Take care not to bring the skirt higher than the dress code allows. Just fold it over a little bit to create a neater edge."
