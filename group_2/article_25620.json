Her diary, which players could view on her desk, revealed she did not like working at the nail salon 24/7 and dealing with players who didn’t even know her name. [2] X Research source She pledged to get revenge on her enemies and burn down the nail salon. [3] X Research source Beside the diary was a list of names of random players and the DTI games’ developers, including Gigi, the creator of the game. Players interpreted this as a ‘hit list’ of people Lana wanted to harm. Behind Lana were three missing persons’ posters showing Roblox users submiscy, DiarBenOfficial, and M0T0PRINCESS. These avatars were rumored to belong to some of the game’s developers. [4] X Research source"

Lana’s diary changed to a new entry claiming the Lana avatar in the nail salon was a doppelganger (a fake look-alike) and she (the real Lana) had been kidnapped by one of the game’s developers. The diary asked users to find the real Lana and gave them a Roblox user ID: 5759585595. [5] X Research source The fake Lana would glitch and make jerky movements, suggesting she was not real. She also wore belted white pants instead of her usual mini skirt. [6] X Research source In the new diary entry, Lana suggested the fake Lana was the reason players of the game were going missing. This likely referred to the players in the missing persons’ posters in the previous April Fool’s Day update."

In the videos, Agamemnon warned Lana not to share the truth with DTI players. The April 20, 2024 diary entry suggested DTI was run by an evil group called The Awakening. Lana created her own group, Saudade, inviting players to resist The Awakening. [8] X Research source"

Titled Questionnaire, this game was a livestream experience in which players could ask Lana questions about the DTI group (The Awakening) and Lana’s group (Saudade). However, Lana’s responses would contradict themselves. One time, she would claim The Awakening wanted to experiment on DTI players. Another time, she would say the group was not evil. [11] X Research source Posts in the Saudade group around the time of the livestreams claimed Lana’s account was being taken over by someone else. In a later Questionnaire game event, Lana executed three members of the Saudade group as a sacrifice. In the final Questionnaire server livestream, two Saudade members killed Lana’s Roblox user. However, a YouTube video titled “thelastserenade.mp4” suggested Lana would be back and had opened a gate to another dimension. By going through a portal in the Questionnaire game, players went to The Fortress. In this game, notes and writing on the walls hinted at more of Lana’s past. [12] X Research source"

[15] X Research source The player is in Lana’s childhood home when she reveals this information, and sees a two-headed monster there, thought to be her parents.
