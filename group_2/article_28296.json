      "content": "Select a video quality. Choose something that isn't the highest possible quality, and then start watching the video again. If you're still experiencing a lot of buffering after a few minutes, try an even lower quality level. Keep experimenting with video quality until you find one that keeps your playback steady. Did you know you can also download YouTube videos if you have YouTube premium? There are also a few other ways to download YouTube videos using 3rd-party software. If you're still having issues, see the Troubleshooting Playback Issues method below."

You can do this on most web browsers by right-clicking a blank area of the page and selecting Reload . If you're using the YouTube mobile app, try closing the app and re-opening it."

      "content": "Close all open applications on your computer, phone, or tablet. YouTube playback may need to buffer more often if your computer, phone, or tablet is doing too much. Once all apps are closed, re-open YouTube (either the mobile app or in your web browser) and give it another try. If you're watching YouTube videos in a web browser, try closing excess open browser tabs. Having many browser tabs open at once hogs precious RAM and CPU power, which can impact streaming video."

If you're on a phone or tablet and having trouble with the app, see if the problem persists in a web browser. If YouTube works fine in another browser: Clear your web browser cache. See How to Clear Your Browser's Cache to learn how to do this on nearly every browser. If you're using the YouTube app on an Android, iPhone, or iPad, check the Play Store or App Store for updates to the app. If you're using Chrome on a computer, click the ⋮ at the top-right corner of Chrome, then click New incognito window . Now, navigate to YouTube and start watching a video. If the video isn't stopping frequently to buffer, the issue is likely related to a bad Chrome extension. Return to the ⋮ menu, select Tools , and then click Extensions to disable unknown extensions."

If YouTube is only performing poorly when you're connected to a specific network, such as your home Wi-Fi network, see if you have the same issue when you get online a different way. Some examples: If you're using a phone or tablet, try using mobile data (data rates may apply) to see if you're having the same issue. Or, if you've already been using mobile data, try connecting to Wi-Fi. If you're using Wi-Fi on a computer, try connecting directly to your router with an Ethernet cable. If this takes care of the problem, your Wi-Fi connection might be weak or overloaded."
