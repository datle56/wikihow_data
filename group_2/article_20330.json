Whereas tall guys are a dime a dozen, finding someone who can make her laugh isn't nearly as common. Having a good sense of humor is a far better selling point than simply being a little taller. Don't hesitate to make a quip about how you have trouble reaching the top shelf or need platform shoes to drive when the situation calls for it. Saying something like \"I'm so short you can see my feet in my driver's license photo\" can really help to break the ice.
