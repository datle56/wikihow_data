      "content": "Check if your Nintendo Switch can be hacked. Not all Nintendo Switches can be hacked. Newer models, as well as Nintendo Switch Lite and OLED models, have been patched to prevent hacking. If you have one of these models, the only way to hack it is to disassemble it and install a mod chip, which is beyond the scope of this guide. Use the following steps to check and see if your Switch can be hacked: Check the serial number on the bottom of your Switch. Go to https://ismyswitchpatched.com/ in a web browser. Use the drop-down menu to select the serial number prefix (If you don't see your prefix, it's probably a newer model that has been patched). Enter your Switch's serial number in the bar. Check the results. If your Switch has not been patched, you can continue. If it has been patched, you cannot continue. Some serial numbers are unknown if they've been patched or not. If you have one of these serial numbers, you won't know if your Switch has been patched or not until you try to enter recovery mode."
