      "title": "Eat first.",
      "content": "Eat first. When you consume alcohol, it sits in your stomach while it waits to be processed. If you don't have food in there, the alcohol will process faster and at one time. If you have food in your belly, the alcohol will enter your system more slowly and at a varied pace thus lessening the effects of alcohol immediately.

      "title": "Drink slowly.",
      "content": "Drink slowly. For the same reason that you want food in your stomach, drinking slowly will allow your body to process the alcohol over a period of time. Whereas, if you inundate your body with alcohol, it will be more difficult to process."

      "title": "Choose your beverages carefully.",
      "content": "Choose your beverages carefully. Choose alcohols with fewer congeners (substances that are also produced during the fermentation process), which are less likely to cause a hangover. Light-colored beers and white wine have fewer congeners than darker beers and harder liquors. Stay away from brandy, whisky, and red wine. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Cheap boozes tend to give you a worse hangover. Your body expends more energy to process impurities left in the alcohol. Clearer alcohols like vodka, gin, and white rum are good options."

      "title": "Drink plenty of water.",
      "content": "Drink plenty of water. Drink water throughout the day before you start drinking alcohol and drink water in between alcoholic beverages. As one of the key causes of a hangover is dehydration, the more you do to combat it beforehand the better. If you have a hangover, be sure to drink plenty of water as well. [3] X Research source Drink a pint of water before you go to sleep at night. Since your body continues to process water while you sleep — albeit less water — you will still wake up more dehydrated than when you go to bed. Since hangovers operate on dehydration, you can help lessen the effects of alcohol by drinking more water. [4] X Research source Try to leave a glass of water by your bed so you can drink it when you wake up."

      "content": "Drink sports drinks. In addition to water, these isotonic sports drinks can quickly replenish the fluids in your body, while adding carbohydrates needed for energy and electrolytes to your system. [5] X Research source Sports drinks can be good to ease an upset stomach, too. Pick a flavor that tastes good and won't make you further nauseous."

      "content": "Drink some orange juice. Vitamin C, specifically, helps replenish energy, which is vital when the lethargic power of a hangover kicks in. The fructose found in many types of juices will help replenish sugars in your body depleted in order to process the alcohol you've consumed. [6] X Research source Tomato juice and coconut water are also great options."

      "title": "Stay away from caffeinated beverages.",
      "content": "Stay away from caffeinated beverages. Since alcohol is a depressant and makes people sleepy, it seems like the common cure-all would be coffee. Yet, coffee will further dehydrate you. If you have an upset stomach too, coffee may further irritate it. Stick to water. Rest is better than coffee. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Drink Sprite.",
      "content": "Drink Sprite. Chinese researchers tested the effects of 57 drinks and found that Sprite was the most effective at combatting hangover effects. The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase is released by your liver when you consume alcohol. The longer this enzyme is in your system directly relates to the length of your hangover. Get rid of it quickly if you want a shorter hangover. These researchers found that Sprite flushed the human system of alcohol dehydrogenase faster than any other beverage. Herbal tea actually prolonged the presence of this enzyme. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't drink more alcohol. Stay away from \"the hair of the dog that bit you.\" While many people will tell you to just drink a little more of what you drank the night before to get over a hangover, don't listen to them. All you'll be doing is prolonging the effects of the alcohol. It may numb your symptoms in the short-term, it'll probably worsen the hangover in the long term. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Eat some eggs.",
      "content": "Eat some eggs. Eggs are an essential foodstuff for any hangover cure repertoire. They contain an amino acid called cysteine, which soaks up the toxins introduced to your body by alcohol. Eat a few egg whites and soon enough you'll begin feeling back to normal. Fry or scramble them; it doesn't matter how you prepare your eggs, as long as they are cooked. An urban myth says to drink a couple raw eggs after a night out on the town. The slimy factor mixed with the ever-present danger of salmonella make this myth simply that — a myth."

      "content": "Eat foods rich in potassium, like bananas. Since you urinate more when you drink heavily, your body is losing its precious potassium. Lower potassium levels lead to lethargy, nausea, and weakness. Bananas and kiwis are great sources of potassium. Baked potatoes, leafy greens, apricots, and mushrooms are also loaded with potassium. Consider chasing that last drink with a banana to lessen the effects of alcohol. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Go for a short walk. A great way to get your alcohol's effects under control is to go for a walk. Walking speeds up your metabolism, processing what's in your stomach faster. So going for a short stroll may help reduce the duration of your alcohol's effects. Obviously, alcohol impairs your ability to walk, so make sure you go for your jaunt in a safe space — away from cars and stairs (the two greatest dangers to the drunk). [15] X Research source"
