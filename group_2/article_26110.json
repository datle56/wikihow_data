Making the decision to live without spending money is life-changing, particularly if you are living with and/or supporting others. You may find it helpful to start small and go for a week or month without spending money to see if the cash-free life is for you. There are many ways to cut spending in your daily life, and even if you don’t decide to go totally cashless, these techniques will help you save money. If you live in an area where walking or biking to work is feasible, you could avoid your commute and its expenses (gas, tolls, parking, car maintenance) by choosing self-powered transportation. Plus, it’s great for boosting fitness! Try going for a week without buying any groceries. Use only the foods you currently have in your pantry and fridge to make meals. Many websites are available to help you create meals from ingredients you already have on hand. [1] X Research source If you enjoy going out for entertainment, find free entertainment in your area. Your local newspaper’s website will usually have listings of free activities and events. In addition to books and free internet, public libraries often have movies you can check out for free. Going for a walk or spending the evening playing games with friends or family is always free. www.moneyless.org is an online database of useful tips and tricks for pursuing a cash-free existence."

      "content": "Examine your (and your family’s) needs. If you’re a single person, living without money will be much easier to manage than if you have a family. Because living cash-free is a huge commitment, you will want to make sure that your essential needs can still be met without money. For example, if you or a family member tend to require frequent medical care or prescription medications, living without money may not be a good option for you. If you live in an extreme climate, such as a place that is very hot or very cold, it may not be safe to live without some temperature control. This is especially true if your family includes small children or elderly persons, who are more prone to heat- and cold-related illnesses and fatalities.

Whether you want to take up a nomadic lifestyle such as the German cash-free liver Heidemarie Schwermer or live completely off the land and off-grid in a cave like Daniel Suelo, reading what the experience of living without money has been like for others will help you decide whether you’re up for the challenge. The Moneyless Man: A Year of Freeconomic Living by Mark Boyle is a first-person account of living without money. He has also written blogs, a book called The Moneyless Manifesto',\" and established a low-cost living website called Streetbank. The Man Who Quit Money by Mark Sundeen is a biography of Daniel Suelo, a man who has lived without money for over 14 years. The 2012 documentary film, Living Without Money , documents the life of Heidemarie Schwermer, a German woman who has been living without cash since the 1990s."

      "content": "Consider what you have to invest. Some things that make living without spending money easier, such as vegetable gardens, solar power grids, composting toilets, and water wells, require upfront investment. The financial rewards of reducing or even eliminating most of your household bills are significant, but may not happen overnight. If you live in an urban area and/or don’t own your home, your options for some of these things may be reduced. You should do some research to understand what is feasible for you."

For example, if you require prescription medication, you should not simply stop spending money on it; consult a physician before stopping any medication. If you cannot or do not want to sell your house, you will need to continue making mortgage payments to avoid foreclosure and eviction. If you decide to keep a job, you will need to continue to pay taxes."

You can often find these materials for free or very cheaply, and you can often barter for labor help.

      "content": "Educate yourself about your food options. If you plan to forage for food, find a good guidebook on what types of plants grow in your area, which are edible, and which are poisonous; Richard Mabey’s Food For Free is a classic, illustrated handbook that is widely available and well-reviewed. If you plan to grow your own food, research the most effective ways of dividing land, planting seeds, and tending to your crops. If you have a university or college in your area, see if it has a cooperative extension. These offices provide education for the community on many things, including food cultivation and foraging, and often it is free to attend classes or get information. Remember that foods grow seasonally. Berries tend to be ready to be picked in the summer, while apples and nuts are harvestable in the autumn. Greens are often harvestable year-round. Whether you forage or grow your own crops, ensuring that you have foods to harvest year-round will help you keep a nutritionally balanced diet."

Even if you live in a suburban neighborhood, your neighbors may have things like fruit trees that produce more food than they can use. Always ask before you take food from others. How to Forage for Food in the Fall Avoid collecting any nuts or plants which show signs of being partially eaten by another animal, have been broken open in a fall from a tree, or seem partially rotten, as these are likely to contain dangerous bacterial growth. Avoid picking greens and other plants near busy roads, or industrial sites, where runoff from the cars or pollution from industry may have contaminated your food source. Instead, look for food in rural, less developed areas, away from the impact of cars, industry, and technology. Never eat anything you cannot identify. If you’re unsure whether something is hazardous, it’s best to bypass it."

      "content": "Ask local stores, farmers markets, and restaurants for leftovers. Many grocery stores and restaurants throw away unwanted or excess food, as well as food that is past its sell-by date but still edible. Ask a manager what their policies are for disposing of these products. You can also ask vendors at local farmers markets if they have discarded produce you may take away. Be cautious of meat, dairy, and eggs, as the risk of bacterial growth and foodborne illness is higher. Independent and family-owned stores may be more accommodating than mega chain stores, although stores such as Trader Joe’s are well-known for giving discarded food away. Make a name for yourself in your neighborhood. Most households waste thousands of dollars in uneaten food a year. Consider putting up a flyer in your local community center about yourself and your cash-free aspirations. Many people may be happy to donate slightly off fruits, vegetables, or older dried goods."

      "content": "Barter for food. Bartering, or haggling, for food, is a great way to negotiate prices, add variety to your diet, and exchange items you don't want for things that are more useful. How to Barter You may find that people are willing to offer you food or goods in exchange for odd jobs such as window washing or mowing the lawn. Look at what you have to trade. Do you grow vegetables that your neighbors don't? Do you have skills that people around you need? Consider using your homegrown potatoes and handpicked berries, your fence-painting or babysitting skills, and your dog-walking experience to trade for fruits that you cannot grow or pick on your own, Remember: In a successful negotiation, both parties win. Be fair in your request. Is an hour of babysitting really worth ten pounds of fresh apples? Or is it more worth five?"

      "content": "Grow your own food. The art of gardening is a financially savvy and personally fulfilling way to feed yourself from your own land and hands. It’s possible even in an urban or suburban location to grow vegetables and fruits. Even if you can’t subsist entirely on food you grow yourself, the produce you grow in your own garden will be healthier and cheaper than what you buy in the store. Decide what is most feasible to grow in your area. The easiest way to determine which plants thrive in your region is to visit a local farm or to speak with someone who tends an extensive food garden. Differences in regional climate and soil greatly affect which vegetables and fruits thrive in which areas. Build a greenhouse! Using recycled garbage bags over a wood frame, you can grow hardy vegetables, such as potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and radishes, in colder climates, even when there is snow on the ground. Ask your neighbors if any are interested in co-opting a garden space. Sharing the labor and time necessary to grow your own food, in exchange for a larger space of land, and a greater variety of fruits and vegetables is a wonderful way to diversify your diet, decrease your workload, and build community friendships."

Sometimes the item may be something someone just wants to give away, or you may find people willing to trade items for skills you have. Look for items you want to get rid of. One's man trash is another man's treasure, so instead of selling your old shoes or watch on eBay, or throwing them away, try using them in exchange for items or services that you need.
