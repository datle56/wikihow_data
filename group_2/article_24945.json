The first step in staying calm during tough times is relaxing your mind and body so you can think clearly, remain rational, and do your best to navigate through the challenges you are being faced with. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Breathing is your best friend, always. Allowing your body to oxygenate not only helps your muscles relax but also gets oxygen to your brain. By focusing on your breath, you are giving your mind and emotions a much needed break. Taking deep breaths can be done anywhere: at work, at home, in your car, doing dishes, in the shower, or whenever you feel like your nerves are creeping up on you. If you can, try to focus on breathing all the way down in to your belly, and exhaling back from your belly."

Tapping, or Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), is a technique in which the individual taps on acupressure points to relieve stress and overwhelming emotions., [2] X Research source Identify the most immediate issue that is bothering you. Locate points on your body to tap. Some of these include: [3] X Research source The outside of your hand on the fleshy part. On the top center of your head. The point where your eyebrow begins. On the bone outside the corner of your eye. Under your nose at the top of your upper lip. Use two fingers to tap on one of the points. Tap about five times on the point. Move on to the next point. Repeat acceptance to yourself. For example, as you tap, say to yourself, “Even though I feel like I’m going to cry every minute, I deeply and completely accept myself.”"

      "title": "Try visualization exercises.",
      "content": "Try visualization exercises. One of the easiest ways to calm your mind is to use a very simple visualization process where you count backwards from 10 to 1. Similar to breathing exercises, this can be done anywhere, and you are simply adding a mental picture of numbers. Start at the number 10 as you inhale fully into your belly. Exhale on the number 9. As you visualize the numbers getting smaller, also visualize that they are moving downward through your body. Notice any tension you might be holding in your muscles and let your breath and focus on the numbers ease the tension away."

Archetypes: Toward a Jungian Anthropology of Consciousness. Anthropology of Consciousness. Fall2012, Vol. 23 Issue 2, p127-157. For example, teddy bears may hold a nostalgic meaning of safety and comfort, or there may be certain movies that make you feel inspired. Perhaps a certain famous person reminds you to be strong in the face of adversity. Looking at pictures of your children or loved ones may bring you feelings of empowerment."

Many times you can feel angry, helpless, afraid, sad, grief, or ashamed when life has thrown you an overwhelming challenge. When emotions are bottled up, they add to feelings of panic and feeling out of control. Learning to honor your emotions will also help prepare you for understanding more coping strategies. [7] X Research source Rietti, Sophie. Emotion-Work and the Philosophy of Emotion. Journal of Social Philosophy. Spring2009, Vol. 40 Issue 1, p55-74. Use a journal to write down things that help you release emotions and always remember, as painful as an emotion may seem, it is just an emotion and it will pass. You are an individual and the best way for you to release your emotions is to find and write in your journal what works best for you. Reader Poll: We asked 417 wikiHow readers who journal what practice helps them get the most out of tracking their thoughts and feelings, and only 10% of them agreed that the best way is to record evidence for or against their beliefs about themselves. [Take Poll] Instead, focus on exploring and understanding your emotions rather than passing judgment on yourself."

Using your emotions journal, make a list of all the people, things, circumstances, societal pressures, financial problems, loss, et cetera, of all the things you are angry at.

      "content": "Acknowledge your fears. Fear may be the biggest emotion that gets in the way of feeling calm during tough times. Fear is just an emotion, like all the other emotions. By accepting fear for what it is, an emotional response that can be dealt with like all other emotions, you can take steps toward facing fears. Fear often shows up in your mind with statements like, “I could never do that” or “I’m afraid of change” or “I’m afraid of what might happen.” The truth about fear is that it is always concerned with the future. In your emotions journal, write down everything you are afraid of concerning the challenging time you are going through. Then begin writing down all of the possible outcomes that you can think of, whether they are positive or negative. Also write down changes you might make to your life situation that you would be scared of. Write down the reasons why you are afraid of making these changes. Keep journaling until you find yourself at the root of your fear. Releasing your emotions to the point where you can start being proactive and at least aware of your options can help you stay calm. You can’t make all the difficult life events go away, but you can understand your fear, and that in itself will help ease your fear. [13] X Research source Mikolajczak, et al."

      "title": "Consider ways to deal with your fears.",
      "content": "Consider ways to deal with your fears. After you have explored what you're afraid of in your journal, you can start to take steps to address those fears. The first step is to acknowledge that fear is a natural human response; all humans experience fear at some point. [14] X Research source As with anxiety, the only way to overcome your fear is to acknowledge it and work through it. [15] X Research source Then, use your journal to start exploring ways in which you could approach your fears to overcome them. For example, imagine that you're frustrated at work because your work never gets credit. However, you're afraid of saying anything. Just the thought of talking to your boss fills you with terror. Explore why you're afraid. Is it because your boss has a history of being unreceptive to others' ideas, and so you're worried that he won't listen to you? Is it because you don't feel confident talking to people in a position of authority? Are you worried that bringing up the idea of getting credit for your work will sound needy or demanding, and you might lose your job? Figuring out why you're afraid will help you take the next step. Once you have some idea of why you're afraid, consider ways you could approach the situation that would help you deal with that fear. For example, if you don't feel confident talking to authority figures, you could ask a friend to practice with you. Script a conversation with your boss the way you hope it would go, and the way you're afraid it will go. Then, practice with your friend. This will give you a safe way to trouble-shoot and may help build your confidence. Be patient with yourself. Dealing with fears can be a lifelong learning process, and it may take some time for you to overcome the ones you're currently dealing with."
