      "content": "Gather your supplies. Traditional pruno made by inmates is made with few supplies and the ingredients that are available in prison. But at home, you can also make your own version of pruno using all the convenient equipment and ingredients available in a modern kitchen. To make artisan pruno at home, you'll need: Immersion blender Wooden spoon Large saucepan Small bowl One-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag Clean bath towel Heating pad Strainer Cheesecloth Large bowl Funnel Large sterile bottle or jar with lid"

      "title": "Puree the fruit.",
      "content": "Puree the fruit. Combine the apple and orange chunks, plus the fruit cocktail and raisins, in a large saucepan. Use the immersion blender to puree the fruit until it’s juicy and pulpy, but still has some bite-sized chunks in it. Make sure to move the immersion blender around in the bowl as you blend, to ensure the fruit is pureed evenly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Boil the fruit, sugar, and water.",
      "content": "Boil the fruit, sugar, and water. When the fruit is ready, add the 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 2 cups (474 ml) of the water and stir to combine. Put on the lid, transfer the fruit mixture to the stove, and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Once the fruit comes to a boil, let it simmer for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria that may be present. [1] X Research source Continue stirring the mixture regularly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cool the fruit.",
      "content": "Cool the fruit. After the fruit boils for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat and let it cool. You don’t want it completely cold, but slightly above room temperature to help the yeast flourish. As the fruit cools, continue stirring from time to time so it cools evenly. [2] X Research source The cooling process will take about 30 minutes to an hour."
    },
    {
      "title": "Activate the yeast.",
      "content": "Activate the yeast. Combine the yeast, the 1 cup of warm water, and the 3 teaspoons of sugar in a bowl. Set the bowl aside for five to 10 minutes to let it activate. [3] X Research source As the yeast comes to life, it will begin to froth and bubble in the bowl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the yeast and transfer the mixture to the bag.",
      "content": "Add the yeast and transfer the mixture to the bag. Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and stir to fully combine. Transfer the mixture to the plastic bag. Press out as much air as you can, then seal the bag. [4] X Research source It’s important to warm the fruit mixture because the yeast will die if it gets too cold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the mixture somewhere warm and dark.",
      "content": "Store the mixture somewhere warm and dark. Wrap the fruit mixture in a clean bath towel to help keep in the heat. Then place the towel on top of an electric heating pad turned to low temperature. Transfer the fruit, towel, and heating pad to a dark place, such as a closet. If you don’t have an electric heating pad, fill a hot water bottle with warm water. Be sure to check on the water ever six to 12 hours, and add fresh warm water as necessary when the bottle starts to get cold. The reason you have to keep the fruit mixture warm is so the yeast will stay alive to ferment the fruit and turn it to alcohol."

    {
      "title": "Burp the bag daily.",
      "content": "Burp the bag daily. As the yeast converts the sugars in the bag to alcohol and carbon dioxide, the bag will slowly fill up with gas. To prevent it from bursting, remove the bag from the towel once or twice a day and open the bag to release the gas and pressure. Reseal the bag, wrap it back in the towel, and return it to its dark spot on the heating pad. When the mixture stops bloating, it means the yeast has converted all the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide, meaning the pruno is ready. This will take about five days. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Strain the pruno. When the mixture has stopped bloating, it’s ready to strain. Place a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl. Pour the fruit mixture into the strainer and let the juice drain down into the bowl. [6] X Research source To get the most juice out, wring out the cheesecloth with the fruit still inside."

      "content": "Transfer to a bottle and chill before serving. Place the funnel inside the neck of a sterile glass jar or bottle. Pour the pruno into the bottle. Transfer the bottle to the fridge and allow it to chill for several hours or overnight. [7] X Research source A large mason jar will work to store your pruno, or a large two-liter pop bottle."

      "title": "Gather a few supplies.",
      "content": "Gather a few supplies. The idea behind minimalist pruno is that it’s more like making the type of pruno that inmates make, so it doesn’t require any fancy cooking tools or utensils. What you will need is: One-gallon (3.8-L) sealable plastic bag Three clean towels A large bowl or sink Hot running water Spoon or t-shirt"

      "content": "Combine and mash the fruit. Break the oranges into wedges and place them in the sealable bag. Add the fruit cocktail and seal the bag tightly. With the fruit sealed inside the bag, squish the fruit between your fingers to break it up into small chunks. The fruit is ready when it becomes the consistency of fruit pulp mixed with paste. You can substitute some of the orange with apples, peaches, pears, or any other fruit that’s available to you. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Add water and heat the fruit.",
      "content": "Add water and heat the fruit. Open the bag and pour in the water. Then seal the bag again. Place the bag of mashed fruit into a sink or bowl and cover it with the hottest water you can get from the tap. Let the fruit sit in the hot water for 15 minutes. [9] X Research source Add fresh hot water every five minutes. If you don’t have a bowl or a plug for the sink, keep the water from the tap running over the fruit for 15 minutes."

      "content": "Wrap and hide the mixture. Once the mixture is good and warm from the water, wrap it in the towels to help keep in the heat. Then transfer the mixture to a dark place for 48 hours. The heat is necessary for the fermentation process, because otherwise the wild yeast will die instead of converting the sugar to alcohol."

      "title": "Add the sugar and ketchup.",
      "content": "Add the sugar and ketchup. After two days, unwrap the towels from around the bag. The bag should have ballooned up with gases, so open the bag to release the gas. Add the sugar cubes and ketchup. Seal the bag and let the mixture sit for 10 to 15 minutes to let the sugar dissolve. [10] X Research source The amount of ketchup you need for this recipe is equivalent to about 3.5 ketchup packets. If you don’t have access to ketchup, you can also use a piece of bread broken up into small pieces. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Strain or skim before consuming. After three days or when the bag stops bloating with gases overnight, open the bag and skim off the fruit mash to leave the liquid behind. If it’s available, use a tea strainer, clean sock, or clean t-shirt to separate the fruit mash and strain the liquid. [12] X Research source Transfer the liquid to cups before serving, or return it to the plastic bag and drink straight from the bag."
