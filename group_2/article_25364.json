      "title": "Without human contact, we tend to feel a lot lonelier.",
      "content": "Without human contact, we tend to feel a lot lonelier. If you aren’t getting enough physical contact in your daily life, you might feel extremely lonely or on your own. Loneliness can happen even if you live with someone or you’re in a relationship—if you’re touch starved, you’re going to crave that human connection no matter what. [1] X Research source Loneliness can feel different for different people. For a lot of people, it feels like a deep sense of sadness or loss, especially when you see others that are close to each other."

      "title": "Physical contact helps reduce stress and relax tension.",
      "content": "Physical contact helps reduce stress and relax tension. When you aren’t touched for a long time, you might find that you’re feeling a bit more stressed out and high strung than usual. This is your body’s way of signaling that you need more human touch. [2] X Research source Fortunately, stress-relieving activities like self care, yoga, and meditation can lower your stress levels and leave you feeling better overall."

    {
      "title": "Touch starvation can worsen anxiety disorders.",
      "content": "Touch starvation can worsen anxiety disorders. If you already struggled with anxiety and now it’s getting worse, it’s probably because you’re touch starved. You might feel more on edge, more stressed, or unable to do things you normally would without feeling intense anxiety. [3] X Research source Touch starvation can also exacerbate other mental illnesses, like depression."

    {
      "title": "You probably aren't getting enough human contact if you're isolated.",
      "content": "You probably aren't getting enough human contact if you're isolated. Even if you like being alone, when you spend most of your time by yourself, you probably aren’t touching people or interacting with them very much. Even the most introverted of introverts needs a high-five or a hug every now and then. [4] X Research source If your loved ones live far away, you can still get some human interaction by video chatting or calling them on the phone. It won’t be quite the same as an in-person hangout, but it will be close!"

    {
      "title": "Feeling lonely or anxious can sometimes cause sleep problems.",
      "content": "Feeling lonely or anxious can sometimes cause sleep problems. Insomnia is a common marker of touch starvation, which can be hard to deal with. While it’s not the only indicator that you are touch starved, if you have trouble sleeping on top of a sense of loneliness, touch starvation could be the reason. [5] X Research source If your lack of sleep is starting to affect your life, talk to your doctor about getting a sleep aid. Or, try using a weighted blanket to simulate the feeling of being cuddled at night."

    {
      "title": "Not being touched can actually drain your energy.",
      "content": "Not being touched can actually drain your energy. If you’re sleeping okay but you always wake up feeling tired, it could be because you’re lacking human contact. This can be for a multitude of reasons, but the biggest one is probably because loneliness can be exhausting. [6] X Research source You might also feel more fatigued throughout the day or need more rest times."

    {
      "title": "Studies show that not being touched can affect how you see yourself.",
      "content": "Studies show that not being touched can affect how you see yourself. If you have a negative view of your own body or you struggle with disordered eating, touch starvation may play a role in that. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Fortunately, talk therapy and mental health professionals can help you work through any issues surrounding your body so you can regain your confidence. This is most common for people who experienced touch starvation early in their childhoods."

      "title": "Touch deprivation can make you feel irritated.",
      "content": "Touch deprivation can make you feel irritated. Lack of human touch is linked to aggressive behavior. If you’re feeling more on edge lately or you’re quicker to yell when you’re mad, it might be because you’re touch starved. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Aggressive behavior can be both verbal and physical. Fortunately, studies show that aggressive behavior decreases when you implement massage therapy."

      "title": "You may be craving non-sexual intimacy.",
      "content": "You may be craving non-sexual intimacy. Even when you’re in a romantic relationship (and having sex), you can still experience touch deprivation. This usually happens when you and your partner aren’t touching each other enough non-sexually. You might feel moody, on-edge, or irritated with your partner, even when they haven’t done anything wrong. [9] X Research source If you think this might be the case for you, sit down with your partner and talk about it. You can both work to touch each other more on a daily basis. Things like holding hands, hugging each other, and giving each other massages can help you alleviate your skin hunger."

      "title": "Skin hunger leads to stress, and stress can cause sexual dysfunction.",
      "content": "Skin hunger leads to stress, and stress can cause sexual dysfunction. If you’re having problems with your libido (or you’ve lost it entirely), it may be related to your touch starvation. Human touch calms us down and makes us feel more relaxed, which leaves us more open to having sex. [10] X Research source If you’re concerned about your loss of libido, talk to a doctor. Lowered libido can happen for many reasons, and your doctor may be able to help you figure out where it’s coming from."

      "title": "You might find yourself craving the dissociation that comes with using substances.",
      "content": "You might find yourself craving the dissociation that comes with using substances. When you use drugs or alcohol, you don’t feel as stressed, and you won’t think about your lack of human contact as much. In general, it’s okay to drink alcohol in moderation, but if you find yourself drinking daily or using drugs, get professional help right away. There are other ways to cope with being touch starved, including hugging inanimate objects and taking warm showers, that don’t negatively impact your health."
