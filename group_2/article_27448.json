      "title": "Put white glue, liquid starch, and shaving cream in a large mixing bowl.",
      "content": "Put white glue, liquid starch, and shaving cream in a large mixing bowl. Pour 2 ⅔ cups (417 mL) of Elmer’s white school glue and 2 cups (500 mL) of shaving cream into the bowl. Add ⅔ cup (167 mL) of liquid starch as the last ingredient. [1] X Research source You can use clear glue instead of white glue to make the slime more translucent."

      "title": "Add food coloring to the mixture if you want to change the color of the slime.",
      "content": "Add food coloring to the mixture if you want to change the color of the slime. Put a few drops of food coloring into the bowl with the ingredients. This will change the color of the slime from white to any other color you want. [2] X Research source Divide the batch into separate bowls before you add food coloring if you want multiple colors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir all the ingredients together until you get a stiff texture.",
      "content": "Stir all the ingredients together until you get a stiff texture. Mix the ingredients together as much as you can with a spoon or other mixing utensil. Stop stirring when the slime is too stiff to mix anymore with a utensil. [3] X Research source If the slime is too stiff, then add 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of water at a time and keep mixing it to make it softer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the slime with your hands when it becomes too stiff to mix with a utensil.",
      "content": "Knead the slime with your hands when it becomes too stiff to mix with a utensil. Use your hands and knuckles to knead the mixture like bread dough. Stop when it is all an even putty-like consistency. [4] X Research source You can take the slime out of the bowl and knead it on a counter or cutting board at this point if it’s easier."

    {
      "title": "Store fluffy slime in airtight containers if you aren’t making iceberg slime.",
      "content": "Store fluffy slime in airtight containers if you aren’t making iceberg slime. Put your new fluffy slime in jars, sealable bags, or tupperware containers. This will keep your slime moist and fresh. [5] X Research source If you want to make iceberg slime right away, then don’t store the fluffy slime in airtight containers."

    {
      "title": "Put fluffy slime in a bowl and flatten it out.",
      "content": "Put fluffy slime in a bowl and flatten it out. Place a batch of fluffy slime into a bowl, or divide it among several if you want to create several smaller batches of iceberg slime. Flatten it out with your hands so that it creates an even layer in the bowl. You can get some cheap plastic bowls at a dollar store that are perfect for making iceberg slime in."

    {
      "title": "Leave the bowl uncovered for 2-4 days until the top layer is crunchy.",
      "content": "Leave the bowl uncovered for 2-4 days until the top layer is crunchy. Place the bowl with the fluffy slime on the counter or somewhere else out of the way. Leave it for 2 days, then check on the surface to see if it is hard. Leave it for another 1-2 days if the top layer has not hardened yet. [6] X Research source The top layer should crack when you press your finger against it when the fluffy slime has turned into iceberg slime. Larger batches of slime take longer to harden."
    },
    {
      "title": "Poke and play with the iceberg slime, then let it dry out again.",
      "content": "Poke and play with the iceberg slime, then let it dry out again. Use your fingers and hands to crack the surface of the iceberg slime for a fun sensory activity. Knead and squish the slime together until it is an even consistency again, then flatten it out in a bowl and let it harden again for 2-3 days to create another batch of iceberg slime. After the second batch of iceberg slime, it’s best to make a fresh batch of fluffy slime and start the process over again before it gets old and stinky."
