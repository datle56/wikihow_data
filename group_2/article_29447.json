      "content": "Make the outer ears. Draw 2 semicircles that are each about 4-inches (10.16) wide on gray, black, or brown felt (or furry fabric), then cut them out using scissors. These will be the ears. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fasten the inner ears to the outer ears.",
      "content": "Fasten the inner ears to the outer ears. You can sew, glue or pin one pink inner ear to one grey, black, or brown outer ear, then repeat with the other set. These form the completed mouse ears."

      "title": "Attach the ears to a hoodie.",
      "content": "Attach the ears to a hoodie. [3] X Research source Sew, glue, or pin the ears to the hood of a plain grey, black, or brown hooded sweatshirt. The costume will look best if the hoodie is the same color as the outer ears. Make sure that one mouse ear is attached to each side of the hood, and not too high up on it. You can put on the hood and test out the ears before attaching them to decide which exact position looks best."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a mouse belly.",
      "content": "Add a mouse belly. This step is optional, but can add a touch more flair if you have time. Lay the hoodie on a flat surface, and cut out an oval of pink felt (or another contrasting color) that is the width and height of the front of the hoodie. Then sew, glue, or pin the oval to the hoodie to serve as the belly."

      "title": "Use sweatpants as the legs.",
      "content": "Use sweatpants as the legs. [4] X Research source A regular pair of sweatpants in the same color as the hoodie (gray, black, or brown) make the perfect pair of mouse legs. Simply put them on once the rest of the costume is finished."

    {
      "title": "Make the mouse-tail.",
      "content": "Make the mouse-tail. Take a tube sock that is the same color as the outer mouse ears and the hoodie (or pink). [5] X Research source Fill it with newspaper or fiberfill so that it looks like a tail, then sew, glue, or pin it to either the bottom back of the sweatshirt or the back waistband of the sweatpants. You can cut off one leg of a pair of tights and use it in the same way to make a mouse-tail—just make sure to tie, sew, glue, or pin one end closed before you stuff it."

      "title": "Paint on a mouse face.",
      "content": "Paint on a mouse face. [6] X Research source Once you've made all the pieces of the costume and have put them on, you're ready to draw the mouse's face. You can use regular makeup. Put a dot of pink lipstick on the end of your nose to make the mouse’s nose. Use eyeliner (black, brown, or white) to draw a few whiskers across your cheeks."

      "title": "Put on paws.",
      "content": "Put on paws. If you would like to complete the mouse look, you can put socks on your feet that match the color of the mouse costume, and socks or mittens on your hands. These will serve as the mouse’s paws. You can use socks or mittens of the same color, or a contrasting one. For instance, if you have a black mouse body, then white paws might look nice."

      "title": "Buy a pair of pre-made mouse ears.",
      "content": "Buy a pair of pre-made mouse ears. Mouse ear headbands can be purchased from many department and party stores, especially around Halloween. When you need to make a mouse costume in a hurry, these are a great start. You can also easily make your own mouse ears headband. Just cut two small (about two inches) rounded ears out of felt or furry fabric (gray, brown, black, or white) and glue them to a plain headband. You can also glue a pipe cleaner to each ear and attach its ends to the headband for more stability. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use clothing for the mouse body. Some clothing that is the same color (usually black, brown, gray, or white) as the pre-made mouse ears will make a quick and simple mouse body for your costume. You can use clothing you already have, or purchase new items. Women can use things like a tank dress, leggings and a tank top, a solid color dress, or sweatpants and a sweatshirt. Men can use things like sweatpants and a sweatshirt, or pants and a t-shirt of the same color. Anyone can also use some black, brown, gray or white footed pajamas as the mouse’s body."
