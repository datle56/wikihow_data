      "content": "Some foods are proven to help reduce your body’s stress and anxiety. Certain foods are known to fight the symptoms of stress, while others increase them. Make an effort to incorporate stress-relieving foods into your diet , including vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, seafood, and plain yogurt. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source On the other hand, minimize the amount of caffeine, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners in your diet—they can raise your stress levels. That doesn’t mean you can never have a cup of coffee or a glass of wine again. Just enjoy them in moderation! For example, limit yourself to a single cup of coffee or alcoholic drink with dinner—and don’t drink alcohol or caffeine every day. You can always enjoy a decaffeinated coffee or a virgin cocktail (without the liquor) in place of your usual caffeine or alcohol as well. An artificial sweetener is a food additive that makes something taste sweet without actually containing much sugar. You’ll see them often in drinks or snacks advertised as being “low-sugar” or “zero-sugar.”"

      "content": "Listening to music you love can lower your stress levels. Studies have shown that music isn’t only fun to listen to; it’s also genuinely an effective stress reliever! So, make a point to listen to music to create a truly relaxing weekend for yourself. Sit and listen to music deliberately, or simply play it in the background while doing other things. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source Play whatever kind of music you usually enjoy listening to. You might make a playlist of your current favorite songs, for example. If you’re unsure what to listen to, plenty of music streaming platforms (like Spotify or Amazon Music ) have featured playlists tailored to a particular genre or mood. You might even be able to find a playlist design for relaxation!"

      "content": "Inhaling essential oils is super relaxing and a great mood stabilizer. Turn your home into a calming environment by using an oil diffuser. Place the diffuser in a room you often use—like your bedroom or living room, for example. Then, choose an essential oil known for its stress-relieving capabilities to use with the diffuser, like lavender, chamomile, lemongrass, or sandalwood. [4] X Research source This is also known as aromatherapy, which involves inhaling essential oils to take advantage of their calming properties.

      "content": "Meditation is a great way to decompress and de-stress. It’s designed to quiet your mind, clearing it of everything—current worries and obligations included—leaving you feeling calm and relaxed afterward. If you’ve been feeling a little tense or anxious, try setting aside some time to meditate . It doesn’t take long; if nothing else, try meditating for 10 minutes before bed on Sunday night to relax before the week starts. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure you meditate somewhere quiet and peaceful at home. That way, you won’t be distracted by any background noises. Set a timer before meditating so you won’t get distracted by how much time you have left. It’s okay if you can’t meditate for very long at first—start low, at 3 or 5 minutes, and go up from there."

      "content": "A regular sleep routine is best for your health and well-being. It might seem like sleeping in super late over the weekend is the best way to catch up on sleep , but in reality, a steady sleep schedule is much healthier. The average adult needs 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night—so over the weekend, ensure that’s what you get. Consistency reinforces your body’s sleep-wake cycle, which will help you stay rested during the week. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Of course, it’s still okay to sleep in if you really need it (particularly if you had a very late night). Overall, however, try sticking to a single sleep schedule as much as you can. Plus, if you do something tiring over the weekend, you can always take a power nap during the day."

      "content": "Make your Sundays fun to make Monday seem less daunting. Plenty of people spend their Sunday evenings prepping for the week ahead or doing all the chores they didn’t tackle over the rest of the weekend—but that can make for a pretty stressful Sunday. However, it’s easier to start your Monday off on a positive note if the last thing you do on Sunday is actually enjoyable. So, plan a fun final activity to round out your relaxing weekend. [7] X Research source For example, you might do a couple of chores on Sunday afternoon—but then spend Sunday evening cooking dinner and playing games with your partner or enjoying a quiet movie night with a couple of close friends. It may also help to think of something you’re looking forward to in the week ahead. Sunday nights can feel gloomy if you’re stressing about your week, so instead, think of something that makes you feel excited and optimistic."

      "content": "You’re more likely to relax and have fun if you’re in a vacation mindset. It’s easy to spend your whole weekend thinking about work and everything coming up over the next week rather than unwinding. However, if you put yourself in a “vacation” mindset, you’re actually more likely to take it easy and relax—spending more time on leisure activities and less on chores or work. In short, it helps you live in the moment a little more. [8] X Research source For example, rather than telling yourself, “I have two days until work starts again,” try telling yourself something like, “I have two days of vacation!”"

Practice by identifying 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This relaxation technique can help you center yourself and live in the moment (rather than worrying about the future).

It might seem like weekends are the best times to do all of your chores—but if you’re running around tackling responsibilities all weekend, you might not have time to relax! So, instead, make a to-do list and plan to get a few chores handled on Friday. That way, come Saturday morning, you’ll have nothing to do but kick back and enjoy your free time. [10] X Research source Better yet, make a plan to get most of your chores done throughout the week whenever you have free time. If you space out your chores and tackle one or two each day, you won’t have as much to do by Friday. Plus, if you tackle your chores early enough on Friday afternoon, you might still have some time to decompress on Friday night. For example, you might read a favorite book or watch a movie when your work is finished."

It can speed up your mental recovery from stress and help your ability to focus. So, take advantage of those perks and pick an outdoor activity or two to try over the weekend. For example: Go hiking on a scenic forest or mountain trail. Do some sunset yoga outside in your yard or a park. Take a bike ride around your town or visit a local bike trail. It’s okay if you’re usually not too keen on spending time outside. Even a simple 30-minute walk around your neighborhood can be super refreshing!"
