      "content": "Figure out your skin type. Wash your face and pat it dry, then wait for an hour. Press a clean tissue to your nose, chin, cheeks, and forehead, and then look to see if there’s an oil residue on the tissue. This can help you decide if you have oily, dry, or normal skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source If there’s no oily residue on the tissue and your skin doesn’t feel tight or dry, you have normal skin. If there is oily residue on the tissue, you have oily skin. You may also be prone to acne. If there’s no oily residue on the tissue but your skin is tight and flaky, you have dry skin. Combination skin means that your skin can be dry and oily. It might be flaky and rough around the edges, but oily along the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). Combination skin tends to have visible pores only in the T-zone area. If you have sensitive skin, your skin might get red and irritated very easily. If you can see fine lines or wrinkles in your skin, you have aging skin."

      "content": "Stay away from oil-based products if you have oily skin. Having oily skin means your face produces a surplus of oil throughout the day. While it’s still important to moisturize your face, you should stay away from cleansers and makeup removers that have more oil in them so you don’t overload your skin. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Go for products that say “oil-free” or “noncomedogenic.” If you’re struggling with your oily skin, try using blotting paper throughout the day to gently remove some of the oil from your face. Blotting paper is a thin, tissue-paper like sheet that collects oil gently (and you can even use it on top of makeup)."

      "content": "Go for products with less than 10 ingredients if you have sensitive skin. Sensitive skin needs a little bit of special treatment so you don’t irritate it. As you look for products, try to find ones that have less than 10 ingredients on the back of the bottle to ensure that you aren’t going to make your skin itchy or dry. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Fragrances are often very irritating for sensitive skin. Above all else, pick products that don’t smell like anything. If you’re worried about how your skin might react to a new product, try testing it on a small patch of your face or neck for 24 hours before you use it all over. If you have any redness or itching in that spot, don’t use the product."

While this is totally normal, adding some hydration to your skin can help slow down the process and brighten up your face. Stick to products that are moisturizing and lock in hydration if you have aging skin. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You should also pick products that have SPF in them, as aging skin is very prone to sun damage.

Gently wipe the makeup remover over your face, focusing on the areas where you are wearing makeup. Wipe off your face in a circular motion until the wipe comes away clear, then move onto the rest of your skincare routine. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You can use oil-free makeup remover, micellar water, or makeup wipes to take off your makeup. If makeup is left on the skin overnight it can clog the pores, while also denying skin the opportunity to repair itself from the stresses of the day.

[8] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source Hot water can open up your pores and irritate your skin, while cold water can close your pores and trap dirt and grime.

Squeeze out a pea-sized drop of a gentle, alcohol-free toner, then rub it into your skin to even out your skin tone and lock in hydration. Stay away from toner that has alcohol in it, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin, as it can be irritating.

[11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Physical exfoliants usually come in the form of a scrub and have small, rough particles in them to slough off dead skin and rejuvenate your skin. However, many dermatologists consider this form of exfoliation to be overly harsh on the skin. If you wish to pursue this method, be sure to only do it once a week—doing it too often can lead to redness and irritation, especially if you have sensitive skin. If you have very dry skin, talk to your dermatologist about chemical exfoliators. While chemical exfoliation sounds harsher, it is actually the least irritating form of exfoliation and is ideal for all skin types. Look for products with alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) like glycolic, lactic, or mandelic acid. Exfoliation is very drying, so be sure to follow up with a moisturizer."

Some of the most effective treatments contain ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, retinoids, and azelaic acid.
