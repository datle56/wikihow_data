      "content": "Stepping out into nature can lower your stress levels. When you have a break from work or school, try going for a walk in your neighborhood.

      "content": "Do something spontaneous every now and then. Take the day off work and go for a solo road trip or head out of town. Book a trip to go visit your family when they aren’t expecting it. Doing something out of the ordinary can help keep things exciting and prevent you from getting stuck in a rut. You can also do something spontaneous that isn’t a huge commitment. For instance, if you usually make breakfast at home, go out to a local bakery for a bagel instead."

      "title": "If you don’t have time to do something, just decline.",
      "content": "If you don’t have time to do something, just decline. Taking on too many responsibilities can leave you feeling overwhelmed and undervalued. “No” is a complete sentence, and you never have to explain yourself to anyone if you don’t want to. It can be tough to say no to people at first, especially if you’re used to putting everyone’s needs ahead of your own. Try to think about how you’d tell a friend to act in this situation—if you’d tell them to say no, then you probably should too."
