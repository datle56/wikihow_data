      "title": "Lock your ankle.",
      "content": "Lock your ankle. Locking your ankle ensures that your foot isn't flimsy and doesn't move at all when it contacts the ball. The foot needs to control how the ball moves. For an inside of the foot pass, the toes should point up to lock the ankle. For a shot, on the other hand, the toes should point down to lock the ankle. [1] X Research source The only way to achieve no spin is to lock your ankle. If the foot is flimsy, the ball will make equally flimsy movements and motions."

    {
      "title": "Pass the ball",
      "content": "Pass the ball with the inside of the shoe. Never pass on your toe. Soccer players pass using the inside of the foot because it uses a wider surface area and makes for the most accurate kick. The downside to this kick is that you don't get as much power out of it. Still, it is definitely the most accurate way to pass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position your planter foot.",
      "content": "Position your planter foot. Turn your planter foot (the foot you are not using to kick) so that the inside of your shoe is facing the ball. Remember, your planter foot will point to where the ball ends up. If you want to kick the ball straight ahead, plant that foot facing straight ahead. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Kick a pass on the ground.",
      "content": "Kick a pass on the ground. Follow through with your foot close to the ground. For short passes and passes on the ground, you only need to follow through a few feet. Don't lift your foot far off the ground. [3] X Research source Notice the spin on the ball. An inside of the foot pass should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, you need to lock your ankle, or you might have moved your passing leg in the right trajectory."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick a pass in the air.",
      "content": "Kick a pass in the air. Lean your body back and follow through with your foot in the air. This time, extend your foot fully, and follow through so that your foot ends up several feet in the air. Make sure that if you're passing in the air, you keep your foot closer to the ground than you would for a ground pass so that the ball will go into the air. [4] X Research source Again, notice the spin on the ball. Just like a pass on the ground, a pass in the air should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, make sure you're locking your ankle and watching your passing leg."

    {
      "title": "Take a few steps back.",
      "content": "Take a few steps back. Do you ever watch soccer players take a corner kick or penalty kick ? Soccer players line up only a few steps behind the ball. You don't need to get a running start from 15 feet (4.6 m) away to strike the ball well. In fact, getting a 15 foot (4.6 m) running start will probably keep you from hitting the ball well.

    {
      "title": "Lock your ankle.",
      "content": "Lock your ankle. This keeps your foot stable so that it doesn't move when it contacts the ball. The foot needs to control how the ball moves, rather than the ball moving the foot. If you're trying to achieve a no-spin shot, the only way you'll be able to is by locking your ankle. If the foot is flimsy, the ball will make equally flimsy movements and motions. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Shoot the ball",
      "content": "Shoot the ball using the top of your foot, on the laces. Never use your toe to kick the ball. Toe-kicking the ball makes it impossible to control where you want to put it. And accuracy is the most important thing you need when shooting the ball. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Position your planter foot.",
      "content": "Position your planter foot. Your planter foot is the foot you're not kicking with, the foot that you plant next to the ball. It should be pointed in the direction you want the ball to go. You should also bend your foot and kick the ball with your toe pointed down at the ground. There's a sweet spot on your foot, halfway up your laces, that you should try to use to drive the ball every time. Don't try to kick the ball too hard, and remember to keep your eyes on the ball the whole time."

    {
      "title": "Follow through on your kick.",
      "content": "Follow through on your kick. Make sure your toe is pointed toward the ground. The power of your kick might send both of your feet off the ground as you shoot. Bring your leg back to generate force. You'll get speed and power. If you want to kick a long way, jump at the end while kicking the ball. This will give it your kick even more force."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understand how your lean affects the shot.",
      "content": "Understand how your lean affects the shot. Remember that the farther you lean back as you kick, the higher the ball will get. If your body is straight (vertical) when you kick, you should get a shot that's low to the ground or mid-height. If done correctly, the ball should have no spin once you've kicked it, like a knuckleball shot. If it's spinning outside in, you might have moved your passing leg in the right trajectory or didn't lock your ankle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Land on your shooting foot.",
      "content": "Land on your shooting foot. You should jump and leap through the ball as you strike it. Keep your head down. Your knee should be above the ball while you keep your hips pointed in the direction you want the ball to go. [8] X Research source This approach is used to gain more power behind the ball."

      "title": "Hook the ball.",
      "content": "Hook the ball. To hook the ball, hit it on the inside of your foot, but slightly turn your foot forward as you kick the ball. Your foot should be at a 45 degree angle when you follow through."

      "title": "Slice the ball.",
      "content": "Slice the ball. To slice the ball, hit it on the outside of your foot, with your foot trailing away from the ball as you strike it. This time, your foot should be at a 45 degree angle facing the other way (compared to a hook) when you follow through."

      "content": "Chip the ball . In order to chip the ball, bring your foot down onto the ball and don't follow through that much (if at all). You want to strike the ball right under the tip of your shoe, without using your toe. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Kick the ball while sitting down.",
      "content": "Kick the ball while sitting down. Lightly kick the ball out of your hands with the top of one foot. Lock your ankles. When your foot connects with the ball, the ball should connect with the \"laces\" part of your foot, or where the laces would be if you were wearing cleats. The ball should only go up a couple feet, with little or no spin. Try connecting with your dominant foot first, and then alternate to your non-dominant foot. Skilled soccer players can kick the ball just as well with their non-dominant foot as they can with their dominant one."

      "content": "Practice your kick standing up. Now that you've practiced kicking while sitting down, it's time to practice while standing up. Again, try to kick the ball up only a couple feet, with little spin. Stand up and do the same thing. Drop the ball over your foot and kick up gently. Practice your coordination here. Again, look for no spin in the ball when you kick it up."
