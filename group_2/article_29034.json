      "title": "Pick out a green headband.",
      "content": "Pick out a green headband. You can use any shade of green, but ensure that the headband is comfortable or your kiddo won't want to wear it! If you can't find a green headband, consider wrapping a green ribbon around a black headband and gluing it in place. [1] X Research source Use a sturdy headband that's not made of fabric. Flexible headbands will slide around too much and won't support the felt frog eyes. Instead, use a plastic or metal headband."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut 2 pieces of green felt into figure-8 shapes.",
      "content": "Cut 2 pieces of green felt into figure-8 shapes. Draw 2 connected circles on each piece of green felt. Each circle should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter and they should be touching on 1 side. Then, cut out the circles, but keep them connected where they meet. Repeat this for the other piece of fabric. [2] X Research source The middle of the piece where the circles meet should be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze hot glue on each piece of felt and fold it over the headband.",
      "content": "Squeeze hot glue on each piece of felt and fold it over the headband. Carefully squirt hot glue onto 1 circle of each felt piece. Set the top of the headband in the middle of the felt piece and fold the circle over so it lines up with the other circle. Press the circles so the glue seals them shut. [3] X Research source Remember to position each felt piece slightly off to the side of the headband since these will form your frog's eyes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create 2 white eyeballs to glue onto each green eye.",
      "content": "Create 2 white eyeballs to glue onto each green eye. Cut out 2 circles with 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameters from the white felt. You'll also need to cut out 2 small black dots that will make the pupils of the eyes. Hot glue these onto the center of each white circle before gluing each eyeball onto the green eyes. [4] X Research source If you don't want to use hot glue, use fabric glue and let the pieces dry completely. To create Kermit the Frog eyes, glue a thin black rectangle of felt directly over each pupil."

    {
      "title": "Trace 2 webbed feet onto orange felt.",
      "content": "Trace 2 webbed feet onto orange felt. Have your child place their hands on the felt and use a pencil or chalk to trace around their fingers. Go back with the chalk and draw a small curved line between each of the knuckles to create a webbed effect. The chalk or pencil won't be visible once you cut out the felt. If you don't want to use orange, try a dark shade of green."

    {
      "title": "Cut out the webbed feet and use them to trace 2 more pieces of felt.",
      "content": "Cut out the webbed feet and use them to trace 2 more pieces of felt. Remember to cut along the webbed line you drew between the fingers. Then, place the cut pieces onto a piece of green felt. Trace around the cut pieces, but add an extra 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 inch (0.64 cm) to create an edge for the feet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut out the bottom pieces of felt and leave fabric to cover the wrists.",
      "content": "Cut out the bottom pieces of felt and leave fabric to cover the wrists. Cut along the line you just traced, but don't cut horizontally across the wrists. Instead, cut down along the wrists by 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). This will create a small square of fabric that you'll attach to shirt sleeves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Glue the orange felt onto the green felt.",
      "content": "Glue the orange felt onto the green felt. Squeeze fabric glue or hot glue onto the orange felt pieces and place them directly onto the green felt pieces. Press them in place and let them dry completely. Use caution when working with the hot glue because it can easily burn your skin."

    {
      "title": "Sew or glue the felt feet into the sleeves of a green shirt.",
      "content": "Sew or glue the felt feet into the sleeves of a green shirt. Find a long-sleeved shirt and tuck the wrists of the webbed feet into the ends of the sleeves. Then, stitch or glue the green felt of the feet into the sleeves. When your child slips the shirt on and puts their arms through the sleeves, the felt feet should cover their hands."

    {
      "title": "Get your child to put on a green pair of pants and a green shirt.",
      "content": "Get your child to put on a green pair of pants and a green shirt. Have your child put on the shirt with the webbed feet coming out of the sleeves and dress them in green pants. If the shirt has a printed design or image, cut a circular piece of green or white felt and glue it onto the front of the shirt. This will hide the original design and look like a frog's belly. For a cute frog, you can put your kiddo in a green dress instead of the shirt and pants."

      "title": "Give your child a mask to wear if they don't want a frog headband.",
      "content": "Give your child a mask to wear if they don't want a frog headband. Some kids don't like the feeling of wearing a headband, so you may want to make a mask for them to wear instead. You could cut a mask out of green felt and tie it around their head with a piece of ribbon, for instance. For a mask they can hold up to their face, paint a paper plate green and cut out holes for the eyes. Draw or paint a mouth and nose along with any spots your frog might have. To make it easier to hold the paper mask, glue a popsicle stick or chopstick to the back of the paper plate."

      "title": "Spread green face paint over your child's face and add spots.",
      "content": "Spread green face paint over your child's face and add spots. You can use green makeup or costume face paint to cover their face with green. If you're going for a realistic-looking frog, use a few different shades of green around the eyes, chin, and cheeks. Then, use black or dark green makeup or face paint to add a few spots or speckles across the cheeks. Make the spots any size you like. [5] X Research source Depending on the type of frog, you might want to highlight their cheeks or eyes with bright yellow."

      "title": "Add a green tutu or crown.",
      "content": "Add a green tutu or crown. Make your froggy feel extra special by fastening a fluffy green tutu around their waist. To turn your kid into a frog prince or princess, glue a little yellow crown onto the top of the headband and let them carry a small scepter. Sometimes kids just like to raid the dress up bin. Don't be surprised if your little frog also wants to carry a sword, medical kit, or fishing pole, for instance."
