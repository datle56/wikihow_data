      "title": "Go through your stuff to find things you won’t need.",
      "content": "Go through your stuff to find things you won’t need. Look through all of your clothes, books, toys, and other random objects and decide what to keep and what to sell. If you haven’t worn an item of clothing for a year, or if you’ve read a book and don’t think you’ll ever read it again, you can probably sell it and do more with the money than with the object. Don’t sell things you are still attached to, or know that your parents are attached to. You might regret it later, and it most likely won’t be worth the money."

      "content": "Sell old toys and knick-knacks online. If you have a fortune in Legos tucked away in a closet, try selling them, or any other miscellaneous things you no longer need. You can use Facebook Marketplace or eBay to pawn off the junk you don’t need by posting a listing and shipping the goods or having the buyer stop by to pick them up. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Offer your old clothes on a clothes-selling app or website.",
      "content": "Offer your old clothes on a clothes-selling app or website. What may seem like a trashy t-shirt to you may be a fashion statement for someone else. While websites like Craigslist or eBay will work, too, many young people have found a more niche audience on clothes-selling apps like Poshmark, Tradesy, thredUP, and Depop. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Take your books to a used bookstore.",
      "content": "Take your books to a used bookstore. Many bookstores will purchase your old books for a fraction of the cover price. While giving them 1 or 2 books may only get you a bit of change, bringing in a full box can mean getting $20, $60, or even $100 in cash. [3] X Research source The bookstore will most likely off you store credit at a much higher percentage, but you would only be able to spend it at that bookstore. You should always take cash, unless you have a list of books you already need to buy, with a similar price tag. Powell’s Books, a bookstore headquartered in Portland, Oregon, allows you to mail your books from anywhere in the world for a PayPal deposit."

      "content": "Take glass bottles and aluminum cans into convenience stores. If you live in a place that collects bottle and can deposits, you can collect your soda bottles and cans and return them to a collection spot and receive cash. While you will only get 5 to 10 cents per bottle or can, this amount can add up to give you some good pocket change. [4] X Research source You can also ask your friends, family, and neighbors for theirs as well, to up your return. Ten US states and Guam collect bottle deposits. The 10 states are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont."

      "content": "Join a site like Fiverr so you can do tasks for a small fee. In the digital age, there are many ways to make money online. One way to advertise your skills, like writing or drawing, and make money doing them online is to sign up for freelancing sites to put up an ad for your service and establish a low rate so you can make a little bit of money each time you do it.

      "content": "Find adults in your neighborhood who need babysitters for their kids. Ask your neighbors with children if they are looking for a babysitter and post flyers at coffee shops, and any other local hubs. You can emphasize your experience with younger siblings or cousins if you have any. [6] X Research source Be sure to set an hourly rate ahead of time."

      "content": "Advertise your pet care services if you enjoy being around animals. Dog walkers and pet sitters are often in demand. If you have experience with pets, you can find many neighbors who will be willing to let you take their dog for a walk a few times a week, or check in on their cat a few times a day over a long weekend. [7] X Research source There are also apps like Wag! and Rover where you can accept dog walk requests and make a few dollars. You’ll need to be 18 years or older to use these apps, however."

      "title": "Offer your yard work services.",
      "content": "Offer your yard work services. There is a long tradition of students getting paid to do yard work, because almost no one enjoys mowing the lawn or raking leaves. Try a site like Nextdoor, or post ads on a local bulletin board. You can also offer plant watering and weeding services if you have helped out in the garden before. [8] X Research source If you don’t have the right lawn tools, ask if you can use theirs. This will also keep you from having to lug around a lawnmower or leaf blower everywhere. Ask your neighbors if they want someone to shovel snow for them if you live in a snowy place. Request a small per-session fee and set it up so you can go out early before school all winter."

      "content": "Put up flyers offering a cleaning service. Whether it’s car washes or house cleaning, your neighbors might be thrilled to pay for a thorough cleaning at prices lower than most car washes or house-keeping services. Make sure you do a good job so that they will ask for you to come back again. [9] X Research source Some people may be wary of your ability to clean, so let them know exactly what you will do and show that you know how to get the job done with pictures and recommendations."

      "content": "Try out a part-time job with a flexible schedule. If you feel prepared to juggle your school work and a job, there are many part-time jobs that are available to high school and college students. You can work on weekends, after classes, or between them. Many college students have enough time between classes to fit a quick work shift in. Some high schools allow students to take a period off in their junior or senior year to fit an hour or two of work experience into their day."

      "title": "See if your school has any open positions.",
      "content": "See if your school has any open positions. If you are in college, there may be quite a few open positions that won’t even force you to commute. Ask your career center about paid tutoring opportunities, note-taking positions, student resource jobs, office assistant positions, and anything else your school relies on students to help out with. [10] X Research source You may be able to work multiple shifts throughout the day at the same on-campus job if your classes are in the middle of the day, for instance."

    {
      "title": "Ask friends if their workplace is hiring.",
      "content": "Ask friends if their workplace is hiring. Friends who have jobs off-campus may know whether the restaurant, store, office, or other place of work is hiring. Ask if there are any positions that are open. Another benefit of this is the chance of carpooling or working with a friend. [11] X Research source Be sure to consider whether your friend seems to have a good reputation at their workplace. If they are seen as a slacker, it may not help you to mention that you are their friend when you apply."

      "title": "Look around on bulletin boards.",
      "content": "Look around on bulletin boards. Stop by bulletin boards in and near your school, whether at student centers or coffee shops nearby. Employers looking for students will often post job ads on these boards, expecting students to find them and reach out. Check regularly to make sure you see new postings as soon as they are up."

      "title": "Check job hunting websites.",
      "content": "Check job hunting websites . Go on a reputable job website like the Craigslist jobs section, Monster, Indeed, or SimplyHired and enter keywords for the kind of work you are looking for. You can even include “student” to see if there are job descriptions that mention students specifically. [12] X Research source Always look for jobs a little in advance of when you want to start. If you are on the hunt for a summer job, check the month before school ends and local employers will have lots of jobs with “seasonal” or “summer” in the name. Be sure to check the minimum requirements when looking for a job online. Many places will make it clear whether they are looking for students or not by requiring certain degrees."

      "content": "Open a savings account and use it. Getting a savings account will not only give you a safe place to keep your money and track its growth easily, it will very slowly grow the longer you keep money in it, and the more money that it holds. You can start it off by putting money you have laying around into the account, and then put a fraction of what you make in a month into it. You should make sure not to get an account that has a minimum balance amount or a monthly fee, as this can actually cause you to lose money. If you are in high school, you’ll probably need your parents’ permission to get a savings account, and even if you’re a college student, you might consider asking what banks they suggest."

      "title": "Take the bus or walk instead of driving or using a rideshare app.",
      "content": "Take the bus or walk instead of driving or using a rideshare app. Both gas and Uber or Lyft trips are expensive. If you find yourself spending all your money on getting around, see if you can save by taking the bus, or whatever transit system your area has. Walking is even cheaper, and if you can get around easily on foot, you’ll save money with every step."

      "content": "Shop at clearance sections and thrift stores. If you tend to spend a lot of money on clothes, you can reduce your spending looking at clearance sections at your favorite stores, or even trying out a thrift store. You might be surprised at the quality of what you can find at a used clothing store, including new items that didn’t fit someone else."

      "content": "Sign up for a grocery store savings card. Many grocery stores offer a membership card that you can purchase for a low to moderate price that can save you hundreds or thousands on groceries over time. They work by giving members a discount on certain items that change throughout the month. You can get these items for cheaper than the listed price that someone without a membership would pay. You can also ask if your family already has savings cards at any grocery stores and then use your family’s membership number or phone number to get the discount."
