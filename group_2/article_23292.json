  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Look for a pronounced preference to work alone.",
      "content": "Look for a pronounced preference to work alone. People with schizoid personality disorder tend to prefer solitary work. They often choose mechanical or technical fields, like math or computer programming, which can be performed individually. They are typically “followers,” and shy away from leadership roles. Common careers include lab or library work and nighttime jobs, like security. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Identify a strong lack of motivation.",
      "content": "Identify a strong lack of motivation. One of the symptoms of schizoid PD is a lack of desire to make or achieve goals. People with this disorder may underperform at school or work. They may be simply going through the mechanics of doing a job or assignment without any clear expectations about the outcome or their own performance. They are overwhelmingly indifferent to both criticism of their work and praise for a job well done. [3] X Research source They rarely exhibit an effort to get promoted or perform better than others. Most are considered highly functional since they are able to keep a job, but do not excel in their fields of study/work."

      "title": "Observe a tendency for excessive fantasizing.",
      "content": "Observe a tendency for excessive fantasizing. Those with this disorder often construct complex fantasy lives in their minds and spend a great deal of time daydreaming. However, they know the difference between this fantasy life and their real life. Such daydreaming likely affects work production and contributes to underperforming."

    {
      "title": "Assess the person’s recreational activities.",
      "content": "Assess the person’s recreational activities. People with this disorder might spend all of their free time engaged in activities they can do alone, like playing computer games or building models. They may also do things alone that most people do in groups or pairs, like go to the movies or a sports game. They typically avoid group activities like sports or social/professional clubs. If they are on a team, they avoid leadership roles and may choose tasks that can be completed or played without assistance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Establish a general lack of affect.",
      "content": "Establish a general lack of affect. People with schizoid PD typically do not express emotions under any circumstances and often don’t seem to have any strong opinions on any topic. They are often described as dull, or superficial. They seem indifferent even in situations where it is inappropriate, such as emergencies or tragedies, or events that most people would be happy about, like the birth of a new family member. They do not respond to emotional expression by others, and may not even recognize such feelings since they do not experience them personally."

    {
      "title": "Assess a persistent lack of ability to blend in socially.",
      "content": "Assess a persistent lack of ability to blend in socially. People with schizoid PD are often described as \"odd\" or \"different\" because they do not respond to normal social cues, like emotive statements or loaded political issues, like the majority of people. They have difficulty relating to others in everyday situations and therefore may be extremely reserved. [4] X Research source Their personality differences are often expressed as “eccentric” because responses are inconsistent with normal social behavior, but not usually completely unrelated."

      "title": "Consider the person's age when assessing symptoms.",
      "content": "Consider the person's age when assessing symptoms. Adults are more likely to be diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder because their symptoms will be well-established. However, a child or teen may be diagnosed if the symptoms have lasted for more than one year. [5] X Research source Also, keep in mind that even though schizoid personality disorder can affect men and women, men are more frequently diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder than women."

      "title": "Evaluate the person’s friendships.",
      "content": "Evaluate the person’s friendships. People with schizoid PD generally have few, if any, friends and don’t seek out friendships. Any friendships they do have are mostly superficial, lacking any emotional connection. Generally, people with this disorder show no interest in making friends or engaging in close relationships. Competing theories suggest some people with schizoid PD may desire close relationships, but find it easier to be alone than try to fit social expectations."

      "title": "Note an avoidance of romantic relationships.",
      "content": "Note an avoidance of romantic relationships. People with this disorder usually don’t date exclusively, if at all. They rarely marry and show no interest in sharing their life with others. [6] X Research source They almost always either live alone or continue living with their parents into adulthood. [7] X Research source They show little to no interest in sexual relationships, and do not gain satisfaction from them. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Assess familial relationships.",
      "content": "Assess familial relationships. People with schizoid personality disorder do not develop close relationships even with family, except perhaps for first-degree relatives. [9] X Research source Even these connections are typically structural and not emotionally contingent."

      "content": "Identify a firm grasp on reality. Unlike schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder , those with schizoid personality disorder do not experience hallucinations or unusual paranoia. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While those with schizoid PD tend to have elaborate fantasy lives and daydream about them, they are fully aware that these are fantasies. Fantasy lives and real lives do not blend into each other like they do for those with more severe forms of schizophrenia."

      "content": "Identify an ability to carry on a logical conversation. While people with schizoid PD tend to speak flatly, with a complete lack of emotional expression, they are able to carry on a conversation that others can follow, whereas schizophrenics are not. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Being quiet is a possible sign of schizoid PD, but erratic or dissociative speech may denote a more severe form of schizophrenia. “Eccentric” behavior is defined as slightly odd or uncommon, often in a humorous manner.

Autistic people vary in communication abilities, and may seem awkward and have word-finding problems (although this varies between people). They may talk a lot about their favorite subjects. They also tend to have unusual nonverbal communication, such as not making eye contact, seeming unusually emotional or under-emotional, and stimming ."

      "content": "Evaluate emotional intelligence. People with schizoid PD fail to display any emotions—positive or negative. They may recognize emotions in others, but cannot relate to them and do not know how to respond in a socially acceptable manner. Autistic people may have a hard time figuring out what other people are thinking and feeling, but can be deeply emotional, especially with regards to getting overwhelmed easily."

      "content": "Determine how well the person functions in general. Those with schizoid PD are able to maintain steady employment, unlike people with delusional disorders, like schizophrenia, and cluster B disorders, like antisocial personality disorder. They tend to choose jobs where they work alone, but are generally reliable enough to show up and do the minimal required. [14] X Research source People with antisocial personality disorder cannot hold down a job because they will not follow rules, and often find themselves in legal trouble. Some autistic people have difficulty maintaining steady employment due to a tendency towards overstimulation, difficulty staying organized, and a reduced ability to control particular emotions, especially frustration."

Schizoid PD does not usually present itself until early adulthood, while autistic people usually display signs of autism in childhood, sometimes even as young as age 2.
