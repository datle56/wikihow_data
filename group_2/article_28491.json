      "content": "Pick a time when they’re calm and focused on you. Opening up to your parents can be super stressful, but you can do it! Tell your parents you need to talk to them and suggest a time when you’re both free. Make sure there are no distractions around, such as a TV, so they pay attention to you. [1] X Research source Say, “Mom, I really need to talk to you. Can we sit down together after dinner tonight?” If your parents won’t talk to you, find an adult you trust to confide in, like your grandparent or a school counselor. It’s not fair that your parents are unresponsive, but it probably has nothing to do with you. Chances are, they have struggles of their own. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Start the conversation by asking them to listen and be open-minded.",
      "content": "Start the conversation by asking them to listen and be open-minded. It’s possible your parents have no idea that you feel unloved. They may become defensive or might feel like they need to comfort you once you start opening up. Specify at the beginning of the conversation that what you’re going to say may be hard to hear and that you just want them to listen. [3] X Research source You might say, “I need to talk to you about some problems I’ve been having lately. You might feel upset when you hear what I have to say, but please just listen until I’ve gotten it all out,” or “I really just need you to be there for me right now. I hope you’ll hear me out and try to understand me.”"

      "title": "Tell your parents how you feel.",
      "content": "Tell your parents how you feel. It’s scary to talk about your feelings, but be honest with them. Explain that you feel unloved and why. Then, tell them what you want them to do differently. [4] X Research source You could say, “I feel like you always criticize me and like nothing I do is ever right. I just want you to be proud of me and for you to tell me you love me.\" It may be hard to talk about these things with your parents to begin with, so maybe try talking through your feelings with somebody you trust who will be fair-minded and listen to you.

      "content": "Listen to what your parents have to say in response. After you’ve gotten it all out, give your parents a chance to explain how they feel. Try to understand things from their point of view, but remember that it’s okay to disagree with them. Hopefully, you can find some common ground. [6] X Research source Don’t interrupt your parents while they’re talking because it’ll likely start a fight. If they say something super upsetting, try counting to 10 or picturing your happy place until they’re done talking. If you feel your parents don't love you for who you are, there's likely a reason you feel that way. That doesn't mean your parents really don't love you, but your reason for feeling this way could be valid.

      "title": "Stay calm if your parents start to yell or try to fight.",
      "content": "Stay calm if your parents start to yell or try to fight. You’re probably really upset, so it's only natural to want to yell or fight back. However, this will likely make the situation worse, and you’ll just end up feeling awful. Instead, walk away from the situation if you can. If you can’t leave, picture your happy place or count your breaths to help you relax. [8] X Research source Consider meditating or praying to help you center yourself."

      "content": "Ask your parents about their childhood to better understand them. It’s hard to picture your parents when they were young, but it could help you make sense of their behavior now. Encourage your parents to tell you stories about when they were growing up. Pay attention to the expectations their parents had for them, the struggles your parents had at school, and other issues. [9] X Research source For instance, your parents may pester you about your grades because they wish their parents had pushed them academically. Similarly, your parents may want you to play sports because they loved them, even though you hate sports. You could also learn that your parents didn’t have a great relationship with their own parents. They may just not realize that they’re not showing you love properly. Hopefully, this insight could help you change things with them."

      "content": "Set boundaries with your parents if they don’t treat you well. You deserve to feel loved, but you can’t control your parents’ actions. Decide what bothers you most, then ask your parents to stop these behaviors. Tell them that you will not respond or will walk away when they treat you this way. Start with small changes, and over time you can change your relationship. [10] X Research source Use “I” language so your parents don’t get defensive. For instance, say, “I feel bad when you yell at me, so I’m not going to respond when you yell,” instead of, “You always yell and hurt my feelings.” You could say something like, “I know you don’t agree with my choices, but they’re my decisions. When you criticize me, I’m going to stop listening.”"

      "content": "Show love to your parents so they know you care. It’s really hard to be affectionate with a parent who isn’t giving you the love you need, so only do what feels comfortable to you. Start by telling your parents that you love or appreciate them. Additionally, hug or kiss your parents if that feels right to you. These actions show your parents you love them, which may help them be more affectionate with you. Say something like, \"I love you\" or “I appreciate you.” Do nice things for your parents to show you love them. You could also write them a nice letter or might make them a small gift, such as a painting or photo slideshow. Don’t do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. It’s okay if you don’t want to touch your parents because of how they’ve treated you in the past."

      "content": "Offer to do household chores if you still live at home. Taking care of a home is really hard, and your parents are probably tired after a long day. You likely also have a lot on your plate, but try to find time to help your parents out around the house if you live at home. This creates a sense of unity in your household, which could help improve your relationship with your parents. [11] X Research source For example, offer to wash the dishes if your parents cooked dinner or take out the trash when it fills up. Similarly, you might help with the laundry or lawn care duties."

      "content": "Follow each other on social media to get a peek into your private lives. You probably don’t want your parents poking their nose into your business, but studies show that social media can improve parent-child relationships. Just connect with them over 1 platform where you post things you feel comfortable with them seeing. Take a few moments every day to check what they’re posting and see how they reacted to your posts. [12] X Research source For example, you might post on a Facebook profile that your parents can see. You can even limit what they see if you prefer. It’s okay to save some posts for just your friends."

However, you likely have something in common with your parents, even if it’s super small. Try to find some similarities between you and use them to build a connection with your parents. Keep your conversations focused on your commonalities so you’re less likely to have conflict.
