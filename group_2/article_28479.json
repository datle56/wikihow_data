If you plan on making a lot of clothes, consider investing in a cardboard Pattern Cutting Board. You can use any large piece of cardboard, but Pattern Cutting Boards have grid lines to make measuring easier. Acrylic rulers, also known as quilting rulers, are made especially for cutting fabric. You can buy rolls of tracing paper, or you can use medical exam table paper.

      "title": "Pin your t-shirt to the board.",
      "content": "Pin your t-shirt to the board. Fold your t-shirt in half vertically, with the front half of the t-shirt on the outside. Lay the folded t-shirt on the paper and smooth it out. Use your straight pins to start pinning the seam lines. Keep the pins upright and push them into the cardboard. Use more pins along curved seam lines to get a more accurate measurement."

      "content": "Remove the pins from the t-shirt. Once you've pinned all the way around the shirt, remove the pins and lift the shirt off the paper. You should be able to see the holes you made."

      "title": "Trace your pattern.",
      "content": "Trace your pattern. Mark the holes with your pencil so they're easier to see. Use your ruler to start connecting the dots until you've outlined the entire half of the t-shirt. After you've traced the entire shirt, go back through and round out the corners on the neckline and the armhole. When you've finished tracing your pattern, label it. Include the original garment type, the size, and which piece of the pattern it is. In this case, you measured the front of the shirt. Remember to mark the fold line of your pattern. Make a note to cut one on the fold."

      "title": "Repeat the pinning process for the back of the shirt.",
      "content": "Repeat the pinning process for the back of the shirt. Fold the t-shirt in half, but this time make sure the back of the shirt is on the outside. Lay it on the tracing paper and pin the seams. Remember to mark the fold line and label this piece of the pattern as the back of the shirt. The neckline, armholes, and hemline on the back of the shirt may be a little different than the front. Try to pin accurately so you have good measurements."

      "content": "Pin the sleeves. Pinning the sleeves is a little different than pinning the front and back of the shirt. Flatten the sleeve on the paper and pin the seams. Keep the sleeve as flat as possible. Follow the same tracing process as you did with the front and back of the shirt. When you label the sleeve piece, make a note that you will need to cut two on the fold."

      "title": "Make a neckband pattern.",
      "content": "Make a neckband pattern. Turn your shirt inside out and match up the shoulders. Pin the four corners of the neckband. Place some pins in the center of the neckband as well. Use your ruler to make the neckband piece a rectangle. The neckband is folded in half, so make sure you double the width on your pattern piece. Subtract about an inch from the length of the pattern to account for the stretch of a neckband. Label the pattern piece accordingly, and make a note to cut one on the fold."

      "content": "Cut your pattern out. Cut each piece out around the outer edge. Leave some space so that you are not cutting along the seam allowance lines. You should have a total of four pieces: one sleeve, one front, one back, and a neckband. Make sure each piece is properly labeled. You can store your pattern in a folder or a large envelope."

      "content": "Prepare your fabric. It's a good idea to wash your fabric before you start sewing. Some fabrics will shrink when they're washed, resulting in a poor fit. Washing beforehand will prevent this. [2] X Research source Think about what type of fabric you want to make your t-shirt from. Fabrics fall into two basic categories. There are knit fabrics and woven fabrics. Most shirts use a knit fabric, which is softer than woven fabric. [3] X Research source Knit fabrics stretch easier than woven fabrics, making them a little more difficult to work with. However, the added stretch of knit makes for a more breathable garment. Press your fabric after you wash and dry it. You want the fabric to be as smooth as possible before you start working with it.
