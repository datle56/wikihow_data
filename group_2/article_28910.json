      "content": "Poke a hole through the center of a Styrofoam ball . Use a skewer , knitting needle , or screwdriver to pierce a hole through the ball's middle. Pull your long tool out of the ball gently, so you’re left with a long hole through the center of the Styrofoam. [1] X Research source The size of the Styrofoam ball doesn’t matter—pick whatever size you’d like! Just keep in mind that the smaller the ball, the smaller your CD tile pieces will have to be."

      "title": "Slide a folded piece of wire through the hole you created.",
      "content": "Slide a folded piece of wire through the hole you created. [2] X Research source Cut a piece of craft wire that’s twice as long as your Styrofoam ball using wire cutters or scissors. Fold the wire in half and thread it through the ball’s hole. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of looped wire outside the ball. The looped wire sticking out will help you hang your DIY disco ball later. The thinner gauge wire you use, the easier it’ll be to slide through."

    {
      "title": "Twist the looped wire into place with a pencil to make a hook.",
      "content": "Twist the looped wire into place with a pencil to make a hook. Widen the looped wire with your fingers, and slide a pencil through it. Spin the pencil around to wrap and secure the loop and wire in place. Remove the pencil after twisting it at least 3 times. If you don’t have a pencil on hand, try using a pen or the long tool you used to poke a hole in the Styrofoam ball (skewer, long knitting needle, or screwdriver)."

    {
      "title": "Fold over the excess wire on the end without the hook.",
      "content": "Fold over the excess wire on the end without the hook. Gently tug on the opposite end of the wire (the one without a loop) until the loop is flush against the top of the Styrofoam ball. Push one end of the wire to the left and the other to the right. This will keep your disco ball from sliding off its loop. Add a dab of hot glue or super glue to the wire ends for a stronger hold."

      "title": "Paint the Styrofoam ball",
      "content": "Paint the Styrofoam ball silver to make it look more realistic. Use Styrofoam-friendly spray paint or acrylic paint . This step isn’t necessary, but can help conceal the Styrofoam if there are any gaps between your tiles. [3] X Research source For an extra layer of sparkle, use a glitter silver or metallic paint . The acetone in spraypaint can melt Styrofoam, so look for paints that are mostly water- or alcohol-based, like Liquitex Spray Paint and MTA Water Based . [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Boil a pot of water to dip your CDs in. CDs can be hard to break and cut on their own, but a little heat can make them more malleable. Fill a pot with water and set it on the stove at high heat. Wait for the water to start bubbling. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a pair of tongs to dip the CDs into the boiling water. Remove the pot from the heat. Press the CD between the tongs and submerge it in the water for a few seconds. Don’t let it touch the bottom of the pot. Pull the CD out when you notice the edges curling in. [6] X Research source Recycle old, scratched, or broken CDs for this DIY project. [7] X Research source Use all silver CDs for a realistic disco ball or opt for an array of colors for a groovier vibe. Work with one CD at a time. The CD will become hard again once it cools, so boil each CD one at a time, so you have time to cut them while they’re warm."

Start at one edge of the CD and cut vertically towards the center. [8] X Research source Use your hands to wiggle stubborn pieces away from the disc. Avoid using CDs that peel when you cut them, as they won’t give the same mosaic, disco ball effect. Put on a pair of gloves if the CDs are too warm in your hands."

These will be the “mirrors” of your disco ball. [9] X Research source Consider omitting the curved edges of the CD strips if you want each mirror piece to be uniform. For a more decorative mosaic look, cut the disc into different-sized squares or triangles."

Dab a dot of hot glue onto the back of a CD tile piece, and quickly press it against the Styrofoam. Start in the center and work your way around the ball. [10] X Research source Line the tiles up so that their edges touch and they’re flush with each other for a classic, uniform look. Keep a small space between each tile for a mosaic-style disco ball.
