      "title": "College is more challenging and exciting than high school.",
      "content": "College is more challenging and exciting than high school. The classes are tougher, the readings are longer, and you have to learn how to study and manage your time independently. But you’ll also get to choose what to study, which means you’ll take classes in subjects that really interest you. Best of all, you’ll have a chance to make new friends who share your passions and interests. It’s no wonder so many people feel like college was the best time in their lives! College really has something for everyone. You’ll have lots of opportunities to make friends by joining clubs, playing sports, or attending events on campus. As long as you go to class, do your work, and ask for help when you need it, you’ll stand an excellent chance of succeeding. Living independently can be hard at first, but you’ll get used to it over time. Everyone you’ll meet will be in the same boat, so don’t fret."

      "content": "Your classes will be harder—but way more interesting. The readings are tougher and longer, and the material is usually more complex. But on the other hand, the material can be fascinating. Some of your professors might be experts in their fields, and you and your classmates will have a chance to ask them all kinds of questions. Of course, not all classes will be super hard. As with high school, some classes—and some professors—are easier than others."

      "title": "You’ll get to decide what to study.",
      "content": "You’ll get to decide what to study. In most colleges, this means picking a major. You can major in anything from English, to art history, to electrical engineering. You can even change your major if you don’t like what you’re studying. It’s up to you! Different colleges and universities offer different majors. Check the websites of the colleges you’re interested in to find out which majors are available, or have a chat with your high school guidance counselor. They’ll advise you on which colleges offer which majors. Many colleges still have a list of “required courses” that everyone has to take. These might include history, English composition, and a basic science course, among others. It all depends on the college."

      "title": "Your classes will look and feel different.",
      "content": "Your classes will look and feel different. Ever sat in a movie theater? Picture that, but with 100 students sitting around you and a professor standing at a podium at the front. That’s how some of your classes will be! Other classes, like advanced language courses, might be tiny and highly interactive, with just a few students working closely with the professor. It all depends on the class, the professor, and the subject being taught. In really big classes, the professor may have graduate students called teaching assistants—or “T.A.s” for short. T.A.s are often younger and more relaxed than the professor, so they’re a great resource if you have any questions or need extra help."

      "title": "You’ll make your own schedule.",
      "content": "You’ll make your own schedule. Not a morning person? Pick an afternoon English seminar. Laundry’s piling up? Head down to the laundry room at 1:00am and wash your clothes. No one’s gonna stop you, and that’s the fun. You study when you want, take classes when you want, and do chores when you need to. No one tells you what to do. Most dorms have laundry rooms where you can wash your clothes for a fee, and common spaces have sinks where you can wash dishes."

      "title": "You’ll become more disciplined and self-motivated.",
      "content": "You’ll become more disciplined and self-motivated. Over time, you’ll become a natural at studying for exams, doing homework, and taking good notes. You’ll learn how to read faster and understand complicated material more easily. You’ll become better and better at studying over time. As with any skill, the more you practice, the more you’ll succeed."

      "title": "You’ll have tons of extracurriculars to choose from.",
      "content": "You’ll have tons of extracurriculars to choose from. Some colleges have literally dozens of student-run organizations: sports teams, science clubs, choirs, prayer groups, fraternities, sororities, student government, you name it. You can even start a club, or join the leadership team of a club that already exists. In some cases, you can even join organizations that are not directly affiliated with your school, like a local volunteer group in town."

      "title": "You’ll have to find a way to pay for your education.",
      "content": "You’ll have to find a way to pay for your education. Unfortunately, college costs money, but don’t worry. There are lots of ways to pay for school. Scholarships, grants, student loans, federal financial aid, state financial aid (if you attend school in your home state), and work-study programs can all help cover the cost. Ask about financial aid when you apply to a college. Most colleges and universities have financial aid officers whose sole job is to help students pay for school. Your high school guidance counselor can also help you decide which schools are more affordable."

      "title": "College is necessary for some careers.",
      "content": "College is necessary for some careers. The truth is that many jobs require at least an undergraduate degree. Others even require additional degrees, like a master’s. While getting an undergraduate degree doesn’t guarantee a specific career or level of income, it’ll dramatically improve your chances of finding a job that suits your talents and pays well. A bachelor’s degree sets you up to obtain higher degrees later on. For example, you may work as a banker for several years after college, before going to law school or business school."

      "content": "College isn’t for everyone, and that’s OK. If you have no interest in school, attending college may not be worth it. Plus, some professions, like medical assistants and computer support socialists, don’t always require college degrees. [1] X Research source While your career options may be limited without college, it’s ultimately up to you to decide whether a college degree is worth the time, money, and effort. When in doubt, talk to a guidance counselor, college admissions officer, or even one of your teachers. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of attending college."

      "title": "You can delay going to college if you’re not ready.",
      "content": "You can delay going to college if you’re not ready. Not every college graduate goes to college directly from high school. Some people take a gap year to work or travel. Others attempt careers in sports or the arts, or even enlist in the military. Explore other options if you’re not sure what to do! Traveling abroad is easier when you’re younger. It can also give you valuable life experience, which you can take with you to college and beyond. [2] X Research source Many servicemembers and veterans of the U.S. military receive tuition assistance, meaning that part or all of their college education is paid for after a certain amount of time served.

      "title": "Start with an easy course load.",
      "content": "Start with an easy course load. Pick 1-2 hard courses, then add electives. For instance, if you’re majoring in math, pick a difficult class that’s required by your school’s math department. Then fill the rest of your schedule with electives or other required courses. By minimizing your workload in the beginning, you’ll have an easier time adjusting to your new environment. This makes it more likely that you’ll succeed academically."

      "content": "Don’t take morning classes if you’re not a morning person. Not a member of the 5:00am club? Or even the 10:00am club? Then don’t bother registering for an 8:00am English seminar—you’ll just sleep through it. Of course, if you’re a true morning person, give it a shot. But don’t be surprised if your classmates don’t always show up! Sometimes, a class will only be offered at an inconvenient time. Other classes won’t be offered every semester. Do your best to create a schedule that works for you. Talk to an academic advisor to plan your schedule. They can advise you about which classes to take. [4] X Research source"

Designate blocks of time each week for studying, doing labs, writing papers, and so on. [5] X Research source By planning your semester carefully, you can keep track of everything on your plate while ensuring you have enough time for a social life. [6] X Research source Use Google Calendar , Apple Calendar , or a similar calendar app if you prefer to keep things digital. Apps also let you set reminders for deadlines, upcoming events, and more."

      "content": "Practice good study habits. Attend every class. This helps you stay connected to your coursework. Choose a time and place to study that’s free of distractions. [7] X Research source If you can’t attend class for any reason, let your professors know. They’ll often try to work with you, especially if you miss class due to physical illness, mental health, or family issues."

      "content": "Seek tutoring or join study groups. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it! It’s always a good idea, whether you’re struggling in a class or just trying to gain an extra edge. [8] X Research source Many colleges and universities have tutors in multiple subjects. Study groups can be great—especially for subjects like foreign languages, where conversation practice is important to your grade."

Sometimes, they can even help you obtain internships or employment down the line. [9] X Research source If your classes have Teaching Assistants—or “T.As.,”—talk to them too. Most of them will be graduate students or undergraduates with extensive knowledge of the course. They can be a great resource when you have questions or need extra help."

      "content": "Do more than just academics. Join clubs, play sports, make friends, and explore your identity. If Greek life appeals to you, join a fraternity or sorority. Try out for the crew team or write for the campus newspaper. Join a prayer group. Run for student government. Attend your first drag show. Find the activities, people, and communities that you connect with—whatever those are. There’s way more to college than papers and exams! [10] X Research source Many campus groups will advertise events through newsletters, flyers, and information tables during your initial orientation and throughout the academic year."
