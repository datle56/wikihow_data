      "title": "Missed period",
      "content": "Missed period The hormone changes of pregnancy cause the menstrual cycle to stop completely. You probably don’t know the ins and outs of your partner's period, and that’s okay! Chances are, they've mentioned it off-hand in a conversation before, or you’ve noticed them stashing some extra tampons or pads before an outing or trip. If they haven't mentioned their period in over a month, there’s a chance that they missed it completely. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source These are good clues to watch out for, but they aren’t irrefutable proof that your partner is pregnant. Some people like their privacy and may not share any details about their period when it comes around. At the start of a pregnancy, someone may “spot,” or lightly bleed from their vagina. This is easy to mix up with a regular period, but it’s actually a key sign of a successful pregnancy. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Tender breasts Pregnancy-related hormone changes may cause your partner's breasts to feel sore. Notice if they complains about their chest feeling a bit sore or tingly. Just keep in mind that tender breasts are also a common side effect of periods, too. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source"

      "title": "Headaches",
      "content": "Headaches Big hormone shifts in early pregnancy can lead to nasty headaches. The occasional headache isn’t anything to worry about, but frequent headaches could signify something bigger in the works. Try to count how many headaches they have in a week, and see if that number is higher than usual. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In addition to headaches, hormone changes can cause some people to also feel a bit lightheaded. Keep in mind that headaches are really common and can mean a lot of different things. If headaches are the only real change you notice in your partner, pregnancy probably isn’t the cause. You could say something like, “Wow, you’ve had a lot of headaches this week. Are you feeling okay?”"

      "title": "Tiredness",
      "content": "Tiredness Increased hormone production leaves pregnant people feeling extra sleepy. During pregnancy, the body produces a ton of progesterone, which causes the person to feel pretty exhausted. With this in mind, see if your partner feels more tired than usual, or if they take more naps than they typically do. [5] X Research source It’s important to note that fatigue is a very common side effect that’s connected with a variety of different health issues, like anemia, stress, and anxiety disorders. [6] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 383 wikiHow readers about signs of pregnancy, and 56% of them agreed that they usually attribute feeling tired to a lack of sleep or poor sleep quality .

      "content": "Bloating An uncomfortable bloating feeling can be a sign of pregnancy. As you spend time together, see if your partner complains about having a stomachache or something similar. Bloating usually happens during the early weeks of pregnancy, so it’s a good warning sign to look out for. [7] X Research source Bloating on its own isn’t necessarily a pregnancy sign. Some people also feel bloated right before their period begins again. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "title": "Repeated bathroom trips",
      "content": "Repeated bathroom trips Pregnant people have to pee frequently at the beginning of their pregnancy. During pregnancy, the body creates extra blood, which gets processed through the kidneys. This extra blood leads to extra waste, which turns into extra pee. If your partner seems to be taking way more bathroom breaks than usual, there could be something else at play. [9] X Research source Keep other factors in mind, too. For instance, your partner might head to the bathroom a little more frequently if they just chugged a glass of water."

      "content": "Moodiness Pregnancy-related hormone changes may impact their overall mood. Pay close attention to how your partner acts around you. Is their mood pretty consistent, or do they get moody for no apparent reason? While the occasional bad mood is no big deal, frequent mood swings could be a cause for concern.

      "title": "Food cravings",
      "content": "Food cravings Some people crave random foods when they’re pregnant. There’s no real rhyme or reason to this, and there’s no consistent food that they crave, either. Some might prefer sweets, like ice cream, candy, and chocolate, while others prefer more savory foods, like fish. See if your partner starts eating a certain type of food more than normal–that could be a sign that’s something up. [11] X Research source Pregnancy cravings can also involve really weird food combos, like cheese-wrapped pickles. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Food aversions",
      "content": "Food aversions Random foods might seem completely disgusting. Some foods become completely unappetizing to pregnant people, with coffee, tea, spicy dishes, fatty dishes, eggs, and meat being common offenders. If your partner suddenly doesn’t want to eat foods they normally like, it could be a sign of something bigger. [13] X Research source Food aversions alone definitely aren’t solid proof of pregnancy. For example, they might not be in the mood to eat eggs and toast, but that doesn’t mean they hate eating eggs all of the sudden."

      "title": "Smell sensitivity",
      "content": "Smell sensitivity Pregnant people are often extra sensitive to different smells. Whether you’re cooking, enjoying takeout, or lighting a scented candle, see how they react to a variety of scents. Pregnant people tend to have a more potent sense of smell, and may comment when something smells a little strong. [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source There isn’t a lot of scientific evidence to back this up, but many pregnant people agree that it’s true. [15] X Research source You might say something like, “Your sense of smell is way better than mine. I never would’ve noticed that if you hadn’t said something!”"

      "title": "Pregnancy test",
      "content": "Pregnancy test An at-home pregnancy test is the best way to confirm if your partner is pregnant. These tests work by testing urine for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that’s only produced during pregnancy. Sit down with your partner and see if they'd be comfortable taking one of these at-home tests. Explain to them that you’ll both have more time to consider your options if they take the test early on. [16] X Research source Pregnancy tests are sold at pharmacies and most big-name retail stores. [17] X Research source [v161948_b01]. 15 September 2021. Some tests cost less than $5. It's best to take a pregnancy test in the morning. [18] X Research source [v161948_b01]. 15 September 2021. Your partner can either dip the test in a cup of their urine or use an eyedropper applicator to draw up the urine and put it on the designated area on the tip of the test. [19] X Research source [v161948_b01]. 15 September 2021. Let your partner know that you love and support them and that the decision to take a pregnancy test is completely their decision. You might say, “I know that this is scary, but you’re not alone in any of this. Whatever you decide to do, I’ll support you 100%.”"

      "content": "Feeling hot Pregnant people feel warmer on a day-to-day basis. During pregnancy, the body naturally makes more blood, which causes the blood vessels to get a little wider.
