      "content": "Bend at your knees to get into a slight squat position and spread them cheeks. Your hips should be about hip distance apart. The dance is usually performed with a slight bend to the knee, but how far you bend down is up to you! [2] X Research source You can place your feet parallel to each other or step one foot out to the front. It’s easier to start with your feet facing the front and then mix it up once you master the moves."

      "content": "Swing your arms back and forth. Swish them at your sides or swing them in front and behind your body. Move them along with the beat. [3] X Research source At first, you might just move your arms at your sides. As you get better at the dance, alternate swinging them front to back."

      "content": "Thrust your pelvis forward and back while moving your arms. You can move your pelvis front and back only, or you can step from side-to-side with your pelvic thrusts. This should be a slight, fluid movement with the beat. [4] X Research source The pelvic thrusts are a small movement that almost isn’t noticeable. Just slightly move your hips forward and back."

      "content": "Step side to side. Keep your knees bent, your arms swinging, and your pelvis thrusting. Take very small steps, doing step-together-step. You aren’t trying to move across the dance floor. You just want to give your dance some movement. [5] X Research source Step along to the beat. Start with a side-to-side movement, but it’s okay to move in other directions after you master the moves. For example, you might step to the side, then the front, then the side again. It’s up to you!"

Start in a standing position, then bend your left leg back, lifting your left shoe to your back hip. Then, look at the shoe to see it’s clean."

As you shuffle, press down with your hands. [8] X Research source Start doing the downward hand motions as soon as you start your shuffle. Your right hand will likely be directly in front of your body, while your left arm may be a little to the side of your body. This is because you are moving toward the right as you shuffle."

[14] X Research source The quick punching moves on “pull up” should look similar to turning a steering wheel with 2 quick turns. When doing the muscle pose, you should be tilted toward the right, as your left leg will be lifted off the floor. Make sure both of your arms are lifted above your shoulders and bent at the elbow as though you’re showing off your biceps."
