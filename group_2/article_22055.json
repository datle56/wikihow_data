Self-doubt can be particularly distressing. The following exercises can help you quiet your inner critic and soothe your worries: [2] X Research source Jongsma, A. J., Bruce, T. J., &amp; Peterson, L. M. (2006). The complete adult psychotherapy treatment planner. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Son’s, Inc. If you catch yourself worrying and or thinking negatively about yourself, ask yourself some questions. For example: \"Is this thought kind to myself?\" \"Is this thought true?\" \"Would I say this to someone else?\" The answers to these questions can often help reduce self-doubt. Change a negative thought to make it truer or kinder. [3] X Expert Source Vernita Marsh, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Consultant, & Speaker Expert Interview. 7 April 2022. For example, you might find yourself thinking: “I never get anything right.” Try to make this more truthful by thinking instead: “Sometimes I don’t get things right, but other times I do a really great job. It is ok that I can’t do everything, and I am proud of what I can do.” Remember—you may not have control over what pops into your mind, but you do have control over what you can focus on.

For example, if you might find yourself thinking: “I don’t like not knowing what is going to happen. What if something terrible happens?” In this case, you can remind yourself of your strengths. You might say to yourself: “I do not like not knowing what will happen, but I do know that I have overcome unforeseeable events in the past. I trust my ability to handle whatever comes my way.” Acknowledging what you value about yourself will remind you of your worth, which is essential to mental wellness. Valuing your strengths can remind you of how capable and competent you are. It is helpful to write down your thoughts about your strengths, or even start a journal. Here are some helpful prompts to get you started: What makes you feel strong? Is it something you do, or a certain environment? Describe what you feel in moments of strength. Confidence? Pride?
