      "title": "Use heat to your advantage.",
      "content": "Use heat to your advantage. Applying a heating pad to your pelvis or taking a hot bath can help relax your pelvic muscles and dilate your blood vessels, which can stimulate blood flow and thus speed up your period. [1] X Research source Consider this a reason to draw yourself a hot bath and take a while to soak. Your cramps will feel better and your period may run its course faster – and you get some much needed me-time, too."

      "title": "Exercise regularly.",
      "content": "Exercise regularly. Exercising during your period can help alleviate PMS symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and moodiness. [2] X Research source Many people find that getting regular physical exercise can also help manage the heaviness and duration of their periods in the long run. In fact, overexercising, or exercising more than your body is used to, can completely change your normal period schedule. Gymnasts and the like often don't get their periods at all because they work out so much. While you shouldn't work out so much your body gets stunted, exercising regularly does have many benefits."

      "title": "Try acupuncture.",
      "content": "Try acupuncture. Acupuncture is among the oldest healing practices in the world, and is used to treat a wide array of physical ailments using pressure points rather than medicine. Getting acupuncture regularly can help regulate the menstrual cycle and alleviate mood swings, menstrual cramps, and other PMS symptoms. [3] X Research source It’s great for stress, too. However, some believe that it can stop your cycle entirely, so be sure to talk to your doctor before you begin taking this route."

      "title": "Have an orgasm.",
      "content": "Have an orgasm. New science says that orgasms can limit the duration of your period. How? Orgasms cause muscle spasms that in turn cause the blood from your uterus to flow out faster. If you are open to it, it's worth a shot. Most people have a higher sex drive during their periods, anyway. Wait till the third day or so (or whenever your period is a bit lighter), lay down some towels, and stick to the missionary position if you are having sex. You may be surprised how much you like it. Though it's less likely, you can get pregnant during your period. Play it safe and use protection."

      "title": "Drink plenty of water.",
      "content": "Drink plenty of water. Being dehydrated during your period can contribute to bloating and other unpleasant PMS symptoms. Try to drink more water than usual during your period to combat these symptoms. Cut down on caffeine, alcohol, and sodium while on your period, as these things dehydrate the body. If you do consume these goods, make up for it by drinking even more water."

      "title": "Drink more tea.",
      "content": "Drink more tea. Trying to fight that caffeine craving and staying away from soda and coffee? Turn to tea. Not only will it keep you going, but research says it's good for cramps, too. [4] X Research source Tea is the next best thing to water. If you can't drink water, this should be your go-to. In addition to keeping you hydrated, drinking tea has also been linked to fighting cancer, heart disease, and diabetes; encouraging weight loss; lowering cholesterol; and bringing about mental alertness.

      "title": "Get more vitamin C.",
      "content": "Get more vitamin C. Getting a lot of vitamin C can starve the uterus of progesterone, which in turn breaks down the uterine walls. All of these can lead to a more accelerated period, making it a thing of the past sooner.

      "content": "Avoid dairy, caffeine, sugar, alcohol, and red meat. These foods are known to cause cramps and upset stomach, in addition to leading to stress and anxiety (at least in caffeine's case). [9] X Research source To be on the safe side, just avoid them during your period. If you desperately need a pick-me-up, go for a bite of dark chocolate and glass of red wine. Dark chocolate has that sugar you're craving but is more natural; red wine has heart benefits and antioxidants that fight in your favor."

Some people take birth control solely for the purpose of shortening the duration and frequency of their periods. [10] X Research source Talk to your doctor to determine whether birth control is safe for you. The amount of periods you get each year will depend on the type of birth control you take.

      "content": "Consider other forms of birth control, too. Just about every form of birth control (hormonal IUD, the implant, the shot, the pill, the patch, and the ring) can make your period lighter. It won’t make it go away right now, but it can stop problems from arising later. Talk to your doctor about whether or not any of these options are right for you. If for some reason you don’t wish to have your period at all, many people report their period lapsing after taking the shot for about a year. [11] X Research source"
