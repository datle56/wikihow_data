    {
      "title": "Choose a mature, healthy plant to take your cuttings from in the spring.",
      "content": "Choose a mature, healthy plant to take your cuttings from in the spring. Start propagating philodendron in early spring (March in the Northern Hemisphere) when the days are beginning to get longer. Identify old growth in a mature plant — the tougher, woodier stems towards the base of the plant rather than the springy new growth at the top and ends of the plant. You'll be taking your cuttings from this old growth. [3] X Research source If you try to propagate your philodendron in the fall or winter, it may be spring before the plant starts rooting. In the meantime, your cutting will likely rot."

    {
      "title": "Find the nodes where the leaf attaches to the main stem.",
      "content": "Find the nodes where the leaf attaches to the main stem. A healthy plant will have many nodes. Your cutting will grow roots from the node. Typically, a philodendron cutting is either an internodal cutting or a leaf-bud cutting. [4] X Research source Internodal cuttings work for hanging or vining plants. Look for a cluster of nodes so you can cut between them. For a leaf-bud cutting, look for a single node off by itself on the main stem. That will make it easier to take your cutting without causing too much damage to the original plant."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the stem between 2 nodes for most philodendron varieties.",
      "content": "Cut the stem between 2 nodes for most philodendron varieties. Internodal cuttings work best for upright philodendron varieties, including the Green Congo, Rojo Congo, Super Atom, and Moonlight varieties. To make an internodal cutting, use a sharp, clean knife (or pruners) to slice between 2 nodes, taking one of them off for your cutting and leaving the other intact. Cut horizontally or vertically, depending on how the node is sitting on the stem. You don't want to cut into the node. [6] X Research source Snip just below the node, taking care to leave as little stem as possible under the node. The roots grow from the node, so if there's a lot of stem left under the node, it will just rot off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a leaf-bud cutting for crawling varieties of philodendron.",
      "content": "Use a leaf-bud cutting for crawling varieties of philodendron. With a leaf-bud cutting, the leaf and bud are the focus of your cutting rather than the nodes. This type of cutting works best for varieties such as fiddle-leaf, heart-leaf, and Brandi philodendron. To make a leaf-bud cutting, take your knife and cut in a semi-circle around the node on one side of the stem. [7] X Research source If you cut properly, the stem will come to a point at the top and bottom on either side of the node. Cut around the node, taking care not to cut too deeply into the stem of the original plant. If you take too much from the original plant it will be difficult for it to heal, so leave as much as possible of the original stem intact."

      "title": "Take multiple cuttings that are 4 and 6 inches (10 and 15 cm) long if possible.",
      "content": "Take multiple cuttings that are 4 and 6 inches (10 and 15 cm) long if possible. If you only have one mature philodendron plant, you may not be able to take more than one cutting without taking too much from the original plant. However, if possible, multiple cuttings give you a better chance that at least one of them will root. [9] X Research source Avoid cutting your original plant back to a single stem. Leave enough of the plant intact that it can heal and continue to grow. Take care not to take any new, bright green growth. It will be less likely to root."

      "content": "Snip off any lower leaves and stems on the cutting. Cut leaves closely and carefully, taking care not to damage the main stem. Leave at least 3 or 4 leaves at the top of the cutting.

      "content": "Mix Perlite into potting soil to make the propagation medium. Perlite, vermiculite, orchid bark, and even sand will ensure that your propagation medium is light and loose enough to provide enough support while also allowing for drainage. You can also buy commercial propagation mediums at your local gardening center that have similar properties. However, evaluate the components of the medium carefully. Many commercial potting mediums are too heavy to propagate philodendron. [11] X Research source If you want to give your philodendron a boost, you might try adding rooting hormone, which you can find at your local gardening center. However, philodendron typically root just fine without it. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a nursery tray or similar-sized container with propagation medium. Propagate each cutting in a separate container. Add the propagation medium loosely, ensuring that air and water can easily pass through it. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the top of your medium and the rim of the container so you can move the medium around when you introduce your cutting. [13] X Research source Use a container with drainage holes. You can place a piece of mesh, a paper towel, or a coffee filter over the drainage holes to prevent soil from escaping. The container will still drain excess water properly."

      "content": "Moisten the propagation medium thoroughly with tap water. Add the water gradually to layers of your propagation medium, working it through the medium with your hands. Make sure the entire propagation medium is thoroughly moistened. [14] X Research source The medium should be damp to the touch but not so wet that you can squeeze water out of it. Make sure it's consistently moist without any dry spots."

      "title": "Insert the cutting deeply into the medium.",
      "content": "Insert the cutting deeply into the medium. Center the cutting in your tray and insert it into your propagation medium until the node is completely covered. Move your medium around the cutting to help stabilize it so it won't fall over in the tray. If you've made a leaf-bud cutting, ensure that only the leaf is visible above the surface of the propagation medium. [15] X Research source Add more medium as necessary to stabilize the stem if you have a longer cutting. Your cutting should be able to stand up straight in the tray."

      "content": "Cover the propagation trays with plastic to maintain humidity. Before your cuttings root, they have no way of replacing the moisture they lose. Keeping plastic over the propagation trays helps hold in the moisture. [16] X Research source Poke holes in the plastic so air can continue to flow through it. If you used individual containers instead of nursery trays, you can cover them with plastic sheeting or even an old plastic grocery bag. Make sure air can flow through the plastic."

      "content": "Set your cuttings in indirect sunlight with a day temperature of at least 70 °F (21 °C). Philodendron make good houseplants because they tolerate temperatures similar to the normal household environment. However, when you're propagating cuttings, make sure the temperature is slightly warmer. A temperature of around 75 °F (24 °C) is ideal. [17] X Research source Direct sunlight can burn the leaves and impede rooting. Make sure your cuttings are protected from direct sunlight while they're rooting."

      "content": "Tug on your cuttings after 4 weeks to check for rooting. In the spring and summer, philodendron typically root in about 4 weeks. Grasp the plant close to the soil line and give it a short, gentle tug. If you feel resistance, that means your cuttings have started to grow roots. [18] X Research source Generally, you want roots that are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) long and have started to form into a ball. If you start propagating in spring, your new philodendron should be ready to transplant in 4 to 6 weeks. New plant growth above soil level is a clear indication that your cuttings have rooted."

If you already have a mature philodendron, you'll have a good idea of how big the planter should be.

Moisten the potting medium slowly, turning it over in your hands or with a trowel to ensure it's all evenly damp. It should be moist enough to stick together, but not so moist that you can squeeze water out of it. [21] X Research source Any quality potting soil works for philodendron as long as it drains well. You can also mix in Perlite or peat moss. [22] X Research source"

However, the root ball of your philodendron should be about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) below the rim of the planter. This ensures that the plant will grow at the correct level over the planter.
