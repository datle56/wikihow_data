      "title": "Position the ball with the valve facing you.",
      "content": "Position the ball with the valve facing you. This is optional although it can give the ball a better flight movement in the air. When Ronaldo takes a free kick, he always lines up the ball so the valve will make contact with his foot. It's difficult to know if this contact has any real effect on the trajectory of the ball or if it's just superstition, but it can't hurt to try. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Take five steps back to the left at an angle if you're right footed or to the right if you're left footed, then take one and a half steps to the opposite side.",
      "content": "Take five steps back to the left at an angle if you're right footed or to the right if you're left footed, then take one and a half steps to the opposite side. Stand with your arms straight down and spread your legs very wide, more than shoulder-width. Take a deep breath."

      "title": "Plant your non-kicking foot on the ground and lean forward.",
      "content": "Plant your non-kicking foot on the ground and lean forward. His free-kicks tend to go up high very quickly, seeming to explode off his foot. This comes from the quick and short follow through right after making contact with the ball. If done properly, the kick won't spin, but will arc up, then dip back down quickly, or zig-zag according to the power put in with the follow-through. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Contact the ball just below the centre of the ball with your instep.",
      "content": "Contact the ball just below the centre of the ball with your instep. You want to make contact on the ball in the area between your laces and your instep. [3] X Expert Source Walter Merino Soccer Coach Expert Interview. 29 January 2020. Aim for the nozzle valve that you faced toward you at the beginning of the kick. To give it the knuckle-ball effect, you need to avoid putting any spin on the ball whatsoever. Try to hit the ball just below the middle but not too low so that it doesn't take backspin. Not rolling it off your foot at all."

    {
      "title": "Follow through.",
      "content": "Follow through. The most important part of the kick is the follow-through. Follow through by pointing your kicking foot where you want the ball to go, swiveling around toward your target and driving your plant foot off the ground and up into the air. [4] X Expert Source Walter Merino Soccer Coach Expert Interview. 29 January 2020. Bring your kicking knee straight up instead of the more traditional follow-through in which you end up to the side. Imagine you wanted to make the knee of your kicking foot touch your chin after you make contact with the ball. Done properly, your kicking foot should hit the ground first. Now stand back and watch your knuckle-ball in all its unpredictable glory."

      "title": "Take the ball into the box.",
      "content": "Take the ball into the box. Unlike Beckham, known for his long, elegant, arcing crosses with a ton of spin on them, Ronaldo's crosses are more like little behind-the-back passes in basketball. He takes the ball deep into enemy territory, then pops it into the air back across the field of play toward a team made for a header or a shot. Though he often plays on the left side of the field, Ronaldo also switches, depending on the play as it progresses, and will go to the center to take crosses as well. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Pop the ball up to a teammate.",
      "content": "Pop the ball up to a teammate. To pop a Ronaldo-style cross, make contact with your foot straight, and your plant foot well-behind the ball. Make your follow-through very short to pop the ball up as much as possible, giving your teammate an opportunity to get a head on it."

    {
      "title": "Develop your cross from both feet.",
      "content": "Develop your cross from both feet. One of the freakiest things about Ronaldo is that he seems to be just as good from both feet. His left-footed crosses and shots are just as wobbly and accurate as his right-footed crosses. Work on your non-dominant footwork by doing dribbling drills with both feet, and taking as many wrong-footed shots on goal as possible. Practice your fundamentals until you can get the right kind of power from both feet, even if it feels backwards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Control your dribble with step-overs.",
      "content": "Control your dribble with step-overs. Ronaldo's footwork makes him able to get the crosses off in time, making his play unpredictable and thrilling to watch. If you want to be able to take the ball that deep into territory, you're going to have to be able to evade defensive players and juke them out of their shorts. Practice step-overs to imitate Ronaldo's great dribble. Also, try to practice his distinctive behind-the-leg direction switching pass that he does to himself."
