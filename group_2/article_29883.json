      "content": "Dissolve 1 cup sugar in 4 cups water. Pour the sugar and water into a bowl and stir the mixture until the sugar is no longer visible. This way your slushie won't taste grainy after it freezes. In place of the sugar and water combination, you can use 4 cups of your favorite drink. Try making a slushie out of any type of soda, fruit juice, chocolate milk, and even coffee! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix in flavored extract and food coloring. You need 1 1/2 teaspoons extract and 5 to 10 drops of food coloring. Taste the mixture and add more or less according to your preference. If you want a creamy slushie, stir in a tablespoon or two of cream. This pairs especially well with orange or vanilla extract. To make it a little fancier, try adding a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of lemon zest."

      "content": "Add flavor and color. To imitate the classic slushie, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of your favorite flavored extract (like raspberry, strawberry, lemon, lime, coconut or vanilla) and 5 or more drops of food coloring. Use a long-handled spoon to stir it all together. You can add a little more flavored extract or coloring to taste. [2] X Research source Do you love soda-flavored slushies? Make one by freezing you favorite soda to make ice cubes. Replace the water and ice with cold soda and soda ice cubes, and leave out the sugar. Don't have time to buy flavored extract? You can use a packet of Kool-Aid powder in place of flavor and food coloring."

      "content": "Blend the sugar water with 2 cups of ice. Just pour the sugar water into your blender and add 2 cups of whole ice cubes. This method works best if your blender is powerful enough to grind ice finely, creating the classic slushie texture. You might want to test-grind some ice cubes to make sure your blender can handle it; if not, just try another method. If you like your slushies thinner, add another 1/2 cup of water. If you like a thicker, icier texture, reduce the water by 1/2 cup."

Keep going until the ice has been crushed and the mixture takes on the right consistency. It can help to periodically stir the mixture with a long-handled spoon to help the ice circulate. If your blender isn't quite powerful enough, transfer the mixture to a food processor and process it in batches."
