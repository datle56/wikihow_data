In these cases, you'll have to call the service carrier listed on the SIM card to ask. If you can't make outbound phone calls, take the card to a store that sells that service carrier's SIM cards. A customer service representative should be able to help you track down the associated phone number. If you bought a new SIM card, it may not have a number yet at all. Once you place it into a compatible phone, you'll be able to activate it on the carrier's network. If you are calling from the phone using the mystery SIM card, the carrier may be able to detect the number automatically. If not, have the SIM card visible so you can read aloud the serial number."
