      "title": "Choose the right tray.",
      "content": "Choose the right tray. Ice cube trays are available in several different materials, including plastic, silicone, and stainless steel. Choose the material that best fits your needs. You can also find trays that make ice in a variety of shapes. A cube shape is obviously the classic option, but you may prefer a tray that makes heart, star, fish, or other novelty-shaped cubes for a party or special occasion. [1] X Research source Plastic ice cube trays are the least expensive and durable. They may absorb freezer odors and crack when you remove the ice. Silicone ice cube trays are more expensive, but they're durable and don't crack. They tend to absorb freezer odors the most. Stainless steel trays are the most expensive and durable, but they also don't absorb any odors. Wooden ice cube trays can be very inexpensive if you make them yourself. They make the highest-quality ice cubes."

      "content": "Wash the tray thoroughly. Even if your ice cube tray is brand new, it's a good idea to wash it before you fill it. If it is a new tray, rinse it in a hot water and dry thoroughly with a clean towel. If it's an old tray, you should use hot water and dish detergent to wash it in order to remove any ice or food residue from the freezer. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Deodorize old ice trays to reduce off-flavors, if needed.",
      "content": "Deodorize old ice trays to reduce off-flavors, if needed. Mix 2 teaspoons (10 g) of baking soda with ½ cup (120 ml) of warm water. Pour the solution into the tray, then scrub all of the wells with a clean cloth. Rinse the tray with warm water, then allow it to dry. If your tray produces off-tasting ice cubes, that means it has absorbed odors from the freezer. Washing it with this baking soda solution will help fix that."

      "title": "Fill the tray with water.",
      "content": "Fill the tray with water. Once the tray is washed and dried, fill it with water. Try to pour the same amount of water into each compartment so the cubes will all freeze in the same amount of time. [3] X Research source You can use tap water, but be aware that the minerals in the water can give you cloudy, poor-tasting ice cubes. Filtered or bottled water typically produces better-tasting ice cubes than tap water, but be aware that the ice may still look cloudy. If you want crystal clear ice, boil the water first. Let it cool, boil it a second time, then use it to fill the tray."

      "title": "Place the tray on a flat surface in the freezer.",
      "content": "Place the tray on a flat surface in the freezer. When the ice cube tray is filled, it's time to put it in the freezer. Many freezers have an area that's meant to hold ice cube trays, but if yours doesn't, find a spot where the tray can sit on a flat surface to allow the cubes to freeze evenly. [4] X Research source The back of the freezer tends to be the coldest, so try to place the tray as far back as you can."

      "title": "Allow the ice to freeze for several hours.",
      "content": "Allow the ice to freeze for several hours. In order for the water to freeze into solid cubes, you'll need to leave the tray in the freezer for approximately six hours. For best results, however, leave the tray in the freezer overnight. [5] X Research source How long it takes for the cubes to freeze depends on how deep you filled the tray and how crowded your freezer is."

    {
      "title": "Remove the cubes from the tray for storage.",
      "content": "Remove the cubes from the tray for storage. When the ice cubes have frozen solid in the tray, you should remove them. Storing them in the tray exposes them to the scents and tastes in your freezer, which can lead to poor tasting ice. Pop the cubes out of the tray, and store them in an airtight freezer bag or plastic container. [6] X Research source Some ice cube trays come with a cover. If yours had a lid, you can store the cubes in the tray. This way, the tray will catch any potential drips or spills. You shouldn't leave ice cubes in the freezer for more than a week even if they're in an airtight container. Make a fresh batch if your ice is old."

      "title": "Fill the tray with fruit juice.",
      "content": "Fill the tray with fruit juice. If you don't want the ice cubes to water down your lemonade, iced tea, soda, or other sweet drinks, you may want to replace the water in your ice cube tray. Fill the tray with your favorite fruit juice to make flavorful ice that won't dilute your drinks. [7] X Research source Use the ice cubes in the same drink that you made them from. For example, use lemonade ice cubes in lemonade. Mix and match flavors. For example, add lemonade ice cubes to fruit punch for a zesty twist."

      "title": "Freeze coffee in the tray.",
      "content": "Freeze coffee in the tray. If you enjoy iced coffee drinks, you probably aren't a fan of how the ice can water down the drink. Instead of using traditional ice cubes, fill your tray with coffee to ensure that the last sip of your coffee is as delicious as the first. [8] X Research source To avoid wasting coffee, use the leftover amount in your morning pot to make the ice cubes. Don't add milk to the ice cubes, however. The ice cubes will spoil faster, and the milk fat may also separate, creating a grainy texture as it melts."

      "title": "Add herbs or fruit to the water in the tray.",
      "content": "Add herbs or fruit to the water in the tray. If you want decorative ice cubes for a party or other special event, try suspending fruit, herbs, or edible flowers in your cubes. Add water to the tray to fill the compartments halfway, and freeze them for 20 to 30 minutes. Add the fruit, herbs leaves, or flowers of your choice, and fill the compartments the rest of the way with water before freezing fully. [9] X Research source Fruits that work well for decorative cubes include raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries, watermelon. Herbs such as basil and mint are ideal for “fillings” for ice cubes."
