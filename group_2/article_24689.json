      "content": "A karmic cycle is a series of repetitive events or emotions. This pattern is believed to be an opportunity for growth and healing, offering valuable life lessons. Those who study Buddhism or dabble in spiritual practices (yoga, astrology, etc.) work to break karmic cycles to evolve mentally and spiritually. [1] X Research source In Eastern cultures, karmic cycles intertwine with the belief of reincarnation. If every person has lived multiple lives, there’s bound to be repeated feelings and occurrences.

      "content": "You get a sense of déjà vu. If things feel oddly familiar in your life, yet you don’t remember being in a similar situation, it may be a karmic cycle. On the other hand, perhaps you can see similar connections in your life. Maybe your partner reminds you of your rageful mother, or you drink past your limit each night as your father used to. The toxic and repetitive patterns you see within yourself or that odd feeling of “I’ve done this before” may signify a karmic cycle."

      "content": "You attract the same types of people. When you consistently surround yourself with toxic people, it could mean you’re spiritually in a karmic cycle. Perhaps you find yourself gravitating toward relationships that feel comfortable, even if they present red flags and toxic traits you know all too well. Psychologically, this is called repetition compulsion —the unconscious decision to repeat traumatic experiences to control the past.

      "content": "You’re met by your greatest fears. Say you fear public speaking, and you’re asked to speak up at work, school, or clubs over and over again. Finding yourself in uncomfortable positions repeatedly could be a sign of karmic opportunity. The universe is shuffling you through a karmic cycle and putting you in front of your fears to help you overcome them ."

      "title": "Forgive yourself.",
      "content": "Forgive yourself. The first step to breaking a karmic cycle is to forgive yourself for past mistakes and traumas. In order to move forward, you need to be kind to yourself. Rather than blaming yourself, reflect on why something may have happened, and then acknowledge what you learned from the experience (no matter how awful). Swap negative thoughts with positive ones. For instance, instead of thinking, “I can’t believe I did that. I’m so stupid,” try, “I made a decision that I thought was right in the moment, and that’s alright. I’ve learned from it.” Reflect on how past traumas have made you stronger, not weaker. Say you were in a bad relationship. Things may have been rough, but now you know what to avoid in a partner moving forward. It’s perfectly okay to mourn the life you once had or regret making a decision, but do your best to avoid stewing in hatred. Everyone makes mistakes. It’s what you learn from them that really counts."

      "content": "Let go of resentment and fear. Along with forgiving yourself, it’s important to release built-up anger. Learn to forgive those who have harmed you and let go of grudges. Not only does this help break a karmic cycle, but it can also improve your mental health and invite healthier relationships into your life. Write in a journal to process your emotions and reflect on your fears, worries, and resentment.

For example, try saying, “What you did isn’t okay.” [6] X Research source Forgiveness can mean something different for every person, so do what’s best for you, whether that’s forgiving someone in person or mentally doing so on your own."

Mindfulness can be as simple as living in the present moment! Try some of these mindfulness exercises to evoke more positivity into your life and break the karmic cycle: [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Pay attention to the world around you. Stop what you’re doing and look around the room. What can you see, smell, touch, and hear? Focus on your breathing. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in and out. How did it make you feel? Notice how your chest expands and contracts. Try a walking meditation. Slowly walk 10 to 20 feet in a quiet space. What does the ground feel like? What can you see and hear? Focus on each sensation."

      "content": "Make different choices. One of the best and easiest ways to break out of a karmic cycle is to turn the tables and do something different . Karma is a balance of cause and effect, so make a new decision that causes something new to happen. For example, if you’re getting taken advantage of at work, start looking for a new job or stand up for yourself rather than staying silent. If you’re always dating people from other states, focus on dating within your community."

      "title": "Karmic cycles can pull you into toxic relationships.",
      "content": "Karmic cycles can pull you into toxic relationships. Karmic relationships reflect lessons the universe wants you to learn. These temporary relationships often start suddenly and can be driven by selfishness, jealousy, or emotional rage. While the relationship may feel stable at first, it can quickly become emotionally abusive, mirroring traumas from your past. When you’re in a karmic cycle, falling into a karmic relationship is easier because your energy is attracting challenges. You’re likely in a karmic relationship if you had an instant connection with your partner, you don’t feel safe around them, and they remind you of a past toxic relationship."

      "title": "Karmic cycles can benefit spiritual healing by challenging you.",
      "content": "Karmic cycles can benefit spiritual healing by challenging you. There’s no denying that being caught in a karmic cycle is hard—the universe is testing you, after all. By facing your fears and re-experiencing past traumas, you’re forced to grow wiser. A karmic cycle helps you spiritually from the inside out. Healing isn’t an easy journey, and that’s okay. Take a deep breath, and don’t be afraid to ask yourself hard questions. We know it’s hard, but each challenge presents a new opportunity to become a better and stronger version of yourself. Having trouble navigating a karmic cycle on your own? Don’t hesitate to reach out for help! Talk to a therapist or spiritual healer for guidance on navigating traumas."
