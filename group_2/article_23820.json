It should happen naturally at a time when two people are sharing an intimate and private moment together, and that means being physically close. [1] X Research source To help set the mood, start by finding a way to be alone with the person so you can get close without other people hanging around and interrupting. If you two are at a party, go for a walk or find somewhere quiet that you can talk. If you're hanging out together, sit down beside the person on a couch, chair, or bench."

Eye contact is another powerful element of body language, and when two people are physically close to each other and make frequent eye contact, this will raise the level of intimacy between them. [5] X Research source Frequent eye contact will indicate your attraction, and help you assess whether the chemistry you feel is reciprocated. For instance, if your partner keeps looking away instead of making eye contact, it’s possible that person is just nervous, but it might also be a sign of lack of interest. On the other hand, if your partner keeps locking eyes with you, this is a good sign that whatever you're feeling is definitely mutual!"
