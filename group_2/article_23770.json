      "content": "Standing can tone your muscles and increase your metabolism by improving blood flow. Try to switch between sitting and standing every 30 minutes. Believe it or not, low-intensity activities, like standing, play an important role in maintaining your metabolism and resting energy expenditure. [1] X Research source You might switch to a standing desk at work, or take plenty of standing breaks throughout the day."

[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source From a scientific standpoint, muscle burns over twice as many calories as fat; therefore, the more muscle you have, the more calories you’ll burn in the long term. Add some compound exercises to your strength-training routine—these are exercises that work multiple muscle groups and together build muscle faster. [3] X Research source Deadlifts, lunges, bench presses, squats, and shoulder presses are all great strength-training exercises to try."

[4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To get started, do a high-intensity activity, like sprinting, biking, or swimming, for at least 20 seconds. Do the exercise at full intensity, and then take a short break. Cycle through exercising and resting in short bursts to make your body work harder and really get the most out of a HIIT workout. [5] X Research source For instance, you might do 20 seconds of a reverse lunge and 10 seconds of push-ups. Then, you’d rest for 1 minute before doing another set. [6] X Research source According to experts, traditional exercise like swimming or biking is generally not intense enough to increase your metabolism for very long once you’ve finished your workout, although swimming in cold water has been shown to slightly increase thyroid activity.

      "content": "The number of meals you have isn't directly related to your metabolism. Instead, focus on taking in enough calories to avoid becoming uncomfortably hungry, and follow a meal plan that meets your needs. If you’re worried about overeating or getting too hungry between meals, eating 6 small meals per day might be a good option for you and may also help balance out glucose and insulin levels. If you prefer eating in bigger portions, a 3-meal schedule might be the best choice for preventing overeating. [8] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source According to experts, athletes tend to do better with a small-portion meal plan spread throughout the day to maintain more stable glucose and energy levels."

      "content": "As you digest food, you actually burn calories in the process. Also known as the thermic effect of food (TEF), this calorie-burning process boosts your metabolism as your body breaks down food. Luckily, protein-rich foods amp up your metabolism even more than carb-rich or fatty foods, and replacing sugary soft drinks or fruit juice with protein-rich drinks such as milk or soymilk has been shown to increase TEF thanks to their content of calcium and protein. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Beef, lamb, poultry, fish, and seafood are all great sources of protein. [10] X Research source Beef and other meats are sources of carnitine and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), both of which help the body metabolize lipids for energy and enhance beta oxidation. Beans, nuts, eggs, and dairy are other excellent protein options. Many beans provide both high-quality protein and resistant starch, which stimulate TEF and beta oxidation more efficiently together, and kidney beans are an excellent source of iron, which is needed to help fuel your metabolism by supporting oxidative phosphorylation."

      "content": "Cold water can give your metabolism a quick boost by forcing the body to produce more body heat. Drinking large volumes of cold water quickly may offer an additional bonus by increasing serum norepinephrine levels and stimulating sympathetic activity. According to some studies, drinking 10 mL (0.35 imp fl oz; 0.34 fl oz) of water can boost your metabolism for about 40 minutes. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Overall, experts recommend that women drink at least 11½ cups (2.7 L) of water each day, and men drink 15½ cups (3.7 L).

      "content": "Exposing yourself to cold temperatures forces your body to ramp up its production of thermogenic hormones such as norepinephrine and thyroxine. Things like lowering the thermostat, wearing lighter clothes, taking cold showers, or hiking at high altitude can help your body build up a tolerance to the cold, use oxygen more effectively, and make your metabolism more efficient at burning fat over time."

Then, breathe in and out through your right nostril at least 25 times. Repeat this exercise about 4 times each day—according to some studies, this can both soothe your nervous system and increase parasympathetic activity and resting metabolism.
