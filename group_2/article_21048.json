For instance, if you type something into cell A2, a timestamp will appear in cell M2. There are many different example scripts online that you can use for this purpose. Whichever one you choose, make sure to remove any smart quotes in the code and replace them with straight quotes, or the script won’t work properly."

The M in line 4 of the script indicates the column where the timestamp will appear. If you want it to appear in a different column, change it to whichever letter or column name you like (e.g., change M to B if you want the timestamp in column B). You can also change the number format in line 7 to display just the time, if you like. Simply delete the MM/dd/yyy"
