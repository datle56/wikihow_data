      "content": "Lay out under natural sunlight to develop a tan. To develop an even, all-over suntan, first apply sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 15 (SPF 30 or more is a safer choice). Lay out on your back under direct sunlight with your skin exposed. After about 20 or 30 minutes, flip over to your belly. Another 20 or 30 minutes later, cover up your skin and get out of the sun. Most sunscreens take a while to soak into your skin and start working, so wait 20 minutes after applying sunscreen before going outside. [1] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020. Repeat this process a couple of times per week and you’ll start to notice your skin tone gradually deepening. Skin cells produce melanin as a way of protecting their DNA from UV damage. As you’ve probably noticed in sunnier seasons, exposing your skin to more UV radiation spurs on the production of melanin and your skin gets darker.

When your skin takes in more UV radiation than it can handle, you’re left with thermal burns and blood flow increases to that area, leaving your skin red and irritated. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Sunburns damage your skin cells and halt melanin production. Don’t overdo your sun exposure. Instead, limit yourself to 1 hour per day. Give your skin time to rest away from the sun’s UV rays between tanning sessions. Don’t attempt to get a serious sunburn to “start” your tan. This habit is a myth and will slow your progress toward a gradual tan. Sunburned skin can develop skin cancer and early signs of aging. [4] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020. Remember that since melanin production is a sign of skin cell damage, there’s not a “safe” way to get a suntan."

Apply sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or more to all exposed areas of skin. This includes easy-to-forget areas like your feet, ears, and scalp. Lather on more sunscreen than you think you should – 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of sunscreen should effectively cover your body. Reapply sunscreen once every 2 hours, and immediately after your skin gets wet. [6] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020.

If you’re not in the habit of hydrating yet, carry around a water bottle and gradually increase your consumption from 1 bottle to 5 or more. Drinking plenty of water will prevent you from becoming hydrated. Dehydration plus overexposure to the sun can lead you to feel very ill. You won’t be worrying about your tan if you get rushed into the emergency room for an IV drip. [7] X Research source"

While you’re in the bed, wear protective goggles and a bathing suit. Rotate your body to achieve an even tan. Start out with short sessions of 5 to 7 minutes. In consultation with a salon technician, gradually increase your sessions once you have a deeper skin tone. [8] X Research source The use of tanning beds is strongly discouraged by dermatologists and doctors since they can cause skin cancer.

Repeat this process on a weekly basis until you reach your desired skin tone. Note that Melanotan-II is not FDA approved. It is typically sold online. However, sale and consumption are banned in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. Dermatologists warn against taking these injections due to the unknown long-term effects. Melanotan II was designed as an erectile dysfunction treatment. Be aware of the hormone’s ED-related effects."
