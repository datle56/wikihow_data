Or, go up and down the stairs in your home a few times while you’re waiting for water to boil in the kitchen.

      "content": "Experts recommend at least 150 minutes of cardio per week. Start with this as your goal, but don’t force it if you’re just beginning your workout journey . If it’s too hard at first to do this much cardio activity, ease into it by doing 30 minutes of aerobic activity 3 days a week instead. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Adding any amount of exercise to your routine is certainly beneficial for your health, especially if you weren’t exercising very often before. Any amount of exercise is better than none at all! However, to noticeably improve your cardio fitness and endurance you’ll likely need to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you do 30 minutes of cardio activity only once a week, you might not see as noticeable results as you would see if you did a 30-minute workout on each weekday."

      "content": "It’s easier to stick to an exercise routine if you enjoy your workouts. Select activities that match your lifestyle, personal preferences, and current fitness level . If you have any previous injuries, choose activities that you can do without hurting yourself. Examples of cardio activities are brisk walking , jogging, running , swimming, cycling, aerobics, playing tennis , hiking , stair climbing, rowing, and jumping rope. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you haven’t worked out in years, it’s probably easier to start your new cardio fitness routine with something like brisk walking than it is by attempting to hike up a steep mountain right away."

      "content": "Changing up your routine helps prevent excessive joint and muscle stress. Incorporate at least 2-3 different cardio activities that use different muscles and movements into your new fitness routine to avoid pain. Choose 1 activity that mainly uses your legs and 1 activity that uses more of your upper body, for example. [6] X Research source For instance, you could choose to run on some days and swim on others. If you have arthritis, aquatic activities like aquatic aerobics and swimming are good choices because they don’t stress your joints.

      "content": "Allowing your body and muscles to recover prevents injuries. Do a high-impact activity like running one day, then do a low-impact cardio exercise like swimming the next time you work out. That way, you’re giving your knees, feet, and hips a break from pounding on the pavement. [8] X Research source Other low-impact cardio activities are cycling, rowing, and rollerblading. Other high-impact cardio exercises are jogging , jumping jacks , and jump rope."

For example, run, bike, row, or swim as fast as you can for 30 seconds, then do the activity at an easy pace for 30 seconds. Repeat the exercise in 30-second intervals of easy and hard paces for the duration of your workout. [9] X Research source When 30-second intervals become too easy, step up the intervals to 60 seconds. You can also do distance intervals instead of time intervals. For instance, run as fast as you can for 1 lap around a track, then jog 1 lap slowly at an easy pace and repeat."

Gradually increase the intensity until you’re working out at your target intensity. [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, if you’re going on a run, start out at a slow jogging pace for 5 minutes, then gradually speed up for the next 5 minutes until you’re fully running."

      "content": "You have to challenge yourself to actually improve your cardio fitness. Work out hard enough that you feel your heart rate rise and the activity is difficult to do. [11] X Research source To make sure you’re working out in the ideal aerobic zone, take your pulse manually , wear a device that monitors your heart rate , or use a workout machine that tells you your heart rate, like an elliptical or treadmill. Set a target heart rate with your healthcare provider or a qualified trainer. Your target heart rate will be the number of heartbeats per minute you’re trying to reach while performing your cardio exercises. Over time, you’ll start to notice that you need to do more intense physical activity to reach your target heart rate. For example, at first you might reach your target heart rate by going on short walks, but after a while, you might need to take a longer jog to reach the same heart rate. This means that your cardiovascular fitness is improving!

[13] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source This is how you know you’re improving your cardio fitness. When your typical workouts start to feel much easier, challenge yourself with more intense exercises or longer workout sessions. Try to gradually increase the amount of time or distance you run for by about 10-20% a week, for instance. Or, make your exercise harder in some way, such as briskly walking up a hill instead of across flat ground.
