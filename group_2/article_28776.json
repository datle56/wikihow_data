[9] X Research source If you absolutely cannot make fresh breadcrumbs or don't have the time or energy to do so, you can use store-bought breadcrumbs. Keep in mind that the recipe may not turn out as well, however. If you plan on making chicken burgers again in the near future, make a larger batch of fresh breadcrumbs, and freeze the leftovers in a bag."
