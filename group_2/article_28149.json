      "content": "Spread out a pair of sweatpants on a flat surface. You will be cutting these sweatpants up, so make sure that they are a pair you don't mind permanently altering. Make sure that the front of the pants is facing you. SMooth out the fabric so there are no wrinkles when you go to cut later. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay a pair of shorts on top, matching up the waistbands. Find a pair of shorts that are the length you want your new shorts to be. Place them on top of the sweatpants so that the waistbands are aligned. Make sure that the front of the shorts is facing you too. Alternatively, put the sweatpants on and make a mark with a fabric chalk or a washable fabric marker or pen where you want them to end, then take them off. [2] X Research source If you plan to hem the shorts, add an extra ½ to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm). It’s always a good idea to leave a little extra fabric—you can always make the shorts shorter, but you can’t make them longer!"

      "title": "Trace the bottom edge of the shorts with fabric chalk or a fabric pen.",
      "content": "Trace the bottom edge of the shorts with fabric chalk or a fabric pen. Kim recommends using chalk for dark fabrics and a pen or marker for light fabrics. If you need to, use a ruler to make the line nice and straight. If you want to hem the cuffs later for a finished look, add ½ to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) to the cuffs. Use a ruler to draw a straight line across 1 of the legs. Angle the line up towards the inseam slightly (about 15 degrees) to make the line look even when you’re wearing the shorts.

      "title": "Set the shorts aside and cut along the lines that you drew.",
      "content": "Set the shorts aside and cut along the lines that you drew. Use a sharp pair of scissors for this, and make sure that you cut through both layers of fabric. [4] X Research source If you plan on leaving the edges raw, cut just above the line that you drew so that it doesn't show on the finished product. [5] X Research source Alternatively, cut off the leg that you marked. Fold the pants in half, then use the cut edge as a guide for cutting the second leg off. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Leave the cut edges raw if you prefer a rugged look.",
      "content": "Leave the cut edges raw if you prefer a rugged look. Just like T-shirt material, sweatpants material does not fray. You can leave the cut edges of your sweatshorts raw and never have to worry about the fabric unraveling (although the edges may roll up slightly). Tip: Place a drop of super glue or fabric glue on the cut edges of the seams. This will prevent the seams from splitting."

    {
      "title": "Fold the cut edges inward and sew them if you want a finished cuff.",
      "content": "Fold the cut edges inward and sew them if you want a finished cuff. Fold the cut edges into the legs by about ½ inch (1.3 cm). Sew the hem down as close as possible to the cut edge. Use a thread color that matches your fabric and a straight stitch. [7] X Research source To guide your sewing, Kim suggests marking a straight line with a ruler and chalk and following the line. She adds, “I usually double up on my thread to make it easier. Thicker thread is much sturdier, so it doesn't tear off the fabric.” (Chalk washes off, so don’t worry about it showing on your final product.) Backstitch by about ½ inch (1.3 cm) when you start and finish sewing. Snip the excess thread off. Not a sewer? Use fabric glue or iron-on hem tape instead. Follow the instructions on the label or packaging."

      "title": "Fold sweatpant fabric in half, with the wrong sides facing out.",
      "content": "Fold sweatpant fabric in half, with the wrong sides facing out. Sweatpant fabric looks similar to T-shirt fabric on the right side and fuzzy on the wrong side. You can find it in most fabric shops. Make sure that you are folding along the grain. The thin stripes that make up the knitting should run parallel to the fold. [8] X Research source If you can't find sweatpant fabric, use T-shirt or jersey fabric instead."

      "title": "Fold a pair of shorts in half and place them on top of fabric.",
      "content": "Fold a pair of shorts in half and place them on top of fabric. Find a pair of loose-fitting shorts and fold them in half lengthwise. Place them on top of the folded fabric. Leave extra space at the top of the fabric, since this is where you’ll be sewing in an elastic band. [9] X Research source Double the width of the elastic that you'll be using for your waistband. This is how far the shorts should be from the top edge of the fabric. Make sure you have enough fabric (when folded in half) to be able to trace and cut this shape twice."

    {
      "title": "Cut around the shorts, leaving a ½ inch (1.3 cm) border for seam allowance.",
      "content": "Cut around the shorts, leaving a ½ inch (1.3 cm) border for seam allowance. Make sure that you only cut around the side and bottom edges of the shorts. Don't cut along the top edge. Instead, extend the side edges all the way up to the top edge of the fabric. [10] X Research source The extra length at the top edge of the shorts is for the waistband. For easier cutting, trace the shorts first. Use fabric chalk for dark fabrics and a fabric pen or marker for light fabrics. If you don't want to hem the cuffs, do not add a ½ inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance to the bottom of the shorts. Since the fabric is folded, you’ll be cutting 2 identical pieces. These pieces will make up one leg of your shorts (you’ll repeat this later for the other leg)."

      "title": "Pin the fabric and sew up both of the straight edges along the sides.",
      "content": "Pin the fabric and sew up both of the straight edges along the sides. This means the long, straight outer edge (which will become the outside seam of the leg) and the shorter straight edge on the opposite side that will become the inseam. Again, Kim recommends using a straight stitch, a matching thread color, and a ½ inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Backstitch when you start and finish sewing. [11] X Research source Use sewing pins to hold the fabric together as you sew, if needed. Remember to take them out when you are done sewing. Don’t sew the curved part that was the crotch/sew of your shorts yet. You are just doing the inseam and the outside seam for now."

      "content": "Fold the cuff up by ½ inch (1.3 cm) and sew it down to hem the legs, if desired. Roll the bottom edge of the pant leg up and sew as close as possible to the raw edge (it’s OK that the raw edge is showing on the outside because you’ll eventually flip the pant leg right-side out). Use a straight stitch and a matching thread color, just like before. Backstitch when you begin and finish sewing, and snip the excess thread off. If you don’t want to hem the legs, skip this step."

Cut the second shape out and sew up the straight side edges (inseam and outside seam of the legs). Sew the cuff, if desired. [12] X Research source At this point, you can trim the side seams down to ¼ inch (0.6 cm), or you can leave them as they are."

      "title": "Pin and sew the curved seat and crotch.",
      "content": "Pin and sew the curved seat and crotch. Pull apart the fabric layers along the unsewn edge (on the same side as the inseam) so you’ve got 2 layers of fabric in each hand (1 layer from both pant legs). You’ll see this makes a “V” or “U” shape, and this will be the seam that connects the legs together (running down from the center of the waistband, through your legs, and up your bum). Start sewing at the waistband (the top edge of the fabric). Work your way along the curve, and up towards the other end at the waistband. [14] X Research source Like before, use a straight stitch, ½ inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance, and a matching thread color. Remember to backstitch when you start and finish sewing. Remember to remove your pins as you sew. If your sewing machine needle hits them, it could damage your machine!"
