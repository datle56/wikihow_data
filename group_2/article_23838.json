      "content": "Talk to your doctor before using any treatment. Before using any over-the-counter medicine to treat a yeast infection, see your doctor or OB/GYN to confirm the diagnosis. They will likely do a physical exam and ask you questions about your health history. They will rule out other causes of vaginal discomfort before diagnosing a yeast infection. They can also advise you on how long to use boric acid and warn you of any health effects. Alternate treatments may be more effective for you based on your personal health history. Your doctor can give you a prescription to take to your pharmacy to have capsules made. When you go to your doctor, be ready to discuss the history of your symptoms and how they have evolved, including how many yeast infections you’ve had in the past and what is similar and different this time."

      "title": "Insert the suppository",
      "content": "Insert the suppository properly. Wash your hands and the outside of your vagina using mild soap and water just before bedtime. Lie down on your back and gently bend your knees with your legs slightly apart. Use your finger or an applicator to insert the boric acid suppository as far up into your vagina as it will comfortably go. Wait several minutes for the suppository to dissolve before sitting or standing up, or just thoroughly wash your hands then go directly to sleep. If you’re using a reusable applicator, clean it as directed by the manufacturer. Otherwise, throw it away. If it’s hard for you to insert the suppository while lying down, try standing with one foot propped up on the edge of the bathtub or a chair. It’s normal to have some discharge when using suppositories. Wear a panty liner to bed to avoid staining your underwear."

      "content": "Gather the materials you’ll need. To make boric acid suppository capsules at home, you will need the following tools: Boric acid powder (not crystals), empty size 0 gelatin capsules, a clean sheet of paper, and a clean kitchen knife.
