      "content": "Select plants that require similar growing conditions. If you’re growing multiple plants in a bottle terrarium, it’s important to select species that have similar requirements for light, moisture, and soil type. Choose your plants before you start assembling your bottle garden so that you can plan for their needs. [1] X Research source For example, if you want to grow succulents, you might choose zebra haworthia, hens-and-chicks, and kalanchoe. [2] X Research source For a bottle garden with a moister environment, you could go for peace lilies, Fittonia, and Syngonium."

      "title": "Choose a large, clear glass bottle or jar for your plants.",
      "content": "Choose a large, clear glass bottle or jar for your plants. Look for a glass bottle or jar that’s large enough to accommodate the type and number of plants you want to grow. The glass should be clear and colorless to allow in light and let you see the plants easily. [3] X Research source You can reuse your own containers, such as jam jars or glass milk jugs, or purchase a glass bottle online or from a craft store. If you choose to reuse a bottle, wash it thoroughly before adding plants. For easier planting, choose a jar or bottle with an opening large enough to allow your hand in. Otherwise, you can use a long pair of tweezers or chopsticks to insert the plants."

      "content": "Get a bottle that can be closed for a more humid environment. If you’re growing plants that enjoy a moist environment, a closed bottle terrarium is a fun, low-maintenance option. Choose a bottle that you can close with a lid or stopper to prevent evaporation and eliminate the need for frequent watering. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Ideally, your bottle should have a clear cover, such as a glass lid or stopper. However, a small cork stopper will also work if the bottle allows in enough light otherwise."

      "title": "Opt for an open bottle if your plants need less water.",
      "content": "Opt for an open bottle if your plants need less water. For succulents and other plants that grow in arid environments, an open bottle, jar, or fishbowl-style container is a better option. This will allow water to evaporate more quickly so that your plants don’t get waterlogged. [5] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source A container with straight sides and a wide opening, such as a jar, will allow for faster evaporation. If you still want a relatively humid environment but don’t want a completely closed ecosystem, choose a bottle with slanted or curved sides and a narrow opening."

      "content": "Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) of horticultural grit to the bottom of the bottle. You’ll need to provide good drainage so that your plants don’t become waterlogged, which can lead to root rot and yellowing leaves. [6] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Pour a little horticultural grit or some small, clean pebbles into the bottom of your bottle so that excess water will pool there instead of around your plants’ roots. [7] X Research source You can buy horticultural grit or planting gravel online or from your local garden supply center."

      "title": "Purchase a potting soil that’s appropriate for your plants.",
      "content": "Purchase a potting soil that’s appropriate for your plants. The type of potting soil you choose will depend on the level of moisture and the types of nutrients your plants require. In general, though, it will need to be well-draining, high in organic content, and free of contaminants that might cause infections in your plants. [8] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Research the kind of potting soil that’s best for the plants you plan to grow and buy an appropriate mixture at your local garden center. For example, for succulents, use a 50/50 mixture of soil and sand, which won't hold onto any excess moisture. For more moisture-loving plants, such as peace lilies, opt for a general-purpose houseplant soil that holds a little moisture while still draining well."

      "content": "Plan how you would like the plants to be arranged in the bottle. Before you add plants to your bottle, consider what layout you think would be most attractive. Set the plants out on a flat surface and space them out similarly to the way they will be in the bottle. [12] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source For the best visibility, put low plants toward the front and taller ones at the back."

Trim away any damaged or unhealthy-looking foliage. Right before you add each plant to the bottle, carefully brush any excess potting soil or growing medium from their roots. [13] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source If the roots are extremely dense inside the original container, gently tease the root ball apart with your fingers.

      "content": "Insert each plant into the container one at a time. Use your fingers or a stick to make a depression in the soil where you want each plant. Carefully lower your plants into the bottle and cover their roots with soil. If you’re planting multiple plants, try to leave a little space between them so they have room to spread out. [14] X Research source If your bottle has a narrow opening, you may need to use tongs to insert the plants. Wrap the plants with paper before putting them in to protect the leaves as they pass through the opening. [15] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Try to position the plants so their foliage doesn’t touch the sides of the bottle, since moisture will tend to accumulate on the interior walls. Too much moisture can make the leaves rot."

Try to get the water to trickle along the wall of the bottle so it doesn’t pour directly onto the plants. Water the soil until it’s damp, but not soggy. [19] X Research source The curved sides of the bottle will help keep the inside of your container nice and moist between waterings. If you wish, you can put a lid on the bottle to maintain an even more humid environment. Alternatively, you can mist the plants instead of watering them. This will help wash off loose potting medium and prevent the soil from getting too sodden, especially if you already moistened it before planting.

      "content": "Place your bottle in a well-lit area out of direct sunlight. Most terrarium plants don’t need direct sun, but they will need some light to grow and stay healthy. Choose a spot in your home that stays bright but won’t allow in enough sun to scorch your plants. [21] X Research source East-facing windows often work well for this purpose. You can also use a grow light if your home doesn’t have any suitable windows."

      "content": "Prune your plants if they start to get too big. Plants grown in a bottle garden sometimes need pruning. If your plants are starting to become too tall for their space, trim them back a little to encourage them to grow out instead of up. [25] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Proactively trim or pinch off just the tips instead of pruning back most of the foliage after the plant has already gotten too tall. This will encourage healthier growth. Remember to disinfect your pruning tool with isopropyl alcohol to prevent the potential spread of disease to other plants."
