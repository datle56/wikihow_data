      "title": "Open your case.",
      "content": "Open your case. To install your new graphics card (also called a GPU), you'll need to open your computer's case. Most modern cases have thumbscrews on the back that allow you to easily remove the side panels, but you may need a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the screws on older cases. You should shut down your PC and disconnect the power cable and all peripherals before removing the side panels. Remove the panel on the opposite side of the motherboard. If you look at the back of your computer, you will see a panel on one side that contains a variety of ports, including USB, Ethernet, display ports, and more. This is the motherboard I/O panel and will help you see which side the motherboard is located on. You can lay your computer on this side and remove the opposite panel to access the motherboard easily."

      "title": "Ensure that your power supply is up to the task.",
      "content": "Ensure that your power supply is up to the task. Powerful graphics cards require a power supply that can give them the juice they need. If you're running an old power supply or have many other components drawing power, your power supply might not make the cut. If this is the case, consider upgrading your power supply at the same time that you upgrade your graphics card. There are a variety of sites online that help you calculate power requirements by analyzing all of the hardware currently installed or that you're planning to install. Search for \"power supply calculator\" using your favorite search engine. Your power supply will also need PCI-E connectors. This usually isn't an issue if your power supply is newer, but power supplies older than ten years may not have the appropriate connectors. Your power supply's maximum wattage should be printed on a sticker affixed to the power supply. You may need to remove the power supply to find it."

      "title": "Ensure that your motherboard supports the card.",
      "content": "Ensure that your motherboard supports the card. Virtually all graphics cards are PCI-E these days, so you will need to ensure that you have at least one of these slots. They are typically located closest to the processor in the row of PCI slots. If you don't have any PCI-E slots, you may need to install a new motherboard if you want to upgrade your graphics card. [2] X Expert Source Yaffet Meshesha Computer Specialist Expert Interview. 10 February 2021 Refer to your motherboard's documentation to find the layout diagram. This will help you identify where the PCI-E slots are located. Note: Most laptops do not allow you to upgrade the graphics card."

      "title": "Make sure that the card will fit.",
      "content": "Make sure that the card will fit. Many modern graphics cards are quite large and will take the space of two PCI slots in the computer. They can also be fairly tall and long, so you'll need to ensure enough vertical and horizontal clearance. Use a tape measure to note the vertical and horizontal clearance you have available. Nearly all cards will have their dimensions listed in their product descriptions, allowing you to ensure that it will fit before you purchase it."

      "content": "Uninstall your old drivers if switching between GPU brands. One of the biggest potentials for errors and problems stems from driver incompatibility. Before installing your new card, it is highly recommended that you uninstall the drivers that Windows is currently using to display graphics if you're moving from AMD to Nvidia or vice versa. The quickest way to uninstall your drivers is to open the Device Manager and uninstall from there. To open the Device Manager, search for it in the Start menu or press âŠž Win + X and select it from the menu (Windows 8 only). Once in the Device Manager, expand the Display Adapters section. Right-click on your current display adapter and click Uninstall. Follow the prompts to remove the driver from your computer. Your display will likely revert to low quality, with large icons and blurry text. Power down your computer after uninstalling the drivers. If you're staying within the AMD or Nvidia family, you likely will be okay if you don't uninstall your drivers before starting."

      "content": "Ground yourself. Whenever working with sensitive computer components, you should always ensure that you are properly grounded. Electrostatic discharge can damage or destroy your components, rendering them useless. Preferably, you will be using an anti-static wrist strap attached to exposed metal in your case. If you don't have one, you can ground yourself by touching a metal water tap. Make sure that the open computer is not resting on carpet, and that you are standing on tile or linoleum when working inside the computer. Make sure that the computer is unplugged from the wall before you begin working on the insides."

      "title": "Close up your computer.",
      "content": "Close up your computer. After you've verified that the card has been seated properly, secured, and connected to the power supply, you can close up the case. Make sure to connect your display to the new graphics card. If you were using onboard video before, the monitor was likely plugged into the motherboard. To take advantage of your new card, your display will need to be connected to it. For best results, use HDMI or DisplayPort to connect your display to your graphics card. If your monitor or card does not support HDMI or DisplayPort, the next best choice is DVI, followed by VGA."
    },
    {
      "title": "Power on your computer.",
      "content": "Power on your computer. Your operating system will most likely detect the new card and attempt to adjust your display so that it is using the optimal resolution and color depth. Accept the changes and enter the operating system. If your monitor does not display any picture at all, you need to troubleshoot your installation. Check to make sure you have the card properly installed and connected. An irregular, jagged-looking or distorted picture might indicate a problem with your graphics card. Check that your card is installed correctly before contacting the manufacturer."

      "title": "Start up a game.",
      "content": "Start up a game. Before starting to play, explore the game's Video settings menu. Turn all the settings up as high as they can and give the game a whirl. If it performs smoothly, then you're good to go. When setting the resolution, you should always try to keep it at your monitor's resolution. For most flat-screen monitors, this is 1920x1080, though newer monitors have a higher native resolution than that. If the game is choppy or otherwise performing badly, start lowering settings one by one. Don't worry too much if your card can't handle the Ultra settings. Sometimes games come out that don't work right with any card! A game's performance is affected by more than just the graphics card. Your processor, RAM, and even hard disk speed will all play a part in how the game performs."
