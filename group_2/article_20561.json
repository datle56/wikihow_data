      "content": "Try a beginner exercise. Start with a simple exercise like the lateral step-up, for which you will need two 5 pound weights and a step bench (available at sports stores, department stores, and online). Stand with your right side to the bench, a weight in each hand, held in front of your thighs. Step up sideways onto the bench with your right foot and squeeze your glutes. Hold for a count of three, then step back down. Do this 15 times on each side, working up to three full sets. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Do squats . [2] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 October 2019. Position your legs so that they are a little wider than shoulder width, making sure your feet are angled slightly outwards. Lower your body downward as if you’re about to sit on a chair, shifting your weight towards your heels. Hold yourself in this position for 5 to 10 seconds, then lift yourself back up. Do two to three sets of 15 reps. [3] X Research source To modify your squat workout, vary the duration of the exercise — for example, try lowering yourself into a squat more slowly over different intervals (e.g. lower your body into a squat within 2 seconds five times, then lower yourself for a full 5 seconds five times, and so on). Aim to work out your glutes at least 2–3 times a week if you're trying to make them tighter. [4] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 October 2019."

Thrust your hips upwards, lifting your butt until your torso is straight. Hold several seconds, then lower back down. Do three to five sets of 10 – 15 reps. [5] X Research source Add weights to intensify this exercise. Hold weights at your groin to increase resistance. Experiment with the height of your hip lift. You may find you access your glutes better with a low lift of only an inch or two above the mat."

      "content": "Take the stairs. Opt to climb the stairs whenever possible (e.g. in lieu of taking an elevator at work every morning) to add butt-toning exercise to your day. For added benefit, try taking two stairs at a time. Try using a stair climber machine at the gym, which is a good way to get a full stair-climbing workout. Reader Poll: We asked 266 wikiHow readers to tell us their favorite cardio exercise to do at the gym and only 6% of them said the elliptical machine (even though this is known to be a great way to build your glutes, like the stair climber). [Take Poll] The elliptical may not be popular, but it could be your secret weapon for building and shaping your butt!"

While any exercise classes will work towards tightening your butt in the long run, some have more immediate benefits. Spin classes, for example, offer an intensive workout focused on the lower body. You can also try taking ballet classes if you don't like aerobics. [9] X Research source You can also look for classes specifically geared towards butt workouts (e.g. “Booty Kickin’ Step” at Crunch gym in New York City)."

      "content": "Go for a hike. Hiking is an excellent workout — just one hour of moderately strenuous to vigorous hiking burns over 400 calories, toning your legs and butt in the process. When weather permits, look online for hiking trails near you, preferably on hilly terrain for an added challenge to your workout; plot out your route carefully, and be sure to bring a friend with you for safety. Wear sturdy shoes with thick, rubber soles to prevent falls and protect your feet. Bring water, snacks, your cell phone, a first-aid kit, a map, and a light jacket or umbrella in case of rain."
