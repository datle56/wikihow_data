      "content": "Cast on 10 stitches and leave a yarn tail that's 12 inches (30 cm). Get out 1 skein of yarn in the color you'd like the doll's legs and torso to be. Make a slip knot and cast 10 stitches onto size 6 (4 mm) needles. Leave a tail of yarn 12 inches (30 cm) long so you can use it to sew the doll's body. [1] X Research source Most worsted weight skeins are around 364 y/333 m or 7 ounces/198 g. You can use acrylic or wool. Keep in mind that you won't need the entire skein, so you can use smaller balls of yarn."

      "content": "Knit 10 rows knitting every stitch. To make a garter stitch for the first leg, knit each stitch and make 10 rows. When you reach the end of the 10th row, don't cast off the stitches. Instead, cut the yarn and leave a 12 inches (30 cm) tail. [2] X Research source If you would rather make a stockinette stitch, alternate rows of knitting and purling. For example, knit every stitch of row 1, then purl every stitch of row 2. Knit every stitch of row 3, and so on."

Then cast on another 10 stitches to the same needle. [3] X Research source You'll be knitting the 2 legs at the same time which is why you'll keep them on the same needle."

If you chose to do a stockinette stitch, remember to alternate knitting and purling rows. [4] X Research source Don't cut the yarn once you finish the beginning of the second leg. You'll need to use the working yarn to join the legs."

Leave 1/8 in (3 mm) between each stitch and secure the stitches with a lock stitch when you reach the end of the first leg. [11] X Research source To secure the stitch, make a backstitch and create a loop. Pull the yarn through the loop and pull it tight so it makes a knot.
