Alternatively, save up your leftover apple cores and peels over a few days to make apple cider vinegar out of 1-1.5 cups (about 120-180 g) of apple scraps.

      "content": "Add the apples to a sterilized 64 oz (~2 L) glass jar , with cool water. Make sure the water covers the tops of the apple chunks. If you need to, place a smaller sterilized jar on top of the apples to weigh them down and ensure they’re completely covered—any apple bits exposed to air inside the jar may rot and ruin your cider. [3] X Research source For the best results, use filtered water that’s free of any impurities that might affect your cider."

      "content": "Cover the jar with a cheesecloth. As the apples ferment into cider and eventually vinegar, the mixture will still need to be able to breathe. Use a piece of cheesecloth held in place around the mouth of the jar with a rubber band. This will keep any unwanted substances out of the jar, but still let the gasses release during the fermentation process. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the jar in a warm, dark place for 3-4 weeks and stir it once a day. Keep the jar out of direct sunlight and in a room that’s about 60–80 °F (16–27 °C). [5] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Find somewhere that you can leave the vinegar to ferment for a long time, where it won’t be disturbed unintentionally. Keep it at the bottom or on top of your pantry, in a corner of your kitchen, or anywhere else where it won't be exposed to direct sunlight."

When the jar’s contents have a pungent scent similar to that of bottled apple cider vinegar, strain the liquid through several layers of cheesecloth or a coffee filter into a clean container to remove any solids. [6] X Research source If you notice any scum forming on top of the jar, skim it off and discard it. [7] X Research source Also, taste your cider once every couple days by dipping a spoon into the mixture. Look for a sweet but tangy taste, but wait for more or less time depending on your preference."

Open it up every couple days and give it a stir. [8] X Research source During this time, you’ll see a solid film form on the surface. This is the vinegar “mother,” which is a solid formed in fermenting liquids that helps fermentation along.

Use 2 tbsp (0.5 oz) of sugar for every 1.5 cups (180 g) of apple scraps, and add yeast according to the instructions on the packaging.
