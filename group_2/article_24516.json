      "title": "TikTok Shop is legitimate and generally safe to buy from.",
      "content": "TikTok Shop is legitimate and generally safe to buy from. TikTok Shop isn’t one official business—instead, it’s an online marketplace where each item comes from an individual seller. This means you face the same risks as when you shop from a site like Etsy or Depop. It’s important to look for fake storefronts and be careful of scams before checking out. [1] X Research source TikTok uses machine learning models and algorithms to detect potential fraud cases, unsafe content, or violative product listings. [2] X Research source However, some fraudulent activity may slip through the cracks. How safe an item is to buy on TikTok Shop depends on the seller—if it’s a small business where the items are hand-crafted and the reviews look real, it might be a safe purchase."

      "content": "No, but TikTok sellers might steal your information if you provide it. TikTok itself is a secure website that works to prevent unauthorized access to your data. [3] X Research source However, if a seller asks you to give them your bank information or take the transaction off the app, there’s a possibility your information may be stolen. Even though TikTok sellers are vetted before they’re able to put an item online, some fake or misleading listings may make it to your TikTok Shop page. For an individual seller to sign up on TikTok Shop, they have to be at least 18 years old and submit a valid passport and driver’s license. [4] X Research source Corporate sellers have to provide their Business License, Certificate of Incorporation, Company Registration Certificate, and proof of eligibility to sell products on TikTok Shop.

      "content": "TikTok Shop keeps prices low to get more users to buy from them. TikTok primarily makes money by taking a cut of the sales from sellers. They strategically place price drops and discounts to encourage buyers to keep shopping after their first purchase. This allows the company to make even more money after each sale. [6] X Research source In April 2024, TikTok increased the fees they charge sellers from 2% to 6% of the price of each order, which may have increased the prices of the items in TikTok Shop.

      "content": "Some sellers may live in far locations that take longer to ship from. Because TikTok Shop is an online marketplace, the location where the item ships from typically depends on the seller’s location. Sellers must deliver the item to the carrier within 15 days, but the time it takes for the carrier to deliver the package may vary. [8] X Research source To find the seller’s location, click on the seller’s name under the name of the item in TikTok Shop. Their “Business address” is under “Seller information.” [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Shipping times also depend on your item and how the seller ships it.",
      "content": "Shipping times also depend on your item and how the seller ships it. When a customer places an order on TikTok shop, the seller can choose “Ship by TikTok” or “Ship by Seller.” “Ship by Seller” is only available for items requiring installation (like air conditioners) or special handling (like food or flowers), dangerous products like batteries, and bulky or heavy items. [10] X Research source When they “Ship by Seller,” the seller has to package the item and ship it. TikTok requires these orders to be delivered within 15 business days after the order was placed. If they choose “Ship by TikTok,” the seller has to package the item and give it to the recommended carrier or drop-off point 1 to 2 business days after the order is placed. TikTok shipping also only uses FedEx, UPS, or USPS to ship their items, which may affect the shipping time. [11] X Research source Seller shipping, however, can use FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, Amazon Logistics, AxleHire, Better Trucks, Deliver-it, GLS US, Lasership, Lone Star Overnight, OnTrac, Spee-Dee Delivery, TForce, or Wizmo.

[14] X Research source If a TikTok creator pushing the product has turned off their comments, it may be a red flag. Some creators turn off their comments to avoid complaints from unhappy buyers."

You can also do a quick Google search to see if the same product is on Amazon, Etsy, or Shopify, and read the reviews there to see if sellers recommend it. [15] X Research source Even though TikTok Shop reviews are generally safe, there’s still a chance they may be fake. Reviews for a product may be fake if they were all posted on the same day or if they have identical (or near-identical) phrasing.

Check the dimensions, material, return policies, shipping information, and other information about the item to make sure nothing seems out of place. [18] X Research source If you’re buying something you think is new, watch out for words like “refurbished,” “vintage,” or “close-out,” which may indicate that the item is used or defective. [19] X Research source For example, you may buy a mirror that’s advertised as full-size, but upon closer inspection is actually only 1 in (2.5 cm) tall. [20] X Research source Read the return policy in the product’s details carefully before ordering it. Some items may not allow refunds and some sellers may charge a fee for returning an item. [21] X Research source Try to only buy name-brand products directly from the manufacturer—secondhand sellers might offer duplicates for a low price."
