Once you find your desired location, mark the tip and end of the sword on the wall with a pencil. If you want your sword to be the focal point of the room, hang it in the center of your wall. If you're hanging several swords, make sure to place them an even distance apart so that they look uniform."

[2] X Research source Hold the sword up against the wall to see where the hooks will be in relation to the sword. You may have to skip a stud or 2 if you are hanging a long sword. Use a level to draw a line connecting the marks to ensure that you’re hanging your sword straight. If you can't find a stud, use a wall anchor made for the wall material in your room.
