      "title": "Make the lightening mixture.",
      "content": "Make the lightening mixture. Since honey is so sticky, it helps to add some water to loosen it up and make it easier to apply to your hair. Mix four parts honey and one part water or apple cider vinegar (which acts as a conditioner) in a bowl until thoroughly combined. [1] X Research source If you want a more drastic change, you can add a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide to the mixture. This reacts with your hair to bleach it several shades lighter. Don't use peroxide if your hair is black or very dark brown, or it may come out orange. For a reddish-blonde hue, add some henna powder, cinnamon or ground coffee to the mixture. [2] X Research source Adding hibiscus petals will add a strawberry blonde hue. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the honey mixture to your hair. Drape a towel over your shoulders to protect your clothes, then pour the honey mixture over your head in small doses and use your fingers to massage it in. Continue pouring honey onto your hair and working it in until all of your hair is completely covered in honey. You might want to cover your bathroom floor with a towel or washcloth to protect it from drips, since sticky honey can be annoying to clean up. If you added a reddening powder to the honey, don't wear clothes or use towels that might stain red."

      "title": "Cover your hair with plastic and let the honey sit.",
      "content": "Cover your hair with plastic and let the honey sit. Use a shower cap or a few sheets of plastic wrap to cover your hair. Let the honey sit in your hair for at least 2 hours to achieve a lighter look. [4] X Research source If you have long hair that's hard to keep up under the plastic, twist your hair into clips to pin it up while the honey treatment is working, then put the plastic over your clipped up hair. Do not use metal clips if you've added hydrogen peroxide to the honey mixture. There's no need to use a blow dryer to apply heat. The honey works well at room temperature."

      "content": "Keep the honey in your hair overnight for much lighter results. The honey will also act as a deep conditioning treatment if you leave it in for that long. Make sure you sleep wearing a shower cap, and put a towel over your pillow. [5] X Research source Do not keep the honey in overnight if you've added hydrogen peroxide to the mixture."

Stir the conditioner and honey in a bowl until they are thoroughly combined. [6] X Research source Store extra conditioner in an old conditioner bottle for later use. Use the same ratio of honey to conditioner to make a larger batch."

Distribute a small amount through your hair and rinse it out when you're finished. Leave the conditioner in your hair for 5-10 minutes while you finish your. This method is great for refreshing hair that was previously lightened!"
