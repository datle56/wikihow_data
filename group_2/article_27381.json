      "content": "Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of oil into a pan. You can use any cooking oil you prefer, such as coconut oil, olive oil, or canola oil. If your coconut oil is solid, spoon it out to measure it, and it will melt in the pan as you heat it. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the pot over low heat.",
      "content": "Place the pot over low heat. You don't want the oil to heat up too much, as it could burn. Plus, if the oil is too hot, it could destroy your CBD concentrate when you put it in. Keep the pot on the lowest setting. If you want, you can use a candy thermometer or digital thermometer to monitor the temperature. Don't let the oil get above 245 °F (118 °C). You can use a double boiler or slow cooker if you're afraid the oil will get too hot. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure and crush 0.04 ounces (1.1 g) of CBD isolate or concentrate. Use a digital scale to measure out the concentrate. Then, crush the crystals/concentrate until you have a powder. You can use a spoon, a rolling pin, or any flat tool to crush the crystals. You could also use a mortar, and pestle ."

      "content": "Add the powder to the pot and let it heat slowly until it dissolves. Once you dump the powder in, stir it with a spoon. Keep stirring every few minutes until you see the powder has dissolved completely."

      "title": "Cool the oil before storing it.",
      "content": "Cool the oil before storing it. Take the pot off the heat when the powder is fully incorporated. Leave it for about 30 minutes to cool completely, and then pour it in a clean jar that holds about 1 cup (240 mL). Label the jar with the date and the contents of the jar to prevent confusion. You can store it at room temperature, but pick a relatively cool location. It's also a good idea to store it away from light. It will stay good for 2 months. For longer shelf life, place it in the refrigerator, where it may last up to 6 months. Toss it if it gets an odd smell. If it grows mold, you should also toss it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a carrier oil.",
      "content": "Pick a carrier oil. You can use hemp seed oil if you'd like. Other options include olive oil, coconut oil, or canola oil. Basically, any healthy plant-based oil is a good choice for making CBD hemp oil. [4] X Research source You could also try flaxseed oil, avocado oil, sunflower oil, or walnut oil."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 225 °F (107 °C). In a few minutes, you'll be placing the hemp plant in the oven to bake, so it's best to get it started preheating now. That way, it will be ready when you're finished preparing the buds. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Grind up 1 ounce (28 g) of hemp buds. Place the buds into a coffee grinder or food processor. Pulse the plants in the processor to quickly chop them up more finely. Try to get the pieces as fine as you can. [6] X Research source You can find hemp buds online or sometimes in local health food stores. Dried is best. If you don't have a processor or grinder, you can just use a very sharp knife. Mince the plants up as well as you can."

      "content": "Spread the ground buds out on a baking sheet. Any flat baking sheet will do, though aim for a 9 by 13 in (23 by 33 cm) pan or larger. Dump the plants on the baking sheet, and then spread them out into a thin layer. [7] X Research source You can use aluminum foil or parchment paper on the pan if you'd like, but it's not necessary."

      "content": "Heat the bud powder for an hour. Place the pan in the preheated oven and turn on a timer for 60 minutes. When the time is up, check on the powder. It should be a little crisp to the touch, and it should look a little brown. [8] X Research source This process decarboxylates the hemp, which activates the CBD in it."

      "title": "Add 2 cups (470 mL) of oil and the powder to a slow cooker.",
      "content": "Add 2 cups (470 mL) of oil and the powder to a slow cooker. You can also use a double boiler. Pour the oil you picked into the cooker of your choice and then dump the plants in as well. Stir to make sure the powder completely covered in oil. Turn the heat on low to begin slowly warming up the mixture. [9] X Research source You need to use something that provides low heat over an extended period, which is why double boilers and slow cookers are good options. In a double boiler, the water below the oil should be simmering lightly."

      "title": "Let the mixture stew for 2-3 hours on low heat, stirring every 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the mixture stew for 2-3 hours on low heat, stirring every 30 minutes. Come back to the oil every half hour to give it a gentle stir. This also gives you an opportunity to check the color. When it takes on a greenish-brown color, the oil is done, and you can take it off the heat. [10] X Research source You can let it stew for up to 8 hours but make sure to keep the heat very low. You may extract more CBD this way. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Strain the powder out of the oil. Let the oil cool 30 minutes or so before you try to handle it. Set a strainer with cheesecloth or muslin in it over a bowl. Pour the oil through the strainer to filter out the powder. [12] X Research source To get as much oil out of it as you can, gather up the cheesecloth around the powder and squeeze it. Let the oil drip out the bottom."

      "title": "Store the oil in a cool, dark place.",
      "content": "Store the oil in a cool, dark place. Pour the strained oil into a clean jar or container that holds about 2 cups (470 mL). A small canning jar works well for storage. Label the jar with the date and its contents so you don't confuse it with other oil. Place it somewhere relatively cool away from light to help increase its shelf life. [13] X Research source Typically, it will stay good for about 2 months. If you want to keep it for longer, put it in the refrigerator, where it may last as long as 6 months. If the oil has an off smell or it grows mold, it's time to toss it."
