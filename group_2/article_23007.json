      "content": "For a typical breakup, wait at least 30 days to text your ex-girlfriend. According to the famous no contact rule , 30 days is enough time for both of you to get in a better headspace and healthily process your feelings. Plus, when you draw boundaries and give her space to miss you, your ex will start remembering the good times you had together. Sometimes, running into your ex is unavoidable. You might be in the same class or work together. In those cases, try to avoid any long and emotional conversations. If you see your ex during the no-contact period, you don't need to be rude or run away. Acknowledge her and be friendly, keeping all conversation brief and light-hearted. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "After a messy breakup, wait 6 weeks before texting. You and your ex-girlfriend will probably need more time to work through your feelings for longer relationships and more difficult breakups. However, most no-contact periods shouldn't go for longer than 45 days unless you and your ex agree to wait—otherwise, she might move on a little more than you want her to. Spend that time healing and treating yourself with compassion. Regardless of your part in the breakup, you don't need to punish yourself. Practice mindfulness and work to understand your own emotions instead.

      "content": "Hold off on texting until a birthday or holiday after no contact. Look for a special occasion at the end of the no contact period—or the soonest holiday if you've already passed the typical no contact period—and wait to text your ex-girlfriend then. A birthday makes a great excuse to pick up the phone and drop her a quick \"thinking of you\" text, but you can also do this for any holiday she's fond of. It's best to do this if the breakup was mainly on fair terms. A cheerful \"Happy birthday!\" might seem out of place if your last interaction was a big fight."

      "content": "Wait 4-6 weeks after the breakup for your ex to text you first. If you're nervous or unsure about whether your ex-girlfriend wants to hear from you, you could wait for her to text you. That way, you'll know for sure she's ready to talk. Of course, this isn't a perfect solution—if you know that she's shy too, you might have to take the initiative anyway after the no contact period ends. Even if you decide to give your ex a chance to text first, keep track of the amount of time that passes. If it's been more than a couple of months, consider taking the plunge and texting her first.

      "content": "You shouldn't text her right after the breakup. Going through a breakup is upsetting and confusing, but trying to talk to your ex-girlfriend immediately afterward will only add to the turmoil. The amount of time you'll both need to process the breakup is subjective, but anybody should take at least a few days to gather their thoughts before having a productive conversation with an ex."

      "content": "When your ex starts dating again, it's probably time to let her go . It can be tempting to text an ex-girlfriend if you hear that she has a new significant other, but it's not helpful for either of you. Instead, you can use your ex's new relationship as fuel to let go and move on with your life. It's easier to heal once you accept that the relationship is really over between you. [4] X Research source Exes can still be friends , but even that can be awkward when she's starting a new romance at the same time. Either reach out before she starts dating again or wait until her next relationship is firmly established to text her."

      "content": "Try not to text her after 8 PM, as it can send the wrong message. Your ex might think you're just trying to get a booty call if you send late-night texts. The best time to text her is early evening—after work but before 8 PM. If you text later, make your intentions clear and set up a friendly conversation that won't be mistaken for something suggestive. Send your ex a simple and easy \"How was your day?\" or \"How have you been?\" Extra context can also help to show her you're not trying to start anything. You could explain that you're just finishing dinner or got home after a night out and saw something that made you think of her."

You and your ex-girlfriend will need to process any hurt feelings before texting. If you can take stock of your emotions and realize that you're not holding onto any anger or resentment, it might be time to text her. [6] X Research source It's hard to tell how someone feels over text, so take cues from your ex as best you can. If she texts back and seems open to a discussion, keep going. If she asks you not to text for a while, respect her wish—she could still be upset and need time."
