Think of \"a very simple moment\" when your crush did something \"that really touched your heart, but you never told them about it,\" suggests Beck.

Whatever it is, make them feel seen and valued by expressing your admiration for them in your love letter. \"It amazes me how good you are at cross-stitching. You opened my eyes to a whole new skill.\" \"You're such a talented singer. I really hope you start doing concerts soon because I'll be your #1 fan.\""

      "content": "Make up a poem or transcribe one that expresses your feelings. A poem is the perfect thing to write in your love letter when you have trouble getting your feelings onto the page. Poems use literary devices like metaphors, similes, and rhyming schemes to help you express your emotions more meaningfully. If you're not confident about writing a love poem on your own, no sweat! Just look to the greats like Shakespeare or Robert Browning, and copy their words into your letter. (Just remember to give credit where it's due.) \"True love is a durable fire, / In the mind ever burning, / Never sick, never dead, never cold, / From itself never turning.\" Sonnet 40, Shakespeare \"While I am I, and you are you, / So long as the world contains us both, / Me the loving and you the loth, / While the one eludes, the other must pursue.\" Life in a Love , Robert Browning"

It can be anything from adjectives (like \"beautiful\" or \"handsome\") to objects or places. For example, if your partner loves coffee, you might write down words like \"espresso, steam, sweaters, cozy.\" Choose the word associations you like best (or use them all) and write them down in a list in your love letter. \"When I think of you, this is what comes to mind: beauty, grace, princess, Disney, walking, cute sundresses, Converse sneakers.\" \"These words remind me of you: tall, buff, basketball, sweat, ocean, glistening.\""

Look to your favorite books, movies, or Bible verses for quotes that describe your crush, and share them in your love letter. For example, you might choose a verse from the Song of Solomon, which is famous for its poetic descriptions of love and devotion. Or you might opt for a line from classic literature, like when Mr. Rochester describes his love for Jane in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre . \"How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from the hills of Gilead.\" Song of Solomon 4:1 You—you strange, you almost unearthly thing!—I love as my own flesh.\" Jane Eyre , Chapter 23"

It's a hard question to answer because there are probably too many reasons for you to write down! But you don't have to write them all. Just start making a list and then pick the ones that are most important to you. \"[It] could even be entitled, 'All the Reasons Why I Love You,\" says Beck. \"I love you for so many reasons, but especially because of how well we get along together and how we're always a team.\" \"I love you because you don't mind that I play video games a lot, and you put up with all my quirks.\""

Maybe you're remembering how happy they looked on the vacation you took together last summer. Or maybe you're thinking about a romantic gesture they made that was simply unforgettable. Whatever comes to mind, write it down and remind the other person why it was such a special time. \"One of my favorite memories is when we walked on the beach and collected seashells. I felt so at peace.\" \"I love remembering the first time I took you to the movies. You got scared and let me wrap my arm around you so you could hide your face.\""

If so, a love letter can be a great place to share that fascinating tidbit! You can even turn it into a game where you use your love notes to swap interesting secrets. It's a great way to get to know your beloved better, too. \"I've never told anyone this, but when I was 9 years old, I used to sneak snacks into my room and eat them after my parents had gone to bed.\" \"I think we've been together long enough, so I can tell you: I like putting ketchup on my steak.\""

      "content": "Describe the moment you first knew you loved them. In the movies, the main character realizes they're in love suddenly, like a slap in the face. In real life, this feeling tends to come on more gradually. Then there might be a particular moment where we acknowledge this feeling to ourselves, thinking, \"I'm in love with this person.\" If you had such a moment, describe it in your love letter. \"I knew I was in love with you when you said you loved Minecraft.\" \"I knew I would love you forever after that beautiful night we spent talking for hours, just sitting in my car in front of your house.\""

Whether you're in a new relationship or have been together for years, chances are there are still parts of your past life you haven't shared with your partner. A love letter can be a great place to reveal interesting parts of yourself that you don't think they know much about. For example, you can write about how you used to be obsessed with Dungeons and Dragons , or about the jobs you worked during your teenage summers. \"Have I ever told you about the time I went to a Star Trek convention? That was back in my nerd days in high school…\" \"I don't think I've talked much about the time I lived in Boston for 6 months. That's something we could talk about on our next date.\""
