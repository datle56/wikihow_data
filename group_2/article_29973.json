      "content": "Start a game in Creative mode. While you technically can build a TV in Minecraft's Survival mode, gathering the resources to craft the technical components of the television will take an enormous amount of time. If you have an existing world in Creative mode, you can just load that world instead."

      "content": "Find a place to build. If you have an existing structure, you might want to set up the TV in the living room or in an underground basement-type area. Keep in mind that you will need several blocks' worth of space behind and on either side of the TV, however."

      "title": "Create a wall for the TV.",
      "content": "Create a wall for the TV. Place at least a four-by-four wall of blocks in the area in which you want to build your TV. After you have done this, you can proceed with creating the TV's screen."

      "title": "Place a redstone repeater below and behind each piston.",
      "content": "Place a redstone repeater below and behind each piston. Go around to the back of the wall and face the backs of the pistons, then place a redstone repeater one block below and one block behind each piston. If your pistons are more than one block above ground level, you'll have to create a platform for your redstone repeaters."

      "title": "Place a picture on the left piston.",
      "content": "Place a picture on the left piston. Go back around to the front of the wall, select the painting in your equip bar, and place it on the left piston. This will cause the painting to cover both pistons, thus creating your \"screen\". Now you can move on to making the TV's remote. You can remove and reapply the painting if you don't like the image on it."

Keep in mind that redstone can only keep its power for fifteen blocks, so this block \"staircase\" can't be too high."

      "content": "Move the wires underground. If you don't want the redstone \"wires\" to be exposed, dig a trench for them and then build a wall over the top of them.

You can place a tower of jukeboxes around the sides of the TV if you want functional set of speakers, or you can place a speaker-like item (e.g., a Wither Skeleton skull) on either side of your TV. Since the TV itself doesn't actually display a moving image, using ornamental (nonfunctional) speakers are fine here."
