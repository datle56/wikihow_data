      "content": "Create a constellation of 3D paper stars . Take a 12 in (30 cm) square of patterned scrapbook paper and fold it diagonally both ways to crease it. Unfold the paper and fold both sets of straight edges together, then unfold it again. Use a pair of scissors to cut about 2.5 in (6.4 cm) inward from each straight edge and fold the flaps together into triangles. Glue the edges of the flaps together and watch the paper transform into a multi-dimensional star! [1] X Research source Use lots of different colors and patterns of scrapbook paper to build your own dazzling paper solar system. If you want to hang your completed stars, glue 2 stars together on their backsides to make a single star with 8 evenly-spaced points, then attach a string to one of the points and suspend them from the ceiling."

      "content": "Make poseable cardboard animal stand-ups. Draw various animals on a large piece of cardboard, using separate outlines for the body and legs. Cut out the shapes carefully. Use paint to fill in each animal’s features, including details like stripes and spots. Cut small slits at the bottom of each and slide in the leg pieces to make your animals stand up on their own. [6] X Research source Incorporate other types of materials by sticking on googly-eyes and using pipe cleaners for things like tails and horns. When you’re finished, arrange your stand-ups into different scenes, such as barnyards, watering holes, or zoo exhibits."

Complete your rocket by gluing fringed paper, tissue paper, or string to the inside of the bottom part of the tube to mimic flames. [7] X Research source Hang each rocket from a length of string to freeze it in flight, or stake them into the ground at an angle with wooden skewers covered with striped paper drinking straws to make them look like they’re blasting off."

Weave the yarn in and out of the holes in all different directions and slide colored beads onto each section to put your own unique spin on a traditional Native American dreamcatcher. [10] X Research source When you’ve used up all the holes or you’re satisfied with the design you’ve created, snip the yarn and tape it to the back of the frame out of sight. Mix up the colors of your plates and yarn to play around with different themes. Your dreamcatcher might be inspired by suns, flowers, fruits, or even holiday images."

Cut an identical piece from the back of the shirt and pin the edges of both pieces together. Stitch up 3 sides of the pillow, then pause to stuff it full of cotton before sewing the 4th side shut. Another option is to sew overlapping flaps of leftover fabric to the backside of the design on the top, bottom, and outer edge to make a pillowcase that you can slip over a small throw pillow. Ask a parent or teacher for help if you’ve never used a needle and thread before."

After the glue dries, you'll have a chic, useful accessory that will introduce a splash of color to any part of your home. [13] X Research source Wrap the yarn just tight enough to take the slack out of each \"row.\" If you pull it too tight, it could crack fragile containers. Try using multiple colors to give your container a rainbow effect. When you want to change colors, just cut the yarn on the opposite side of the container that you started on, then begin a new strand. [14] X Research source"

[19] X Research source Make sure you use air-dry or polymer clay, which doesn't need to be fired in a kiln in order to harden to its finished form.
