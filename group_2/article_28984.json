      "content": "Print off a fidget spinner stencil. In order for your fidget spinner to spin properly, it will need to be perfectly balanced. While you could measure out a shape or try to draw one yourself, it's much easier to use a stencil to shape your spinner. Look online for a stencil that you can download and print off. [1] X Research source Search for “fidget spinner template” or “fidget spinner stencil” to find a bunch of different shapes and sizes of fidget spinners that you can make. If you have a fidget spinner already, you can use it as a stencil by tracing around the edges."

      "title": "Trace the shape of your spinner onto some cardboard or foam.",
      "content": "Trace the shape of your spinner onto some cardboard or foam. Cut out your chosen fidget spinner stencil and place it onto a sheet of thick cardboard or foam board. Use a pen or pencil to trace around the stencil, being careful not to move it as you draw. [2] X Research source To keep the stencil in place, try pushing a toothpick through the center of it and slightly into the cardboard. The cardboard or foam board you choose should be less than 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. This will be sturdy enough to be a durable spinner, while also being easy to hold in one hand."

      "title": "Cut out your fidget spinner base.",
      "content": "Cut out your fidget spinner base. Use a pair of sharp scissors or a craft knife to cut your fidget spinner base out of the cardboard or foam board. Go around the edges with a pair of scissors to trim away any bumps and make your base as round as possible. [3] X Research source If you're using scissors, it might be easier to cut a square or rectangle around your spinner first. That way you can cut away the extra board from the shape of your spinner, rather than cutting the spinner out. Always be careful when working with sharp scissors or craft knives! Cut away from your hands and work slowly so you don't hurt yourself. You may want to glue printer paper or colored paper to the front and back of your spinner base."

      "title": "Pierce a toothpick through the center of the spinner base.",
      "content": "Pierce a toothpick through the center of the spinner base. Use a ruler and a pencil to measure and mark the exact center of your fidget spinner. Get a toothpick and push it through the middle of the spinner base, so that the base is around halfway up the toothpick. Move it back and forth to get rid of any loose edges around the hole. [4] X Research source You can find the exact center of a 2-prong spinner by measuring the length and width and dividing each by 2. On a spinner with an uneven number of prongs or an irregular shape, draw a straight line through each prong towards the center. The area where they meet is the middle. Putting the toothpick in the exact center of your spinner base will help make sure it is balanced and spins evenly."

      "title": "Wiggle the toothpick around to widen the hole.",
      "content": "Wiggle the toothpick around to widen the hole. In order for your fidget spinner to spin, there'll need to be room around the toothpick for it rotate freely. Wiggle the toothpick in a few small circles around the hole to loosen it. Hold each end of the toothpick between your thumb and index finger and flick the base to make sure it spins properly. [5] X Research source Be careful not to widen the hole too much, as this will make your spinner wobble while it spins. It should be just big enough that it can spin around the toothpick with little resistance."

      "title": "Cut out 2 small circles of cardboard or foam.",
      "content": "Cut out 2 small circles of cardboard or foam. Find a small circular object, such as a penny or another small coin, that can sit comfortably in the center of your spinner. Place it on a piece of cardboard or foam, draw around it, and cut it out. Repeat the process so that you have 2 evenly sized circles. [6] X Research source These circles will be used to hold the toothpick in place and make it more comfortable to hold."

      "title": "Push 1 circle onto each side of the toothpick.",
      "content": "Push 1 circle onto each side of the toothpick. Use a ruler and pencil to mark the center of your circles . Sit the middle of each circle on the tip of each side of the toothpick and push it down towards the spinner base. The circles should be on either side of the base, stuck on the toothpick, and a tiny bit away from touching the spinner base. [7] X Research source The circles being slightly off center on the toothpick won't change the balance of your spinner too much, but it might make it look slightly off balance if your circles are in different places. Be careful not to prick yourself with the toothpick as you push the circles onto it. Make sure that the circle is very close to the spinner base, but not quite touching it.You should be able to see a sliver of light through the gap, but it should be very small."

      "title": "Glue the circles slightly above the spinner base.",
      "content": "Glue the circles slightly above the spinner base. Turn the spinner on its side so that you can see one of the circles easily. Squeeze a little bit of superglue or hot glue onto the top of the circle, right around the edges of the toothpick. Repeat on the other circle to hold both circles in place on the toothpick. [8] X Research source This should keep the circles in place on the toothpick, but still allow the spinner base in the middle to spin freely. Make sure to give the glue plenty of time to dry before using your spinner. Check the instructions on your glue to see how long it needs to dry."

      "content": "Trim the toothpick down to the circles. Trying to hold your fidget spinner by the ends of the toothpick will probably be pretty difficult! Use a pair of sharp scissors or something similar to snip off each end of the toothpick. You should leave a tiny bit of the toothpick to hold the circles in place, but most of it can be cut away. [9] X Research source A pair of wire cutters or something similar will be the easiest way to cut through the toothpick cleanly. You could also use a small file to saw off the end of the toothpick to a smooth finish."

      "content": "Add more circles to cover the toothpick. While the smooth ends of your toothpick might be easy to hold, you can decorate them with some more circles, pompoms, or something similar to make your spinner more colorful and comfortable to use. Glue some small circles or other decorations on top of the toothpick, making sure the spinner can still spin as you do! [10] X Research source Even if you don't want to change the look of your spinner, adding another circle or a soft pom-pom on top of the toothpick end will make it easier to hold."

      "content": "Glue some weights to the end to make it spin faster. The cardboard or foam board used to make your spinner will spin, but adding some weights to the end will make it spin even better! Use a ruler to mark a point the same distance from the edge of each of your spinner prongs. Glue a penny or another small coin onto each of the marks to add some weight to your spinner. [11] X Research source Making sure that your weights are all the same distance from the middle of your spinner will make sure that it is properly balanced and spins evenly."

      "content": "Cover the sides with ribbon to tidy up any rough edges. As it's made out of foam or cardboard, the edges of your spinner might be a little plain or rough. Run a length of ribbon, pipe cleaner, or even a strip of paper around the edge of your spinner and glue it in place. Trim away any excess to make your spinner look even better! [12] X Research source Try contrasting the color of your ribbon or pipe cleaner with the color of your spinner base to make your fidget spinner pop with color."
