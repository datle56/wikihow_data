      "content": "Choose a double walled, clear plastic tumbler . When you select your tumbler, look at the bottom for a sizeable gap between the external and internal plastic layers. A larger gap can make it easier for you to drill into the tumbler and fill it up with glitter. [1] X Research source Choosing a tumbler made with thicker glass, such as Starbucks tumblers , can help prevent any potential cracking or chipping when drilling. Select a size and shape that works best for you! A traditional tumbler shape or a mason jar in a 16, 24, or 32 oz size works great for this craft."

      "content": "Drill a hole through the bottom, outside layer of your tumbler. Position your drill at the bottom edge of the tumbler. Using a 5/16 drill bit, slowly drill a hole through the outer layer of plastic, stopping once you’ve entered the gap between layers. [2] X Research source You might hear a slight popping sound once you drill through the bottom. If you don’t want to drill, use a hot-fix tool to make the hole. Use a 7 mm, concave attachment and gently press the heated tool into the bottom of your tumbler. Hold your tumbler to the side to see when the hot tool enters the gap. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Reverse the drill out of the tumbler and remove any plastic pieces. Slowly reverse the drill to prevent any cracking or damage to your tumbler. It’s likely that some plastic pieces entered the hole and gap as you drilled, so just shake the tumbler upside down to remove them. [4] X Research source Remove any stubborn pieces with a pair of tweezers. When using a hot-fix tool, the plastic hole might not come off all in one piece. If that’s the case with you, simply reheat the hole with the tool and pull out the plastic with a pair of tweezers. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a barrier around the hole with tape. Apply a strip of masking tape around the edge of your tumbler where the hole is. This creates a barrier that helps prevent glitter from spilling over the edge of the tumbler when you pour it into the hole. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour water and your chunky glitter into the hole.",
      "content": "Pour water and your chunky glitter into the hole. Add a splash of water into the hole. Then, place a handful of glitter into the bottom of your tumbler. Gently tap and twist your tumbler to get the glitter to fall inside the hole. Repeat until you have a 1 to 2 inch (2-5 cm) layer of glitter in your tumbler. [7] X Research source Plug the hole with your finger and flip over the tumbler to see how much glitter you’ve added. It’s best to have an even dispersion of glitter in your tumbler. While chunky glitter is recommended, experiment with other glitter sizes! A fine, medium, and chunky glitter mix will give you a lot of dimension and sparkle."

Simply mix the ingredients together with a spoon to create your glitter suspension solution. [8] X Research source Different amounts of glue and water will give you a different look, so play around your ratios! Add more glue for your glitter to fall more slowly, or more water for more glitter movement. Vegetable glycerin is a less thick substitute for glue that gives you more movement in your tumbler."

Then, tap at the bottom of the tumbler to loosen and mix the glitter with the glue solution. Continue adding the solution and mixing the glitter until you reach the top of the hole. [9] X Research source Along with tapping the tumbler, plug up the hole with your finger and shake your tumbler to mix the glitter and glue mixture together."

It’s normal for air bubbles to form as you add the glitter and glue mixture into the tumbler, but you want to remove as many as possible. Just set your tumbler in a location where it won’t get disturbed overnight. Any air bubbles that formed will rise to the hole and disappear. [10] X Research source"

Plug the hole up with your finger or a paper towel and shake the tumbler. If any air bubbles rose to the top of your tumbler as it rested, you might need to add more glue mixture to fill the tumbler back up to the hole. If the glitter isn’t evenly dispersed around the tumbler, add another handful. [11] X Research source"

Squeeze the resin around the hole then slowly fill it in to prevent any bubbles from forming. [13] X Research source Alternatively, use a fast acting, 5 minute epoxy in place of UV resin. Just mix together the epoxy separately, if required, then pour it into the hole. Then let it cure for 5 minutes. [14] X Research source"

Then, cure the resin for 2 minutes. Once cured, your tumbler is finished! [16] X Research source For an extra sparkly touch, add some of your glitter to the resin! Just make sure to even out the glitter so no pieces are poking through the resin. After curing, add another layer of resin and cure it to make sure the bottom is super smooth."
