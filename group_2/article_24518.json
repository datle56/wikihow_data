      "content": "Tumblr is a micro-blogging website, not a dating app. Tumblr sounds similar to Tinder, so you might get the 2 mixed up. While Tumblr is often confused for a dating app, it is actually a social networking site. Users blog about themselves and their interests by creating and posting content in text, image, and video formats. [1] X Research source Unlike traditional blogs, you typically create shorter blog posts on Tumblr and make them more frequently."

      "title": "Tumblr is used to create and share text, photo, and video posts.",
      "content": "Tumblr is used to create and share text, photo, and video posts. When you make a Tumblr account, you create the username of your very own blog. Then, you simply follow other blogs that produce content you’re interested in, whether it’s art, fashion, memes, or fandom-related. You can either reblog existing content to post it on your blog or make your own posts! [3] X Research source While you can certainly get to know people on Tumblr and date them, the primary purpose is to share and post content that interests you. You have to be at least 13 years old to use Tumblr. Your Tumblr account is tied to your blog name or username, not your real name. If you want to find people on Tumblr , you have to know their blog name."

      "content": "Follow blogs that post content you like. Tumblr’s homepage is called your dashboard, which shows you posts from the blogs you follow. To find blogs, click the search bar in the top-right corner of your dashboard and type in topics you’re interested in. This pulls up blogs that post content related to the keyword. Then, simply browse through the blogs and click “Follow” on any that you like. [4] X Research source For instance, you might type “Marvel,” “Taylor Swift,” or “Cats” into the search bar to find blogs you’re interested in. Follow tags that are related to your interests, too. Posts that are tagged with the keyword you follow are also added to your dashboard. Just search for tags the same way you search for blogs. If you know the name of a blog you want to follow, type it in the search bar."

If you really like the post, reblog the content by clicking the arrow button next to the heart. This reposts the content onto your blog. [5] X Research source When you reblog a post, you have the option to add a comment, hashtags, or tag a specific user. Or, share the post on a different social media site. View all of your past likes by clicking “Account” on your dashboard and then clicking “Likes.” Content you reblog is available for everyone to see. To increase your privacy, adjust your account settings so your blog is only searchable if someone has a Tumblr account. [6] X Research source"
