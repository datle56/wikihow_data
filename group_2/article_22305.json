      "content": "Embracing your heart’s passions will reinvigorate your soul. Many of us have learned to replace our passions with duties and obligations. If you have neglected your passions in favor of your sense of duty, you may be starving your soul. Make time each day to do something you are passionate about or that brings you genuine pleasure. If you don't know what your passions are, now is your time to start exploring the possibilities. The best way to figure out what brings you joy and meaning is by being curious. [1] X Research source So, what are you curious about? What brings you delight? Pursue that fearlessly, whether it’s painting or writing or soccer."

      "content": "Meditating will help you cultivate your intuition—the language of the soul. Meditation is an effective way to quiet your mind and allow your soul to speak. Cultivate a daily meditation practice by setting aside time—whether it’s in the morning or afternoon or evening—to intentionally silence your thoughts and focus on your breath. Just 10 minutes of meditation every day has been proven to increase a person’s happiness and invigorate their soul.

      "title": "Your emotions connect you to your soul.",
      "content": "Your emotions connect you to your soul. Journal about any emotions that have been bottled up inside you. What lies beneath your feelings is your creativity, passions, intuition, and imagination. It can be painful to feel and accept uncomfortable emotions like anger, hurt, disappointment, and fear. But when you do, you'll create a more harmonious space for your soul to dwell. Journaling isn't the only way to connect with your emotions: artmaking in general is a wonderful way to dive deep into your own heart. Consider dedicating a few hours to painting , making music, or writing poetry and see what emotions flow from you. You may find the process cathartic and healing. You shouldn't have to carry around heavy, negative feelings day in and day out. Give yourself permission to release them, because you deserve to feel at peace. Reader Poll: We asked 222 wikiHow readers what form of creative expression best distracts them from negative thoughts, and 44% of them said writing, drawing, or painting to channel emotions into art.

      "title": "One of the most effective ways to heal your soul is to try to heal others.",
      "content": "One of the most effective ways to heal your soul is to try to heal others. Ask yourself every morning; \"What can I do today to help someone?\" \"How can I serve?\" \"Who could I call to lift their spirits?\" When you give out of service and unconditional love, you feed and heal your soul. Being kind, loving, and supportive of others is its own reward. Look into opportunities in your area to get involved and help out. Maybe there are volunteer organizations you can get involved in that align with your passion or values, like shelters, churches, mutual aid programs, clinics, and more. Consider inviting a friend or 2 for companionship. Be sure to take steps to attend to your soul as well: serving others can help mend your soul, but don’t use service as a distraction from your own healing."

      "title": "Quality rest may help energize your soul.",
      "content": "Quality rest may help energize your soul. If you're feeling depleted and soul-weary, the answer (or part of the answer) may lie in a good night's sleep. Not only will giving your body the rest it needs help you feel calmer, happier, and more at peace, but you may be able to process difficult emotions in your dreams, which can leave your soul feeling lighter. Aim to get at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night. If your body doesn't feel rested after 8 hours, it's possible you need 9 or 10 hours to feel truly energized. Give yourself permission to move slow and take your time this week as your soul recuperates; it's worth it."

      "title": "Sometimes we just can't do it on our own.",
      "content": "Sometimes we just can't do it on our own. And that's the way it's meant to be: none of us was meant to live and thrive in solitude, and we all need help sometimes. If you're finding you can't heal your soul on your own, it might be worth speaking to a therapist or a turning to a spiritual advisor for advice. They may be able to offer you wisdom and comfort that will lift your soul again. If your soul is suffering from past hurt or trauma, you likely won't be able to just \"undo\" the pain through prayer, meditation, rest, and service: these may help to alleviate some of the symptoms of a broken soul, but some problems need to be treated at the root, and a therapist or spiritual counselor may be able to help. Believe that you deserve to heal and to feel at peace again. Seeking support is perhaps the best thing you can do for yourself and your soul."

      "title": "Invest in your spiritual beliefs.",
      "content": "Invest in your spiritual beliefs. Physical pain can hurt deeply, but spiritual pain is often worse, because there’s no doctor to “fix” your spiritual pain. If your soul feels weak or weary, draw closer to whatever Divine being you believe in. Spend time reigniting your spirituality by engaging in traditions that draw you closer to whoever or whatever energy or entity you call Divine. Pray or read scripture, attend church, rely on crystals for their magical properties—whatever spiritual and religious traditions bring you closer to the Divine, make time for them today. If you practice a certain religion, be sure it aligns with your spirituality. While religion is a means of sharing and practicing your beliefs with a group, spirituality refers to your personal sense of peace and purpose, and if your religious practices clash with your personal spirituality, this may cause your soul some anguish.
