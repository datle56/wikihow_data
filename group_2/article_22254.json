      "content": "Soak the affected area in warm water to soften the blister. One method to soothe your pain and help the blister drain naturally is to simply soak the affected area. Use a clean bowl or sink and fill it with enough warm water to cover the area (your foot or hand, for example). [2] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source Soak the area for 15 minutes. Pat the area dry thoroughly with a dry, clean towel when you're done. The warm water will soften the skin at the top of the blister, which can help the blister drain on its own."

      "content": "Cushion the affected area with moleskin. If your blister is in a spot that receives pressure, such as the bottom of the foot, you might want to cushion the area with a piece of moleskin. Moleskin is a soft cotton fabric, typically with an adhesive backing. This will relieve some discomfort. It can also help protect the blister. [3] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source Cut a piece of moleskin a little bigger than your blister. Cut away the center so that it fits around the blister like a donut. Stick this to the blister. You can also try other adhesives, like Blist-O-Ban and Elastikon. A simple bandage or gauze pad will also work well."

      "title": "Let your blister breathe.",
      "content": "Let your blister breathe. For most blisters, especially smaller ones, exposure to air will help the healing process. Give your blister some air. If the blister is on your foot, take care not to let dirt get on the blister. You may need to wait until bedtime before you uncover your blister. Let the affected area air out overnight while you're sleeping. Sun exposure can delay the healing of your blister or put you at risk of scars or discoloration, especially if your blister is from a burn. [4] X Research source While a little bit of sun exposure is okay, you should cover the blister with a bandage or protective clothing if you plan to be out in the sun for more than 15 minutes."

[12] X Research source You may want to use some antibiotic cream or petroleum jelly on the blister for the first day or 2. If your blister starts to itch or develop a rash, stop using the cream. If there is a flap of skin from the blister, don't trim it. Leave it alone, letting it lie flat over the blister. Clean and re-bandage the area every day. If the area gets wet, change your bandage. Let the area breathe at night by removing the bandage. Replace the bandage in the morning if the blister still needs to heal. This will help protect it from getting dirt in it."
