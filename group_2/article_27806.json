      "title": "Visit your local library.",
      "content": "Visit your local library. To fully understand the problems facing your community, you must make an effort to explore its past. Your local library is an excellent place to start such a study. Ask a librarian for help in finding books, news records and other resources regarding the history of your neighborhood, town or city. Try to answer questions such as: When, and by whom, was the community founded? What businesses, cultures, religions, or political movements were influential in the founding of the community? How has the population of the community changed over time? Has it grown or shrunk? Has it become more or less wealthy? How did major events in the world, such as wars or financial crises, affect the community and its residents? How has the role of the community in the larger region changed over time? For example, many communities suffer serious consequences when once prominent industries or businesses (railroads, manufacturing plants, etc.) closes or leaves the region."

      "title": "Get the perspective of community members.",
      "content": "Get the perspective of community members. Don't limit your exploration of your community's history to written materials. Other members of your community are wonderful resources, especially elder members of your community. Talking with someone who has lived through the changes in your community can provide an intimate perspective into the community's history. Make a habit of asking those who have lived in your community for a long time about their lives and memories. You can ask questions like: [8] X Research source What big changes have occurred in the community during their life? Has the state of the community improved or become worse in recent times?

      "title": "Investigate the causes of violence in your community.",
      "content": "Investigate the causes of violence in your community. One way to address the violence in your community is to identify the driving forces behind the violence. These may include things like a lack of jobs, which might be causing members of the community to turn to violence for survival. Or, the cause might be a lack of family support, which might be causing kids to spend more time on the streets. By investigating the potential causes of the violence in your community, you can work on some tailored solutions to the violence. For example, a lack of jobs might be due to poor educational opportunities for people in your community. Therefore, improving educational opportunities might be the best way to prepare people for jobs and cut down on violent crimes. Or, if many of the kids in your community spend their spare time on the streets, then building a community center or increasing the programming at a local community center may provide the kids with somewhere to go after school."

      "content": "Make a plan with your neighbors to deal with violent situations. This is a great way to start organizing your community, and will help promote unity and communication. What you talk about and plan for will depend on your particular community, but here are some suggestions: [9] X Research source Discuss how more vulnerable community members, such as elders, can be cared for and protected from violence. Arrange carpooling or offer to escort those who need to leave their home, but are fearful to go out alone. If children are present in the neighborhood, have a frank discussion with your neighbors about where the children can gather should they find themselves in danger."

      "title": "Find out what has worked for other communities.",
      "content": "Find out what has worked for other communities. If your community is experiencing significant problems with violence and social unrest, then it might be a good idea to find out what measures have helped other communities. There are likely several things that will need to happen before things improve, but finding out what worked and what did not may help you to generate ideas for your own community. Try looking into violence prevention nonprofits for help and information. While the availability of such programs depends on where you live, thousands of organizations exist to assist communities struggling with violence and unrest. Contacting a local anti-violence or community organizing nonprofit is a great way to find out about what others are doing to make positive changes in their communities."

      "title": "Talk to those around you about the causes of violence.",
      "content": "Talk to those around you about the causes of violence. It is important for you to get as complete a perspective as possible, but remember that unrest in a community often has many causes, all interacting in a complicated way. Always be open to new explanations and perspectives. [10] X Research source Be open and honest in discussing issues of violence with your family, friends and neighbors. Conversations about such important, urgent issues can become heated, but do not shy away from disagreement. Instead, try to listen to what others have to say, and try to understand their perspectives before responding. Community leaders such as religious or school officials, business owners, community organizers, and local politicians are another great resource. Ask about other people's personal experiences with violence, or other community issues. Ask them what they think has caused these issues, and what they think should be done to solve them."
