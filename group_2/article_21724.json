      "content": "Use a tension rod to put curtains between the cornice and the blinds. The cornice is an ornamental type of padding that is used to disguise the tops of blinds; they’re often made of plastic or covered with fabric. If you look between the cornice and the blinds, you’ll see that there is space to suspend a tension rod between the 2 sides of the cornice. You can hang curtains from the tension rod and install them within minutes. [1] X Research source Depending on the setup behind the cornice, you could even use a wooden dowel to hang the curtains. If your blinds don’t have a cornice, you could make one yourself to elevate the look of your room even more. With a tension rod, you don't have to drill into the wall.

      "content": "Opt for hook-and-loop fastener for a no-drill option to attach stationary curtains. Wipe down the inside of the cornice that is covering your vertical blinds to remove any dust or grime. Attach one side of the hook-and-loop fastener to the cornice and the other side to the top of the exterior of the curtains. Take your time and make sure that the strips of hook-and-loop fastener are lined up evenly. Once you’re done, attach the curtains to the cornice. Choose 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) wide hook-and-loop fastener for sheer curtains. Pick a wider hook-and-loop fastener for heavier material. The one downfall of using hook-and-loop fastener is that you won’t be able to slide your curtains back and forth. But, if you’re mainly interested in the aesthetic rather than the functionality, this shouldn’t be a problem."

      "content": "Install brackets on the cornice to hang curtains in front of the blinds. Buy a set of outside-mounting brackets and a curtain rod . Place the brackets close to either end of the cornice and adjust their settings so that they are firmly holding onto the cornice. Hang the curtains from the curtain rod, and then place the curtain rod in the bracket to complete your project. [3] X Research source You’ll be able to move your curtains back and forth with this method. This is a great option for renters or for people who can’t or don’t want to drill into their walls. The most popular bracket is called the “NONO bracket.” It’s super easy to install and doesn’t require any extra tools. There are other similar products you can buy online or at the hardware store."

      "content": "Remove the cornice and install curtain rods for a fully mobile setup. Use a screwdriver to remove the cornice and its hardware from the wall. Then, measure for the curtain rods and drill into the wall at the appropriate spots. Put the curtains onto the curtain rod and hang them from the brackets. [4] X Research source If you’re a renter, put the cornice into storage somewhere safe so you can replace it if you move out."

      "title": "Decide on a hanging method before you measure for the curtains.",
      "content": "Decide on a hanging method before you measure for the curtains . The type of hanging method you use will determine how wide your curtains need to be. For example, if you’re using a tension rod, the curtain will simply extend from one end of the window to the other. But, if you’re installing a curtain rod, you could make the curtains wider than the window itself. Remember, you can always hem curtains that are too wide, but you can’t make them wider."

      "title": "Measure the width of the area you want to be covered by the curtains.",
      "content": "Measure the width of the area you want to be covered by the curtains. Get a tape measure, a pen, and a piece of paper. Extend the tape measure from either one end of the window to the other, or from where you want the curtain to start and stop. Write the measurement down on your piece of paper and label it “width.” [5] X Research source If the curtains are going to extend out past the window itself, it could be helpful to make a mark on the wall in pencil on either side where you want the curtain to fall. That way, you won’t have to keep remeasuring when it comes time to install the curtains."

      "title": "Stretch the measuring tape from the top of the blinds to the bottom windowsill.",
      "content": "Stretch the measuring tape from the top of the blinds to the bottom windowsill. This measurement gives you the minimum length that the curtain will need to cover, though it’s very common for curtains to extend further down past the bottom of the windowsill. If the top of the window is too tall for you to reach, use a step-stool. [6] X Research source Write this measurement down on your piece of paper as “minimum length.”"

      "title": "Measure the distance from the floor to the top of the vertical blinds.",
      "content": "Measure the distance from the floor to the top of the vertical blinds. If there is something beneath the window frame that you don’t want to obstruct, like a vent or a piece of furniture, measure from the top of that object instead of from the ground. In general, curtains do look best when they reach nearly to the ground, but it’s okay if you need to make modifications. [7] X Research source This measurement is important so that you don’t purchase curtains that are too long for the space."

      "title": "Buy curtains that are at least as big as your minimum measurements.",
      "content": "Buy curtains that are at least as big as your minimum measurements. Most curtains, unless you have them custom-made, come in a range of standard sizes. If you can’t find the exact length and width that you want, always opt for the next biggest size. If needed, you can always have the curtains hemmed to fit properly. [8] X Research source If you get curtains that are a bit too small for the window, the room will end up looking strange."

      "content": "Maximize natural sunlight with sheer curtains. If you love spending time in natural sunlight, using sheer curtains will allow you to have some privacy while still enjoying the natural light, even when the vertical blinds are pulled back. Just remember to extend the vertical blinds at night so that your neighbors can’t see into your home. [9] X Research source Thankfully, curtains are fairly easy to change out, unless you’re using the hook-and-loop fastener method. If you are using the hook-and-loop fastener method, hold your curtains up in front of the window to see if you like the way they look before you attach them to the cornice. Sheer curtains are super lightweight, making them a great option to hang from curtain rods or hook-and-loop fastener."

      "content": "Reduce noise and light with heavy black-out curtains. Black-out curtains are great for bedrooms, nurseries, or rooms that tend to get too hot during the day because of the sunlight. They can help you sleep better, and they can even help reduce your electric bill since you won’t have to pay as much for air conditioning. [10] X Research source Black-out curtains normally come in darker shades, like black, navy blue, maroon, gray, and forest green, though there are some shades of cream that you can buy, too. Keep in mind that black-out curtains will be too heavy for a tension rod or hook-and-loop fastener. They will work best with an actual curtain rod."

      "content": "Create visual contrast in a room with patterned curtains. There are hundreds of different styles of curtains to choose from, so you will be able to find something that matches your style. Patterned curtains can bring together a space. [11] X Research source For example, curtains with bright red and yellow flowers could look very appealing in a room with gray-upholstered furniture or a space with a lot of dark wood. The splashes of color would brighten up the room. Browse your local home goods store to see what kinds of patterns and colors are available. Think about the style you already have in the room where they’ll be hanging, and try to pick something that will enhance what you already have."

      "content": "Balance a bright room with neutral-colored curtains. If your walls are covered with art and your furniture pieces are loud and bright, some toned-down curtains might be functional without adding to the visuals of the room. Light grays and creams are great options for a classic look. [12] X Research source For example, cream-colored curtains would look elegant in a bedroom with bright walls and artwork. You can also use lighter-colored curtains in a room that is already fairly neutral. This will help create a calm space."
