      "content": "You’re still talking to your ex. One reason you might be missing your ex is because you’re constantly being reminded of them. Whether you’re seeing their posts on social media or still texting them, it can be easy to start thinking about how much you miss them if they still have a large presence in your life. While cutting them out of your life completely can be a scary thought, constantly being reminded of them may not be helping you move on either. [1] X Research source You might also still see them on a daily basis if you share the same friend group or are a part of the same social circle."

      "content": "You’re feeling lonely. When someone as significant as a partner leaves, it’s natural to feel lonely. You and your ex probably spent a lot of time together, whether it was going on dates frequently or actually living together. Feeling lonely is completely valid, and it’s important to recognize that it might take some time to fill the hole they left behind. [2] X Research source In an abusive or toxic relationship, your ex might have intentionally tried to isolate you from people you were once close to, like your friends or family. This can make your loneliness feel even worse after a breakup. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "You’re not allowing yourself to grieve. Just like any other kind of loss, a breakup can be painful and often requires a period of grieving to truly move on. However, if you simply tell yourself to “Get over them” and “Hurry up and move on,” you’re not allowing yourself to grieve your loss in a healthy way. This might lead you to miss them even more since you haven’t yet fully come to terms with the end of your relationship and what that means for you.

Now that they’re gone, you might feel like your world has been turned upside down and everything might just feel strange. In this case, you may be missing the familiarity and routine you had with them more than you actually miss them.

      "content": "You didn’t get any closure. If your breakup happened out of the blue, it’s natural to feel a little lost and like you never truly got closure. They might have given you an extremely vague reason for ending things, or maybe the breakup felt very impersonal. Because of that, you might have lots of ruminating thoughts and constantly be thinking about what went wrong. With this lack of closure, it can be really hard to move on. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "You only remember the good times. It’s natural for any relationship to have a mix of good and bad moments. However, after breaking up with your ex, you might find yourself only focussing on the good memories you have of them. If you only remember them in the best light, it’s easy to tell yourself that you miss them and what you had. [7] X Research source If you were in an abusive relationship, you may be dealing with the aftereffects of trauma bonding. This is when an abuser alternates between hurting their partner and making up for it with affection and care. The reason you might be missing an abusive partner is that you’re only remembering the times they showed such care and concern for you."

This might be especially true if you were in a toxic relationship where your partner acted selfishly and always put their needs above yours. [8] X Research source In that case, you might have come to depend on them in many ways. You might also be having a hard time defining your sense of self after your breakup. If you were in a toxic relationship, your ex might not have given you a lot of room to explore your own interests, and you might have mostly found purpose in being with them."

Unfortunately, a toxic and abusive partner isn’t above making belittling comments to control the relationship and get what they want. While you were together, they might have said things that made it seem like they were the only ones who would ever love you and that no one else will want you in the future. Now, you might be missing them because you believe there’s no one else out there who could love you like they did. [9] X Research source"

[13] X Research source If you don’t feel ready to delete them from social media, at least avoid interacting with their posts. Don’t like or comment on their posts and avoid making any posts that include them. If your ex won’t stop contacting you, change your phone number to give them one less way to reach you. If you and your ex are in the same social circle, take a break from group activities if you know they’re going to be there. If your ex is giving you mixed signals, like sending you gifts after the breakup, set boundaries with them and try not to engage.
