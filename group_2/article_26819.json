      "content": "Heat enough oil to submerge the food. Use a deep, heavy-bottomed pot that will heat the oil evenly. In most cases you'll need an inch or two of oil to submerge the food you're frying. Place it over medium-high heat and allow it to heat for several minutes. To test whether it's ready, use a fry thermometer to take the temperature of the oil. Once it reaches 350°F (176°C), it's ready to fry. Choose a high smoke-point oil. Peanut, canola, vegetable and grapeseed oils are all suitable for frying. You want to use an oil that can be heated to a high temperature without smoking. [3] X Research source If you don't have a fry thermometer, don't use a meat thermometer. Instead, test the oil by placing a small piece of food in the pot. If it immediately starts to sizzle and turn brown, the oil is ready. [4] X Research source Cooking food before the oil is ready will result in the batter sliding off. The food will turn out greasy and wet instead of moist on the inside and crispy on the outside."

      "content": "Fry until golden brown. Place enough pieces of battered food into the pot to evenly cover the bottom of the pot. Avoid overlapping food, since this will result in uneven cooking. Fry until the food is golden brown on both sides, then place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cooking times will vary depending on what you're frying. Vegetables typically need no more than three or four minutes in the pot. Smaller pieces will require less time. Raw chicken or fish may require five to fifteen minutes' frying time, depending on how big your pieces are and whether they have bones. The center of the meat should be opaque when it is fully cooked. If the oil seems to be browning and burning the outside of the food before the inside is cooked, turn down the temperature. You want to try to keep it at a steady 350°F (176°C)."

      "title": "Dip the food in flour before battering.",
      "content": "Dip the food in flour before battering. Dipping the food in flour first will help this rather liquidy batter stick to the food instead of sliding off. Coat the food with flour on all sides. Tap it on the edge of the bowl to remove excess flour. Use a fork to dip the food pieces in batter to coat on all sides. Shake off the excess batter before frying. Having a lot of extra batter in the pan can cause the temperature in the pot to drop, making the food pieces cook unevenly. That's why it's important to shake off excess batter."
