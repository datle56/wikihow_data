      "content": "Get healthy. Many stars have bad bone structure, crooked features or an overlarge nose, and still manage to look like a reasonably attractive person because they are fit and glowing with health. If you are anorexic, bulimic, or exercising too much, you'll really look unhealthy and you won't have the look. If you're consuming 5,000 calories a day, never exercising, and/or letting yourself go, then you will be unhealthy and thereby unglamorous as well. Go on an ideal weight website, and calculate your ideal weight for your age and height. You should be within 12 pounds of this weight. If not, ask a doctor whether or not yours is a healthy weight."

      "content": "Consider losing a few pounds. If you are more than 9 pounds above your healthy weight, you may want to do something about it. The trick is not doing too much dieting or exercising excessively. Limit yourself to a maximum of two hours of exercise a day, but you probably only need around 15-60 minutes. Further, eat at least 1,300 calories a day if you don't play a sport or 1,700 if you do. Eat what you think is appropriate. Weight watchers is a good diet plan, but only your doctor can prescribe something that is 100% likely to work for you."

If you're not curvy, don't wear clothes that will bag up in those areas. You can rock almost anything if you are skinny and flat. If you're skinny with curves, you can rock anything at all. If you're plumper, and without curves wear clothes that cinch at the waist to give the illusion of curves. Don't be afraid to wear skirts. Wear tops that have ruffles along the bust. If you're plumper with curves, also look for clothes that cinch at the waist and try curvy cut jeans or skirts that cinch at the waist. If you a medium without curves, you can get away wearing lots of clothes. Avoid very low cut tops and curvy cut jeans. Try straight leg or skinny jeans. Try ruffled tops, and belts at your hips."

By first pulling half-up, your ponytail is given a slightly different style, and more volume that will stay. Two braids, half-up, and side-parted are also some things to try. If your hair is short, try clips or a headband."
