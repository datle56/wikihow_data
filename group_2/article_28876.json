      "content": "Place the cupcakes on the top layer. If wished, you can also add to the base layer but if you don't have enough cupcakes, that's fine, just use the top layer only, as this is the layer which draws the eye."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a base.",
      "content": "Create a base. For the base, use a flat piece of cardboard, plastic, or a thick cutting board. It can be in any shape - square, circle, or heart-shaped, provided it's solid and pretty. Some stores sell cake bases that could serve as a suitable base for the cupcake stand. These are usually very cheap to buy and come already wrapped in gold or silver foil."

    {
      "title": "Cover the base if needed.",
      "content": "Cover the base if needed. Cover the base with wrapping paper, foil or another type of covering to improve its appearance. This step isn't necessary if the base is already in great condition and looks nice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose the layers.",
      "content": "Choose the layers. Basically, choose plates and platters that are lightweight and strong. They should ideally decline in size as they go up the stand, so choose something like a dinner plate for the first layer, a side plate for the next layer, a cake plate for the next layer and a saucer for the final layer. Match the plates or mix them up. If you have plates with pretty patterns, eclectic matching won't matter. Plain white or silver platters are always a safe bet when you want a neutral look. For the top layer, where you place only one layer, an unwanted CD is a clever item to use. You can leave it unwrapped (but do wash it first in warm, soapy water), or cover with paper or fabric."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the pillars to hold the layers.",
      "content": "Make the pillars to hold the layers. Here is where you get to have quite a bit of artistic license. Choose whatever is strong and likely to look nice. Most importantly, the item must be safe for use around food, it must not take up too much room on the plate, it must be balanced and it must decline in size as it goes up the layers, just like the plates do. Some great examples of things to use as pillars between the layers include: a glass, cup, eggcup, fabric-covered cleaned out can, vase, sugar bowl, etc. An example of layering could be: First pillar vase, second pillar a glass, third pillar a sugar bowl and final pillar an eggcup."

      "title": "Arrange the pillars and layers.",
      "content": "Arrange the pillars and layers. Place the base layer down in the area where it'll stay. This stand won't be moved once made. Add the first pillar. Then carefully balance the next layer. Continue adding pillars and balancing layers. Anytime something seems wobbly or uncertain, try a different pillar or layer object in its place to see what sits more soundly."

      "title": "Find two cake stands.",
      "content": "Find two cake stands. They can be the same size or different. If different, the smaller stand sit atop the larger one. If you want to make the stand complementary with a table theme or your favorite tea set, etc., you'll need to be a little more picky about the colors and patterns of the stands and base layer. If in doubt, plain white and plain metals are safe choices. (But nobody much minds eclectic placement when the stands are pretty and have heirloom quality.)"

    {
      "title": "Assemble.",
      "content": "Assemble. This is easy and fast: Assemble in place, so that you don't have to move the cupcake stand once put together. Place the base layer down. If using doilies underneath, make sure the doilies are already securely in place. Place the first cake stand on the base layer. Center the stand's leg in the middle of the base layer. Place the next cake stand on the first cake stand. If using different sizes, this should be the smaller of the two. Again, center it. Fill with cupcakes, using the base layer and the two cake stand layers. Done. It will look wonderful but don't be surprised if the cupcakes steal all the attention!"
