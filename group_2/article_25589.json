      "title": "Pain or pressure in the body",
      "content": "Pain or pressure in the body Some people experience painful sensations during a Kundalini awakening, especially near their chakra centers. This may be a result of the Kundalini energy encountering trauma or blocked energy in the body as it uncoils. [5] X Research source You may also experience pressure near your chakras, like in the center of your forehead or around your heart. This may manifest as a headache. Some people report symptoms of autoimmune conditions like CFS or fibromyalgia after a Kundalini experience. If this occurs, it may be triggered by an adrenal response.

      "content": "Improved health Some people report that a Kundalini awakening helped them heal faster from illnesses or improve chronic pain. Some simply say that Kundalini helps them feel stronger and healthier. This may be a result of the Kundalini energy helping to remove blocked energy that was contributing to those conditions. [8] X Research source It’s important to remain under your doctor’s care for any ailments that you’re being treated for. Even if you start to feel better, don’t stop taking any medications or end treatment unless your doctor advises it."

      "title": "Emotional swings",
      "content": "Emotional swings You may experience deep emotions when your Kundalini awakens. You might find yourself crying, laughing, dancing, or contemplating long-forgotten experiences. Some people think this is because the Kundalini energy brings up buried emotions and trauma so you can process them—and in the case of negative emotions, start to heal from them. [9] X Research source Some people may struggle with feelings of anxiety, grief, or fear as Kundalini awakens. This may be due to the pain of releasing old beliefs. This can be an intense and sometimes difficult part of a Kundalini awakening. It may help to journal about what you’re experiencing, or you may want to seek the help of an experienced and compassionate spiritual leader. The flood of emotions isn’t always negative—some people experience intense bliss and contentment as part of a Kundalini awakening."

You may also experience restlessness or insomnia. Fortunately, these sleep changes are usually temporary. [10] X Research source You might also notice that you have vivid dreams, or you may even begin lucid dreaming, where you maintain some awareness and control over your dreams. Dreams of snakes are common—Kundalini energy is often represented as a snake. [11] X Research source People also report dreaming of cats, which may represent divine male energy—a counterpoint to Kundalini. Dreams are often symbolic during a Kundalini awakening, so spend some time meditating on them after you wake up to try to draw out any hidden meanings."

      "title": "Increased sensitivity",
      "content": "Increased sensitivity After a Kundalini awakening, you may notice that you’re more emotionally sensitive, or you might feel more sensitive to other people’s emotions. You may also feel more sensitive to loud noises or bright lights, sometimes to the point of overstimulation. This may occur because your body is learning to interact with the world in a deeper way, so you feel things more intensely. [12] X Research source You may see colors more vividly. [13] X Research source You might feel the pain of others, or even like you’re experiencing the pain of the entire world. These intense feelings usually fade over time. Meditation and grounding exercises can be an effective way to learn to cope in the meantime."

    {
      "title": "Shifting priorities",
      "content": "Shifting priorities As your Kundalini energy awakens, you may find that your spiritual experience causes you to prioritize things differently in your life. For instance, you may no longer be concerned with material goals. This can be a positive change if you embrace it. You may find it easier to say “No” to things that you don’t want to do, or to say “Yes” to things that push you out of your comfort zone. It’s important not to deprioritize things like work or taking care of your household. If your Kundalini awakening reveals to you that it’s time for a career change, for instance, you might start taking classes or working on a business plan before you quit your current job."

You may feel a deeper sense of compassion, and you may sense a connection to God or the Source of Life—or you may sense its presence in everything and everyone around you. [14] X Research source Feeling more connected to others may make it easier to communicate with them. For most people, this brings a feeling of awe and wonder. However, some people find that this feeling of oneness makes them question their place in the universe. Grounding exercises, meditation, and working with a spiritual mentor can help you manage any feelings of overwhelm that occur as part of this experience. As you start to sense your connection to everything around you, you may experience a profound sense of acceptance and deep love for the universe and others. This might be accompanied by a feeling that you’re called to serve others and a deep opposition to violence."

      "title": "Deeper intuition",
      "content": "Deeper intuition Tapping into Kundalini energy may help heighten your intuition. You may feel more in tune with the emotions and energy of the people around you. This can sometimes be overwhelming, but it helps if you can learn to observe these emotions and energies without being affected by them. [15] X Research source Sometimes this manifests as feeling uncomfortable when you’re around another person. This may be a sign that your energies are in opposition to each other.

      "title": "Feeling disconnected or fragmented",
      "content": "Feeling disconnected or fragmented A Kundalini awakening can shake up your sense of self. As you begin understanding your place in the universe, you might feel detached from your former sense of self. You may also feel alienated or distanced from others, or like nothing has meaning. [18] X Research source These are all part of the transformative power of Kundalini energy. If you’re struggling with your sense of self or your connection with others, talk to a friend or mentor, and follow our practices for a healthy Kundalini awakening . In this disoriented state, some people will experience feelings of grandiosity, like they are called by a higher power. It’s important to temper this with grounding practices and a supportive community."

      "title": "Go slowly and be patient with yourself.",
      "content": "Go slowly and be patient with yourself. While some Kundalini awakenings happen spontaneously, many are the result of a dedicated yoga or meditation practice. Start slowly, with simple meditations or beginner-friendly yoga poses. This will help ease the process and prepare you for the deeper experience of a Kundalini awakening. [19] X Research source Don’t put pressure on yourself if a Kundalini awakening doesn’t happen right away—some people practice for years before experiencing it. Also, be gentle with yourself as you navigate the symptoms of a Kundalini awakening. The experience is harder on some people than others—try to embrace the changes and learn what you can from them, even the more challenging parts."

      "content": "Try grounding exercises to feel more centered. Samuels says, “Ground yourself every day. Being in nature helps you ground yourself. Focus on your breath and your body. Take time to process your emotions and your energy—learn to enjoy your own company. And when you can, avoid crowds, bright lights, loud noises, and small talk.” Samuels recommends the following grounding exercise : “Imagine that your energy is connected to the earth. Then, imagine you have a waterfall washing over you, cleansing away any energy that you picked up through the day that doesn’t belong to you or serve you.” Another exercise that Samuels recommends is to “Put one hand on your solar plexus and the other hand facing the other way. Push that other hand away and say, ‘What’s mine is mine. Anything that doesn’t belong to me, I return to its source cleansed and purified. I let go of any energy or emotion that doesn’t belong to me.’ Then, imagine a bright light cleansing you from within."

      "content": "Practice self-care. Self-care is always important, but if you’re undergoing a Kundalini awakening, it’s essential to do things that make you feel relaxed and nourished. Exercise, journaling, meditation, and spending time in nature are all good options—find what works best for you. If you feel relaxed by a certain scent, light candles as you meditate or bathe. Spend time with people you love to rejuvenate your spirit. Prioritize sleep and rest. A Kundalini awakening can be an intense experience, and being well-rested can make it easier to cope with the symptoms.

      "title": "A Kundalini awakening involves the release of dormant energy.",
      "content": "A Kundalini awakening involves the release of dormant energy. Kundalini energy is thought to be coiled snake-like at the base of the spine near the Root chakra (or Muladhara chakra). A Kundalini awakening involves releasing this energy to tap into its powers, moving it from the spine to the head (or Crown chakra). [22] X Research source Some people find a Kundalini awakening to be an empowering experience, helping them unlock creativity, compassion, and a connection with the universe. Other people have a less pleasant awakening, sometimes experiencing physical pain or discomfort, overwhelming emotions, psychological distress, or a disconnection from their sense of self. It’s important to note that a Kundalini awakening is an extremely personal experience. The signs and symptoms will be different for everyone—there are some common occurrences, but there’s no universal Kundalini experience."

      "content": "Kundalini awakening can be spontaneous or deliberate. Practitioners of yoga and meditation can sometimes awaken their Kundalini through deliberate exercises where they open themselves to Kundalini’s energy and wisdom. Energy healing and reiki practices sometimes trigger Kundalini as well. [23] X Research source In other cases, Kundalini is awakened spontaneously—usually during or after an intense experience like childbirth, puberty, menopause, trauma, grief, depression, or substance abuse."

      "title": "It's not inherently dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable.",
      "content": "It's not inherently dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable. A Kundalini awakening can make some people feel isolated or alienated. You might feel that you’re only a small part in the universe so everything you do is pointless, or like there’s no point working and paying bills because all you want to do is meditate. [24] X Research source By staying grounded and working with a mentor or supportive community, you can help sidestep these pitfalls. If Kundalini energy starts to get too overwhelming, take a break from your meditation practice. Focus on grounding activities or spend more time in nature during the break to help you feel more connected to the world around you."

      "title": "Kundalini can be a disruptive but transformative experience.",
      "content": "Kundalini can be a disruptive but transformative experience. Some of the symptoms can be uncomfortable, but they’re there to serve a purpose—even if that purpose can be hard to see. For instance, physical symptoms like pain and tremors may occur because the Kundalini is moving blocked energy due to repressed trauma. Ultimately, this will serve you, even if it is difficult in the moment. Working with an experienced spiritual leader can help you find the meaning in difficult Kundalini symptoms, as well as having support as you navigate them."
