      "content": "Make a great first impression with a nice headshot. Your primary photo is the first photo potential matches see, so pick a photo that represents you accurately and shows off the good looks your mama gave you! Opt for a recent, straightforward headshot, but make sure it's well-lit and flattering . For your primary photo, don’t use filters or wear sunglasses, hats, or anything that may obscure your appearance. Add some personality by taking your photo in front of an interesting background, such as your garden or your bookshelf, or hold your pet in your arms to show you’re an animal-lover. Just make sure your face is clearly visible. [1] X Research source Secondary photos may depict you with friends to highlight your sociability, but make sure your first photo is just of you. If your first pic is of multiple people, a potential match might not be sure who you are. Be sure to use a high-resolution photo so that potential matches get a clear idea of what you look like. Just don’t go for too polished, and don’t photoshop. Putting too much effort into your photos may make you appear vain. Avoid professional and job photographs, since they tend to be too strict and stiff."

      "title": "Tell the \"story\" of you with your images.",
      "content": "Tell the \"story\" of you with your images. Good answers to prompts are vital to the success of your profile, but a picture is worth a thousand words. Choose pics that show off your personality and activities you enjoy, as well as photos that might get a conversation going. Make sure all of your photos include you. Don't waste precious profile space on a photo of your pet lizard, unless you're in the photo with him. [2] X Research source Be sure your photos accurately reflect who you are. If your pal begged you to go hiking once even though you’re not very outdoorsy, don’t post a photo of you on the trails. [3] X Research source Avoid photos including exes, even if you are on good terms with your exes. This may give the impression you are still involved with someone, or not over a past relationship. [4] X Research source If you’re looking for a committed relationship, don’t post more than one overly “sexy” or revealing photo, as this may give potential matches the idea you’re not looking for anything serious. [5] X Research source Pics of you at bars or with a drink aren’t a no-go, but photos depicting hardcore partying may be a turn-off for some people. Leave your second-best picture to last, so you're starting and ending strong."

      "title": "Tell the truth about your height, age, education, and any other facts.",
      "content": "Tell the truth about your height, age, education, and any other facts. You may think exaggerating the truth will attract more matches, but it’s unlikely you’ll be able to keep up the ruse if you meet someone in real life. (Anyway, your perfect match will like you for who you are!) [6] X Research source It's always better to lead with honesty, and really show all the other awesome and amazing characteristics that you bring to the table. Humor is essential to a good profile, but this isn’t the place for it. Saying you got your college degree from “the school of hard knocks” is groan-worthy, to say the least. [7] X Research source Make sure that you're looking after your health, that you dress well, that you're really cultivating awareness of yourself. Having a good personality and good conversation skills is more important than being taller or younger. Show your best and honest side."

      "title": "Prompts that highlight your dislikes will turn people off.",
      "content": "Prompts that highlight your dislikes will turn people off. Matches are more likely to respond to profiles that look on the bright side, so avoid discussing what you don’t want in a relationship or alluding to past relationships, which may make you seem bitter. [8] X Research source Get creative and specific. “The highlight of my day is spending time with my family” is positive, but you only have so few characters with which to present yourself: don’t waste them on a common sentiment. [9] X Research source Remember that positivity doesn't equal sappiness. (In other words, nix the Jim and Pam references!) “The highlight of my day is usually…my morning jog, followed by that first sip of coffee and the funnies (yes, I still read a physical paper!).” “Typical Sunday: sleeping in, then working on my novel at the local bistro.” “I take pride in…my garden.”"

      "title": "Include conversation-starters to give your match something to talk about.",
      "content": "Include conversation-starters to give your match something to talk about. Adding a bit of excitement, spice, or mystery to your answers will make potential matches eager to hear more. Go for short and sweet, and be a little cryptic—but avoid one-word answers, as this could suggest to potential matches you aren’t really invested. [10] X Research source Hint: it can be hard to promote yourself or know what makes you stand out. If you’re not sure what to say about yourself, ask your friends what they would say about you: what makes you interesting? How do they describe you to other people? [11] X Research source “A fact about me that surprises people: I've seen Pee-wee's Big Adventure 18 times.” “ Two truths and a lie : I've never been to Starbucks. I won an award for Best Haircut in the second grade. I once met Dolly Parton.” “Worst roommate story: Bees. Just...bees. ”"

      "content": "Pick prompts that show you know how to joke around . Reply in a funny, humorously self-deprecating, or sarcastic way—but avoid humor that’s mean or too biting. [12] X Research source Be sure not to copy jokes or memes from the internet or TV. The goal isn't just to be funny, it's to be original. For best results, curate a profile that is a mix of lighthearted or sarcastic and sincere. Showcase your fun side, but be sure to highlight your substance too. [13] X Research source “I'm convinced that...horses are aliens.\" “Worst fad I participated in: Hey, I looked cute with those emo bangs!” “My most irrational fear: that my dog secretly hates me.”"

      "content": "The only thing hotter than a sense of humor is vulnerability. You don’t have to share your life story, but don’t be shy about who you are . Pick prompts that will let you highlight your goals and values. [14] X Research source That said, keep it concise and down-to-earth. Not only does a bit of mystery entice potential matches, but oversharing can be a major turn-off. [15] X Research source “Most spontaneous thing I’ve ever done: quit my job to move across the country.” “Let's make sure we're on the same page about…our politics.\" “The secret to getting to know me is...talking to my siblings.\""

      "content": "Show what matters to you to find a match with similar vibes. Pick prompts that give you an opportunity to be specific about your hobbies and interests, but don’t be too niche, or you risk alienating your potential matches. If you have esoteric hobbies or interests, present those after mentioning your more relatable interests. [16] X Research source “ My simple pleasures : My cat's paws. Going to Sephora to smell all the perfumes. A good thunderstorm.” “I geek out on…LaCroix, board games, and Elvis.” “I’m a regular at…the 24-hour diner near me. Not even my mom makes pancakes that good.”"

      "content": "What do you look for in a partner? What sort of activities do you envision doing with your date? Cooking? Hiking? Lying around watching Seinfeld ? Pick a prompt or two that will give your potential match an idea of what dating you might look like, and what you’re after in a relationship . [17] X Research source “We’re the same type of weird if…you listen to Christmas music regardless of the season.” “All I ask is that you…be honest, true to yourself, and communicative.” “ Green flags I look for : positive energy, good tipper, kind to animals, and loves to eat!!”"

      "content": "Suggestive or mean comments are major turnoffs. Not only will replying to prompts (or private messages, for that matter!) with dirty jokes or unkind comments give the impression you aren’t looking for a real connection, it will offend people. Your first impression gives other Hinge users an idea of what it would be like to date you, so make sure you're coming off fun, respectful, and not like a giant bucket of red flags. [18] X Research source Avoid poking fun at the dating app. Show you’re taking the process seriously—otherwise, why should your potential match take you seriously? [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Think through what you're not willing to accept in a partner.",
      "content": "Think through what you're not willing to accept in a partner. Life is short, so question your expectations and experiment with your comfort zone. There’s a difference between not wanting to be in a long-distance relationship and not wanting to date someone because they're over or under a certain height or weight: one of these will have logistical effects on your relationship, while the other is a preference that is likely outweighed by quality of character. [20] X Research source This being said, don't compromise your needs for the sake of a larger dating pool. If you know you don't want to get involved with someone who doesn't want children or who holds different political beliefs, make sure your preferences reflect that. Your profile, including your preferences, isn’t permanent. You can always edit your settings to reflect different preferences whenever you want."
