      "content": "A line-up is when you cut the hairline and hair edges into a straight line. A line-up (also known as a shape-up or edge-up) is a type of haircut that involves cutting the edges of the hair, the hairline, and sideburns to keep them straight. They’re usually cut using short-guarded clippers or a straight razor. When people talk about line-ups, they’re usually referring to the cutting of the hairline into a straight line, but it also refers to any of the other previously mentioned areas. [1] X Research source An all-around line-up is a lineup that encompasses the hairline, edges, sideburns, and back of the head, not just the hairline. A fresh line-up is a line-up haircut that’s just been cut. For example, say your buddy just came out of the barbershop and got a line-up and a taper fade. When you see them, you’d say something like “Okay, bro, I see you with the fresh line-up.”"

      "content": "A line-up cleans up the hairline and edges; a haircut changes the style. A line-up is typically less work than regular haircuts, as it involves cutting the hairline, sideburns, and edges into straight, crisp lines. On the other hand, a regular haircut involves cutting the sides and top of the hair into a new style or shape, which typically requires more effort by barbers. Since a line-up is less work, barbers usually charge less for them."

      "title": "Caesar Cut",
      "content": "Caesar Cut The Caesar cut is one of the best hairstyles for a line-up. It’s a short hairstyle that cuts the hair to a length that’s just above the top of the head, making for a smooth, circular-shaped look. The only problem with the Caesar cut is the bangs, as they take away from the crispy look on top of the head. The solution? A line-up, of course, as it straightens the bangs and brings that crispy look to the rest of the head. It’s best to visit the barber every two weeks to get your lineup and Caesar cut cleaned up, as it starts to look more disheveled as the hair grows back."

      "title": "High-Top Fade",
      "content": "High-Top Fade The fade is a classic haircut that was paired with a high-top in the 1980s and 90s. The cut features a tall square of hair that fades into a short length as it approaches the lower sides of the hair. When paired with a line-up, the high-top fade becomes even more crispy, matching well with the fade on the sides. So for a crispy look, ask your barber for a high-top fade with a line-up.

      "title": "Pompadour",
      "content": "Pompadour Like an undercut, the pompadour contrasts short hair on the sides and long hair on top. The difference between the two is that the sides aren’t cut as short on pompadour haircuts and the top is styled upward for a voluminous look. When paired with a lineup, the tall top is accentuated, with the straight hairline and edges helping form a clear defining line and make a clean look."

For a more relaxed look that’s still sharp, sport a large afro with a line-up on the hairline and edges. To elevate the look even more, consider adding a fade ."

The faux hawk is a modern hairstyle that features longer, slightly spiky hair up top and a fade on the sides.

For a stronger contrast, wear your curls high and get a line-up all around. For a more casual, subdued look, get a line-up on the edges and keep the curls relatively short."

When you sit down in the chair, simply ask your barber to line-up your hairline and avoid touching any of the other edges of your hair.

If you ask for a lining, they’ll typically assume that you mean all around (hairline, edges, and all), but to be safe, specify that you want it all-around. If there are any areas you want them to avoid, specify that before they put the clippers to your head."

      "content": "Tip 15-25+ percent depending on the quality of the line-up. Although tipping isn’t mandatory, it is a big factor in the barber’s check at the end of the week, so it’s really useful for them! When it comes to tipping for a lineup, it's standard to tip 20 percent. But depending on whether you're trying out a new barber, the cut is mid, or they completely blow your expectations out of the water, that percent varies. The tipping standard for different quality line-ups is as follows: [5] X Research source For an average line-up, tip 15-20 percent. For a great line-up that you're happy with, tip 20-25 percent. For a line-up that completely exceeds your expectations, tip 25 percent or more. For a $40 haircut, the general rule of thumb is $6 for an average or below average cut (15%), $8 for a good or great cut (20%), and $10 or more (25%+) for a cut that’s excellent."

Although the afro had been a symbol of Black pride in the 1960s and 70s, the 80s ushered in more versatile haircuts to take its place, with the line-up being one of them. Towards the end of the 80s, hip-hop artists like Big Daddy Kane and Rakim popularized the cut. By the 1990s, the line-up became common in barbershops across America. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Can you give yourself a line-up? Yes, you can give yourself a line-up at home. By using a mirror and a straight razor, low-guard clippers, or liners, you can give yourself a line-up at home. Make reference points on your hairline for where to cut your hair so that it’s a straight line rather than trying to draw a straight line freehand, then get to cutting. As you cut the edges, let your clippers do the cutting before moving them downward. That way, they’ll be straighter. [7] X Research source If you have a front taper, brush your hair down and use clippers with the 1-guard open to cut down on the front taper and bring your hair down before giving yourself a line-up. Hair stylist Yan Kandkhorov says that having your head positioned too down or too high up is a common mistake when cutting your hair straight. According to Kandkhorov, \"there has to be a certain position of the head that creates that evenness.\"[v161225_b01]. 28 Jan 2020."

      "content": "What is a line-up for beards? A beard line-up is when the beard is cut with a sharp razor to define the shape. Like a regular line-up, a beard line-up involves using a sharp blade to cut along the natural curves of your hairline (in this case, your beardline). A beard-line up is done to sharpen the edges of your beard and give it a more clean, groomed look. If you regularly line up your beard and take care of it , it will look clean and sharp, as opposed to someone who doesn’t get it lined up."
