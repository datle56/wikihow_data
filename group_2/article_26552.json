I don’t often stop to think about luck, but when I do, it’s usually because I’m reminded of how much better my world is with you in it. Not because you fix everything, but because you stand with me through it. With you, I’ve learned that love isn’t about filling voids but about complementing what’s already there. You don’t complete me—you add to what was already whole, and I’ve come to love that about us. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

I know you are not with me right now and are working towards a better life for us. But not even a single second passes by without missing you. All I want is to be with you and hold you close to my heart for the rest of my life. Every time I close my eyes, I can feel your touch and hear your voice as if you are near me.

I dearly miss you and I wish the words could show you how much. Please come back soon, so that I can hug you tightly again. I genuinely miss you. While I see you daily, I’m always with you, but I miss you. And how could you ever miss someone when they’re in your thoughts, your dreams, and your fantasies, when you think about it? I fall asleep with your love messages and images alongside me every night until you return home to keep me warm to say you’re home. Every time I see you, you will never know what you do to me, yet it kills me that we can’t be together right now. No matter—I always have love for you in my heart, and know that you complete my existence."
