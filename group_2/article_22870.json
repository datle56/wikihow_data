      "content": "Make sure your internet service contract allows hosting. Many internet service providers (ISPs) expressly forbid personal hosting unless you have a business plan, which often costs significantly more than a standard use plan. This shouldn't be an issue if your site only generates a few hits per month, but any kind of significant traffic will draw attention to your hosting. If your ISP prohibits home hosting, either upgrade your plan to one that allows hosting or switch to a different ISP before you continue. Failing to heed your ISP's policy for home hosting can result in anything from getting your internet turned off to having to pay fines."
