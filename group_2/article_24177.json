      "content": "Attach the switch with screws or adhesive. The switches for most models of doorbells come with holes at the back to make installation easy. Measure the switch and holes and use an electric drill to mount the switch on your door or wall. Alternatively, apply a strong binding glue to the back of the switch and apply it firmly to the desired surface.

      "content": "Choose a central spot to install the chime box. Ideally, the chime box should be mounted somewhere at the center of your home to ensure that everyone hears it. Pick a room that is relatively equal in distance from all the other rooms in your home. Choose a room that you do not usually close the doors to make sure that the sound will carry. For instance, you might install the chime box in your living room or dining room. Check the range on the chime box to make sure it still connects to the doorbell.

      "content": "Cut off power from the breaker or fuse box to avoid injury. Make sure that the circuits that supply electricity to the power sources you are working with are shut off before starting the installation. Turn off the appropriate switches at your breaker panel or fuse box. Test light switches or other outlets in the area to make sure the power is off."

Wrap the ends of the wires around the appropriate terminals. Screw the holding screws into position. [5] X Research source You can choose from a variety of door chimes with different dimensions and sound options. Many models of chimes will include small wiring diagrams printed inside to help with installation. The cover should pull off the chimes easily without the use of tools. For future reference, label the wires by writing where each one is meant to go (e.g. transformer, doorbell switch) on small pieces of masking tape attached to each one."

      "content": "Attach the wires so that the transformer is connected to both the chime and the doorbell. Carefully wrap the ends of the wires around the transformer terminals. This small metal device will convert the AC power coming from the door switch to a lower voltage power to power the chimes.Transformers are often mounted directly onto an electrical box to keep high voltage wires enclosed.

      "content": "Attach the switch and chimes with twist wire connectors. Use plastic twist wire connectors to easily link wires between the switch and chimes. Bring the ends of both wires together and place the cap onto the ends, twisting until the wires are firmly connected. This direct connection will create the signal between the doorbell button and the chimes, while the transformer will mediate this connection to bring it to a safe voltage. [7] X Research source"
