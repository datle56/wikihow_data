Since “toned” is a vague term, decide what it means to you: is it a particular “look”? Is it the way your clothing fits? Establish a timeline for yourself for each of your goals that are reasonable, considering your current fitness level and the time you have available to work out. Include smaller goals along the way to your more ambitious ones, and reward yourself as you accomplish these aims. Plan to reward yourself once you've reached your primary goals. You might consider a special shopping trip for new clothes that fit - and show off - your new toned figure. [13] X Research source"

Wear a watch to measure your pulse rate before and after walking 1 mile and to track how long it took you to walk one mile or run 1.5 miles. Count the number of standard or modified push ups and the number of half sit-ups you can complete at one time.

The variety of workout videos available seems endless, as you have options for workouts that are everything from high-intensity plyometrics to dance-based muscle-toning. Consider your goals, time, fitness level, and general health: do you want to lose weight quickly? Are you physically able to complete the movements required? Does the exercise routine look like an enjoyable, yet challenging, activity? Some videos are part of an exercise series that operate as a unit, such as P90x. These are useful because the day-to-day variation can keep boredom at bay and can keep the level of challenge high. Moderate intensity and vigorous intensity can usually be determined by the “talk test”: If you can only say a few words before taking a breath, the activity is of vigorous intensity. If you can talk, but not sing, then you're working out at a moderate intensity. [18] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You will notice that, as you become fitter, activities that began as vigorous-intensity might become moderate-intensity.

Read the information provided on the DVD case, web site, or video comments to determine the equipment you'll need to acquire. Even if your video doesn't call for extra materials, consider investing in some basics, like free weights, resistance tubing, and a jump rope. These items can be useful on those days you only have a moment or two, but you want to squeeze in a quick workout. In some cases you can improvise using materials you already have at home, such as soup cans for hand weights and a chair for a workout bench."

If you've teamed up with a friend, send them a message or give them a call to make sure they're on the way. Have an extra towel and water bottle ready, just in case your buddy forgot his or hers.

In order to meet your fitness goals, you should evaluate the time that you have to spend on an outside activity, whether you can leave home for a period of time if you have children, and your physical ability to engage in the activity. Additionally, consider the location of your home, availability of sidewalks, traffic patterns, and neighborhood safety when choosing an activity. Running, or jogging, is a vigorous-intensity cardiovascular exercise that also tones your legs and core. Be aware that recent studies have shown that jogging slowly is preferable to fast running, in terms of cardiovascular health. [19] X Research source Walking is a moderate-intensity activity that offers some of the same results as running, though at a slower pace overall. Cycling: Cycling can improve your balance and shoulder strength, as well as your core, leg, and gluteus muscles. Standing up in the saddle when cycling can be tiring, but it helps to tone your legs quicker, as it is a much more vigorous exercise."

You should also purchase, or borrow, a watch with a timer, especially if you're interested in attaining a particular speed or pace as part of your fitness goals. Consider purchasing safety equipment appropriate to your activity, such as headlamps, flashing lights, and reflective clothing. You can also purchase running and walking shoes from a dedicated running shoe store. In these shops, they will measure your foot, watch your running or walking motion and positioning, evaluate your toe and heel striking.

Often, setting a deadline for yourself will encourage you to work out when you're feeling tired or busy, and the sense of competition will push you to challenge yourself to work harder. The more consistently you work out, the more quickly you'll see results. Consider announcing your event on social media, so that your friends and family can cheer you on and then laud your accompaniment.

You can challenge each other to go faster or work harder, and you can offer support as you become tired. If you're walking with a friend, use the “talk test” to make sure that you keep a pace that is a workout, rather than just a leisurely stroll.

You might purchase a treadmill, if you are a runner or a walker, or a recumbent bike if you prefer cycling. On the other hand, you might consider another variety of workout, such as yoga or pilates, to add greater flexibility and, thus, improved performance when you can go back outside. It's wise to take a day off upon occasion, in order to allow your muscles time to recover. Spending several minutes using a jump-rope is a great cardiovascular workout, and can be a good lower-body workout, too."
