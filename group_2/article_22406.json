      "content": "Get her a training bra as soon as her breasts start to develop. One of the most noticeable changes that may occur to girls during puberty is the growth of breast tissue. Explain to your child that this is normal, and that is happens differently for every girl. Take her shopping for a training bra when this development starts, to help her feel comfortable about her changing body. She will feel very happy about this. This change may start as young as eight in some girls. If your daughter requests a training bra before she starts to develop, buy her one anyway to encourage her to make active choices about her body and to ensure she feels more comfortable."

Help her decide whether she wants to do so in the morning or in the evening before bed. A child who plays sports may need to wash more than once a day to maintain good hygiene."
