      "title": "Chop the ginger and apple.",
      "content": "Chop the ginger and apple. Rinse a large piece of ginger root and 1 sweet apple, such as Honeycrisp, Gala, or Golden Delicious. Cut the apple into 4 equal pieces and place them in a blender. Then chop the ginger into rough pieces that are about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) in size. Once you have 3 cups (150 g) of chopped ginger, put it in the blender with the apple pieces. [1] X Research source Since you'll be straining the mixture, there's no need to peel the apple or ginger. You also don't need to core the apple. If you have a juicer, you can use it instead of the blender."

    {
      "title": "Peel and cut 3 to 4 lemons.",
      "content": "Peel and cut 3 to 4 lemons. Rinse the lemons and use a vegetable peeler to remove the tough rind. Then chop the lemons in half and add them to the blender. [2] X Research source Discard the lemon rind or use it in other recipes."

    {
      "title": "Add turmeric root and black pepper to the blender.",
      "content": "Add turmeric root and black pepper to the blender. Rinse 4 cups (200 g) of turmeric root and roughly chop them before putting them into the blender along with 1 pinch of ground black pepper. If you prefer an even spicier shot, add a pinch of ground cayenne pepper or cinnamon as well. [3] X Research source There's no need to peel the turmeric since you'll be straining the liquid and the roots are too small to peel easily."

      "title": "Blend the ingredients until they're smooth.",
      "content": "Blend the ingredients until they're smooth. Put the lid on the blender and pulse the ingredients until the roots, apple, and lemons are combined. Continue to pulse the mixture until it's thick and smooth. [4] X Research source You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the blender occasionally."

      "title": "Strain the ginger and turmeric mixture.",
      "content": "Strain the ginger and turmeric mixture. Set a fine mesh strainer over a clean bowl and pour the mixture into it. Use the back of a spoon to press the liquid through the strainer so the solids remain. [5] X Research source For even smoother shots, line the strainer with a piece of cheesecloth."

      "title": "Drink and store the ginger turmeric shots.",
      "content": "Drink and store the ginger turmeric shots. Transfer the liquid in the bowl to a storage container. Then pour some of it into a small shot glass and drink it, followed by a glass of water. Refrigerate the remaining liquid for up to 4 days. [6] X Research source You can drink as many ginger and turmeric shots a day as you like. For longer storage, pour the liquid into a clean ice cube tray. Then defrost a cube whenever you'd like a shot. Freeze the shots for up to 6 months."

You should end up with 1/4 cup (15 g) of chopped ginger root. Place the ginger chunks into a blender. [7] X Research source"

Use a citrus reamer or juicer to squeeze the lemons until you get 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of juice. Then pour the juice into the blender with the ginger.

Store the remaining liquid in an airtight storage container and refrigerate it for up to 1 week. [11] X Research source Keep in mind that the liquid will intensify in flavor the longer it's stored.
