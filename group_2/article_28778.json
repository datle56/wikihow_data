      "title": "Cut a 2 in (5.1 cm) section out of the end of a 3 ft (0.91 m) PVC pipe.",
      "content": "Cut a 2 in (5.1 cm) section out of the end of a 3 ft (0.91 m) PVC pipe. Measure from the end of the pipe and make a mark on it about 2 in (5.1 cm) in. Then, use a hand saw or power saw to cut about halfway through the pipe at this point. After that, make 2 more cuts going inwards from the end of the pipe. This will remove a 2 in (5.1 cm) wide square section from the end of the pipe. [1] X Research source Do not cut out any other sections out of the pipe! Do not cut all the way through the pipe. Only cut halfway through it on 1 end."

      "title": "Glue the back of the pipe to the inside of a shallow bucket.",
      "content": "Glue the back of the pipe to the inside of a shallow bucket. Apply a generous amount of liquid cement or another strong adhesive to the uncut, back side of the pipe. Then, insert the end of the pipe into the bucket. Press the adhesive side against the inside of the bucket. Hold it in this position for about 1 minute to let the adhesive bond. [2] X Research source Use a bucket that is around 6 in (15 cm) in height. This will ensure that the chickens can reach the food with ease."

      "title": "Lay the feeder on its side and allow the glue to dry overnight.",
      "content": "Lay the feeder on its side and allow the glue to dry overnight. Lay the pipe and bucket on the ground. Keep the pipe in the position you glued it in. Make sure it presses against the inside of bucket as it dries. It may only take about 15 minutes for the liquid cement to dry fully, but leave it for at least 1 hour to be sure. [3] X Research source Liquid cement starts to dry quickly, so press the bucket and pipe together right away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour food into the top of the pipe and allow the chickens to feed freely.",
      "content": "Pour food into the top of the pipe and allow the chickens to feed freely. After the pipe has dried completely, pour chicken feed into the tube to fill it. Hold the pipe upright as you fill it. The feed will spill out into the bucket and this will keep the feeder erect after it is full. [4] X Research source Donâ€™t worry about the bucket overflowing. The feeder will only allow food to come out as high as the section you cut in the pipe, so there should be no more than 2 in (5.1 cm) of feed in the bucket at all times. You may want to tie the filled feeder to a post to help keep it steady. It will stand upright on its own, but it may still tip over if it gets bumped."

      "content": "Cut 4 holes in the center of a 1.5 ft (0.46 m) PVC plastic pipe. Choose a PVC pipe that is about 4 in (10 cm) in diameter. Use a drill with a hole cutting bit to cut 2 in (5.1 cm) diameter holes in 1 side of the pipe. [5] X Research source If you do not have a drill with a hole cutting bit, use a hand saw or power saw to cut a 6 in (15 cm) section out of the center of the pipe. Do not cut all the way through the pipe. Only cut a 6 in (15 cm) section that goes halfway through the pipe."

      "content": "Attach an elbow pipe piece and a 3 ft (0.91 m) PVC pipe. Place an elbow piece on 1 end of the 1.5 ft (0.46 m) pipe. Then, connect the 3 ft (0.91 m) PVC pipe to the other end of the elbow. Adjust the elbow and pipes so that they form a right angle. [6] X Research source Make sure that the holes or section you cut out of the pipe are facing upwards."

      "content": "Place a cap on the open end of the shorter PVC pipe. To prevent chicken feed from spilling out, place an end cap onto the other end of the 1.5 ft (0.46 m) pipe. If the lid does not fit tightly, apply liquid cement or another strong adhesive to the inside of the cap to help it stay in place. [7] X Research source Make sure that you let the adhesive on the end cap dry completely before using the feeder. This should only take about 15 to 30 minutes, but wait at least 1 hour to ensure that they are dry. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour food into the opening of the vertical pipe to feed your chickens. Position the feeder so that the upright tube is in a corner to stabilize it. Then, with the open end of the 3 ft (0.91 m) pipe pointing up, pour chicken feed into the feeder. Keep filling until the feed reaches the top of the 3 ft (0.91 m) pipe. Then, place an end cap on the pipe to protect the food from moisture. [9] X Research source Do not glue this end cap in place since you will need to remove it each time you feed your chickens."
