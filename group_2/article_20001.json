      "content": "Scrape any excess Vaseline off the fabric with a dull edge. It’s important to remove as much Vaseline as possible from the get-go to prevent excess oil from setting into the fabric. [1] X Research source Simply use a butter knife, spoon, or something similar to scrape it away. Go slowly, being careful not to spread the Vaseline any further. Do not try to rub away the Vaseline, as rubbing can spread it deeper into your garment and make it harder to get out."

      "title": "Rub the fabric with dishwashing soap.",
      "content": "Rub the fabric with dishwashing soap. House cleaning professional Raymond Chiu says to pour a small amount of dish soap (like Dawn) onto the stain and rub it into the fabric with your fingers. Just put both hands on the inside and outside of the fabric and rub them together to make sure the soap goes through the fabric and reaches the entire surface of the stain. [2] X Research source Alternatively, professional dry cleaner Safir Ali recommends that you “add a couple drops of [dish soap] into warm water” and “let it soak into the stain” for 5 minutes to remove oil and grease. Then, “rub the stain against itself gently” to get out the residue. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to really get the soap into the fibers. Just avoid using a brush on thin fabrics (like pima cotton), as it can tear or stretch the fibers. Dish soap is great at removing fresh and set-in Vaseline stains because it is a degreaser that breaks down oily and greasy residue, like petroleum jelly."

      "content": "Rinse the soap away from the stained area with warm or hot water. Run warm or hot water over the stained area to get all the soap (and hopefully the oil from the Vaseline) out. Then, check to see if the stain is lifted a little and if the fabric feels less oily. [3] X Research source Note : You may need to rub your garment with dish soap a few more times to lift the stain if a lot of Vaseline got into the fabric or if the Vaseline has been there for a while.

Just make sure to follow the particular stain remover’s instructions to prevent any discoloration (especially if the formula contains bleach). [5] X Research source If you don’t have any stain remover, soak the spot with liquid laundry detergent or rub a wet bar of regular soap into the stain. [6] X Research source"

Then, throw your item in the laundry machine with a bit of detergent and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar to wash away any leftover Vaseline. [7] X Research source Feel free to wash the garment by hand in the sink, if you prefer. Hot water lifts stains and oil from clothing fibers better than colder water. Note : Always check the care label to see what water temperature is safe for the fabric. If hot water isn’t recommended, use warm water—it doesn’t cause shrinkage like hot water can."

So, take your garment out of the laundry machine and inspect the stained spot before drying it. [8] X Research source If the Vaseline is all gone , place the garment in your dryer or hang it up to air dry. If the Vaseline stain is still there , rub the spot with more dish soap. Then, rinse out the soap, apply more stain remover, and wash the item again. If the stain still isn’t coming out, try one of the other stain removal methods below!"

Then, wet a clean dry cloth or cotton pad with alcohol and press it into the stain. Just keep lightly dabbing the spot with the alcohol to ensure the stain is soaked through. [9] X Research source Rubbing alcohol and isopropyl alcohol are degreasing agents that dissolve oily residues like petroleum jelly. Chiu says to spot-test the rubbing or isopropyl alcohol on an inconspicuous part of the garment to check if it discolors or damages the fabric. If it does, do not use this stain removal method on your garment. Avoid using rubbing and isopropyl alcohol on synthetic fabrics, like acetate, triacetate, modacrylic, and acrylic, or delicate fabrics, like silk, as it can damage and dissolve the fibers.

Then, laundry and cleaning specialist Rani Gorgis says to mix 1 part vinegar with 2 parts water in a spray bottle and “spray it directly on the stain.” Just leave the vinegar to soak into the Vaseline for 5 to 10 minutes. Vinegar is a natural astringent that packs a powerful punch against oil and grease stains. If you’re treating a colored garment , soak it in equal parts vinegar and water to protect the fabric from fading or discoloration. Note : Spot test the vinegar on a hidden part of your garment to ensure it doesn’t stain or damage the fabric. Don’t worry—your garment won’t smell like vinegar once you wash and dry it."

To remove the dye, soak your clothes in an oxygen bleach mixture after removing the excess Vaseline but before you launder the item. [25] X Research source Mix 2 tablespoons of bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Submerge the garment in the mixture. Let the garment soak for 1 hour for fresh stains, or overnight for tough, set-in stains. Wash the garment in your laundry machine. Note : Spot test the oxygen bleach mixture on an inconspicuous spot of your garment. While oxygen bleach is generally safe to use on colored fabrics, it may discolor some items."

If none of the above DIY methods get the Vaseline out of your clothes, bring your garment to a professional dry cleaner. If the care tag on your garment says “Dry clean only,” bring it to a professional at the get-go to remove the stain. For instance, bring delicate fabrics like leather, silk, satin, velvet, and suede to a professional dry cleaner to remove the stain. These fabrics can be more susceptible to damage from DIY stain removal methods. Dry cleaners use special cleaning products that can get rid of stubborn stains."
