      "content": "Hot glue the wick to the bottom of an empty 4-ounce (120-milliliter) jar. Get a wick that already has a metal tab attached to it, and place a glob of hot glue on the bottom of the tab. Quickly press the tab against the bottom of the jar. You can also use a candle votive. It needs to hold about 4 ounces (120 milliliters). If you don't have a hot glue gun, you can use a piece of double-sided tape instead. You can also try to balance the candle wick as best you can. For a fun twist, cut a small, sugar pumpkin in half, and scoop out all of the seeds and pulp. You make need to double the amounts for the wax and spices in order to fill the candle.

      "content": "Melt the wax. Put the wax into a glass measuring cup, then set the cup down in a large pot. Fill the pot with water until it is level with the wax; make sure that the water can't get inside the measuring cup. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, and wait for the wax to melt, stirring it occasionally. [2] X Research source Use an old measuring cup that you no longer use for cooking. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can melt the wax in the microwave at 1 to 2-minute intervals. Stir the wax between each interval. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the measuring cup with the wax out of the water, and stir 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon into the wax using a wooden skewer. For a more intense fragrance, add 15 drops of cinnamon essential oil. [5] X Research source If you'd like a more complex fragrance, consider adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and ½ teaspoon of ground clove. [6] X Research source Use pot holders to handle the measuring cup. It will be very hot."

      "content": "Get a short, unscented pillar candle. The candle can be any size you want, but keep in mind that you will be wrapping the cinnamon sticks around this candle. The thicker the candle is, the more cinnamon sticks you will have to use. Choose a candle that is the same height as your cinnamon sticks. You can also use a tea candle, and stick it in a glass candle votive instead. For a twist, try a vanilla-scented candle. The cinnamon fragrance will blend well with it."

      "content": "Straighten the cinnamon sticks up. It's okay if the cinnamon sticks are different heights or extend past the top of the candle, but they all need to be flat on the bottom. Gently tap your candle against a flat surface, such as a table, and push down on the cinnamon sticks until they are all even on the bottom. This will make your candle more stable, and prevent it from wobbling. [9] X Research source All cinnamon sticks have a groove or seam. You can have the sticks all facing in the same direction, so that the groove is facing inward or outward. You can also make it random, with some of the sticks facing inward, and others facing outward. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the rubber band by wrapping some ribbon around it. For a more rustic feel, you can use burlap ribbon instead. You can also wrap some baker's twine or jute string around it, then tie the ends into a bow; you'll have to wrap the twine/string a few times in order to cover the rubber band. [11] X Research source You can use any type of ribbon you want, but something warm colored (burgundy, copper, or brown) will look best. You can also use fabric, gingham ribbon for that rustic, country feel. Grosgrain ribbon will also look great. If you are using baker's twine, consider using the red-and-white or red-and-ivory kind. It will make your candle look more interesting."

      "content": "Consider adding some embellishments for that final touch. These types of candles already look pretty rustic, so anything that is related to fall, winter, or cozy, country cottages is a safe bet. Small pieces of branches, especially those with red berries attached, are a great choice. These branches and berries don't have to be real; craft stores sell realistic-looking plastic ones that last many years. If this is for winter, consider something with holly leaves and red berries. You can also use a mini branch with fake \"ice crystals\" attached. If this is for fall, consider something simple, such as a bare branch, or a branch with red berries. If you used a fabric, gingham ribbon, get a plastic button in a matching color, and glue it over the top of the bow."

      "title": "Use the candle.",
      "content": "Use the candle. Simply set the candle on a heat-safe surface, and light it. The heat from the fire will cause the cinnamon sticks to warm up, and release their fragrance. If you made a cinnamon-wrapped candle votive instead, you must use real candles; those battery-operated candles do not give off enough heat."
