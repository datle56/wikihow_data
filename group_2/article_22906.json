      "content": "A housewarming gift isn’t required, but it is good etiquette. Whether you’re welcoming a new neighbor or helping a family member settle into their new place, giving them a housewarming gift is a great way to show you care. Housewarming gifts are typically given within 3-6 months of the homeowner’s move-in date, though it’s a great idea to have something in hand if they invite you to a housewarming party. [10] X Research source When choosing a housewarming gift, think about what the individual would like. For example, a picture frame may be nice for a couple who just got married, but a couple who’ve been married 50 years likely have as many picture frames as they need. Consider giving the homeowners something useful, like some bathroom hand towels or coasters. These are some little things that may have gotten lost in the move. Learn more gift ideas at the wikiHow forum post , \"What are some unique housewarming gift ideas that are affordable?\" It’s usually best to avoid things that need a lot of care, like houseplants, or things like art or furniture that may not be to their specific taste."
