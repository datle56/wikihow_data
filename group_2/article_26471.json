You may find you enjoy energetic team sports, like baseball, or that you prefer the solitude of a long walk in nature. Once you’ve found a physical activity that you enjoy, aim to do it at least 3 times a week. Try to do some other kind of physical activity 2 other days a week. For example, if you love playing basketball, try playing basketball 3 times a week, and lifting weights twice a week. Switch activities if you get bored. If you get injured, stop doing that activity and go see the doctor. Reader Poll: We asked 174 wikiHow readers they found cardio and aerobic exercises effective for fat loss, and 68% of them said yes.

Talk to your doctor if you’re not sure if you need to lose weight. BMI shows you generally if you are underweight, a healthy weight, or overweight. However, it sometimes is inaccurate, and doesn’t take into consideration all body types. If your BMI is slightly off, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re over- or underweight, so don’t rely on BMI alone. [17] X Research source Girls typically fill out as they hit puberty.
