      "title": "Choose a mold for your stepping stone.",
      "content": "Choose a mold for your stepping stone. Cake pans and pie pans work the best, but you can also use plastic tubs or cardboard boxes. [1] X Research source You can also find special molds for making stepping stones in an arts and crafts store. The mold needs to be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick. If the edges of your mold are not rigid, then you will need to use something to reinforce them until the concrete hardens. This usually takes about 24 hours."

      "title": "Coat the inside of your mold with petroleum jelly or nonstick cooking spray.",
      "content": "Coat the inside of your mold with petroleum jelly or nonstick cooking spray. This will make it easier to remove the stepping stone from the mold. [2] X Research source If you are using a cardboard mold, cover the inside of the mold with a plastic sheet (ie: plastic wrap or a plastic bag) first. It would be a good idea to grease the plastic sheet afterwards as well. Keep in mind that if the plastic has any wrinkles or seams in it, then these will likely show on the concrete as well.

      "title": "Put on protective gear.",
      "content": "Put on protective gear. This is very important. Concrete is dusty and can irritate sensitive skin. It's not something you want getting into your lungs either. Put on a pair of safety goggles, a dust mask, and work gloves. [4] X Research source Make sure to keep your workspace, tools, and mixing equipment tidy and avoid getting concrete on yourself as well. Wash your hands with mild vinegar followed by hand soap and water to reduce irritation to your skin if you get concrete on it. Avoid getting dry or wet concrete in your eyes. If you do get concrete in your eyes, flush them out with generous amounts of cool water immediately. If needed, go to urgent care, an emergency room, or to see an optometrist."

    {
      "title": "Prepare the concrete.",
      "content": "Prepare the concrete. Each brand will be a little different, so follow the instructions on your container closely. If the concrete is very wet, add some more dry concrete powder to it. The concrete should feel like wet sand. You want it to clump together when you squeeze it. [5] X Research source If you plan to mix a few separate batches of concrete, then use measuring cups for the concrete and water to keep the mixtures consistent."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the mold partway with concrete.",
      "content": "Fill the mold partway with concrete. Use a trowel to spread it around so that it covers the bottom layer of the mold. If you are using a square mold, make sure that it reaches and fills the corners. You want it to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. [6] X Research source You can also tap on the edges of the mold to make sure that the concrete spreads out and fills in any air pockets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press some chicken wire into the concrete.",
      "content": "Press some chicken wire into the concrete. Cut a scrap of chicken wire until it is 1 inch (2.5 cm) smaller than your mold. Set it into your mold and gently press it into the wet concrete. This step is not absolutely necessary, but it will help prevent the stepping stone from cracking later on. [7] X Research source If you can't find chicken wire, you can use sturdy, wire mesh instead. This will actually be more durable than wide spaced chicken wire."

      "title": "Pour more concrete on top of the wire.",
      "content": "Pour more concrete on top of the wire. Use a trowel to spread the concrete around and make it smooth. You want this layer to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick as well. [8] X Research source Tap on the edges of the mold again to make sure that the concrete spreads out and fills in any air pockets."

      "title": "Choose your desired mosaics.",
      "content": "Choose your desired mosaics. Mosaic tiles are a popular choice, but you can use other items as well, such as broken pottery, glass gems, sea glass, seashells, and pretty stones. [9] X Research source If you are using glass gems or sea glass, paint the back of each piece with white spray paint. This will help keep them looking bright and prevent the concrete from dulling them down. [10] X Research source Let the paint dry before putting them into a mold. Make sure that there are no sharp or jagged edges sticking out of the concrete, especially if people will walk on the mosaics. This may lead to injuries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press your desired mosaics into the concrete.",
      "content": "Press your desired mosaics into the concrete. You can use a random pattern, or arrange the decorations to make words or images such as a name or the moon and stars. If your decorations are sinking into the concrete, wait about 30 minutes before trying again. This will give the concrete time to set up again. Press the mosaics far enough into the concrete so that they don't stick out. This way, you'll be less likely to tip over them. You can also use a stamp to press mosaics into concrete."

      "title": "Allow the concrete to set for 2 days before removing it.",
      "content": "Allow the concrete to set for 2 days before removing it. After two days, flip the mold over onto a soft surface, such as a patch of grass, a towel, or a blanket. Gently tap the bottom, then lift the mold away. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the stepping stone up.",
      "content": "Clean the stepping stone up. Sand away any rough areas with sandpaper, and fill in any holes with aggregate free cement. Wipe the top of the stepping stone clean with a wet sponge or an old toothbrush. This will remove any cement that got stuck to glass or porcelain tiles or gems. [12] X Research source Let the stepping stone dry before moving on."

    {
      "title": "Seal the stepping stone, if desired.",
      "content": "Seal the stepping stone, if desired. You can leave your stepping stone as is, or you can varnish the top, decorated part to give it that wet look. Sealing the stones will also help them to last longer. A high-quality marine varnish will work especially well here. [13] X Research source You can also use a clear, outdoor-quality varnish instead. [14] X Research source Let the varnish cure completely before using the stone. Curing times are different from drying times. Read the label on your varnish carefully. You only need to varnish the top, decorated part. Pay attention to the finish. A matte finish is not recommended for glass gems or tiles because it will dull them down."

      "content": "Set the stepping stone into your garden. Choose a spot in your garden for the stepping stone. Use a shovel or trowel to dig a shallow, 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep hole in the soil. Set the stone into it, design side up, then gently pat the soil around it to blend it in with the surrounding area. [15] X Research source You can also prop up stepping stones to display them. They do not all have to be flat."

      "content": "Choose a large, sturdy leaf to use as your base. The leaf needs to be at least 10 inches (25 cm) to 12 inches (30 cm) across, otherwise it will be too small to use as a stepping stone. Great leaves include gunnera, hosta, and rhubarb. Make sure that the leaf does not have any holes or tears. [16] X Research source Some cucumber, squash, and pumpkin leaves may also be big enough. Some calla lily leaves may also be large enough. Another option is to lay the leaf or leaves on tracing paper, place the paper on a sturdy base that you can cut to match the leaf shape, and then reinforce the sides with 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of edging."

If there are bits stuck to the concrete, you can scrape them away with water and an old toothbrush. You will be left with a leaf-shaped stepping stone. Depending on how lightweight the concrete was, you may also see the leaf's veins embedded into the concrete. Use a hammer and chisel to chip away any flakes of overhanging concrete on the edges of the stepping stone. [22] X Research source"
