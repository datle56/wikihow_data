      "title": "Wrap earring wire or a paperclip twice around a pen.",
      "content": "Wrap earring wire or a paperclip twice around a pen. You can purchase a spool of earring wire from a craft supply store, or you can use a paperclip that you’ve unwound into a straight line. Grab a standard-sized pen or marker and wrap the wire around the body of the pen twice to make 2 small loops. [1] X Research source Don’t worry about making the loops fit your lip just yet—you’ll be able to adjust the size later on. If you’re using a paper clip, wind it around the pen slowly to avoid snapping it in half. If the wire or paper clip you’re using is old or dirty, wash it with rubbing alcohol or hand soap and water before you make it into a piercing."

      "title": "Cut the ends of the wire off to make an open loop.",
      "content": "Cut the ends of the wire off to make an open loop. Slide the wire off of the pen and trim away the excess wire with wire cutters, leaving a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) ring. Then, trim away the second loop so that you’re left with 1 loop of wire with an opening in 1 side. [2] X Research source If you don’t have wire cutters, you can carefully use very sharp scissors. However, they may not cut as smooth or clean as wire cutters."

      "title": "File the edges or add dots of hot glue so they aren’t sharp anymore.",
      "content": "File the edges or add dots of hot glue so they aren’t sharp anymore. The raw edges of the metal wire can be a little scratchy, and they might hurt your mouth if you put them in right away. Either use a strong metal file to sand down the edges until they’re dull, or add 1 dot of hot glue on either edge and wait for them to dry. [3] X Research source If you use hot glue, you’ll be able to see the small dot of glue on the outside edge of your piercing."

    {
      "title": "Bend the wire until it’s about as wide as your lip.",
      "content": "Bend the wire until it’s about as wide as your lip. Hold the loop of wire in your hands and use your fingers to bend it open until it can fit around your lip. This shouldn’t be too hard to do, since earring wire or paper clips aren’t super strong. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slide the opening over your lip and move it to one side of your mouth.",
      "content": "Slide the opening over your lip and move it to one side of your mouth. Position the ring so that the open side rests against your lip. Slide it downwards so that it’s hooked flat over the top of your lip, then adjust the size or position if you’d like to. [5] X Research source You can put your piercing on 1 side of your lip for a classic lip ring look. Keep it right in the center of your bottom lip for a modern style."

    {
      "title": "Mark a spot just beneath your lower lip with eyeliner.",
      "content": "Mark a spot just beneath your lower lip with eyeliner. Most real lip studs are positioned just below your bottom lip one 1 or both sides, but you can pick wherever you’d like your piercing to go. Make a small dot on your skin with liquid eyeliner so you can map out where you’d like your piercing to be, and try to place it on the skin that’s just below your lower lip. [6] X Research source If you don’t have eyeliner, mark the spot with a small dot of eyelash glue instead. It will be harder to see, but it’s safe to use on your skin. To make fake snake bites, put 2 studs beneath your bottom lip, 1 on either side. For a fake Monroe piercing, add a stud just above the right side of your top lip. For a classic lip piercing, make a dot on just 1 side below your bottom lip."

      "content": "Dip the back of a fake diamond into eyelash glue. To mimic a stud piercing, find a small fake diamond or jewel that has a flat back. Pick it up with tweezers, then dip the back into some eyelash glue. [7] X Research source Eyelash glue is safe for your skin, which is why it’s okay to use for body jewelry. You can find fake diamonds at most craft supply stores."

      "title": "Press the fake diamond onto the dot you made for about 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Press the fake diamond onto the dot you made for about 10 seconds. Make sure the jewel is in the exact spot that you want it before you press it to your skin. Hold it onto your face for about 10 seconds to let the glue dry a little bit so it adheres to your skin. [8] X Research source If the jewel isn’t in the exact spot that you want, you can reposition it while the glue is still wet."

    {
      "title": "Remove the glue with makeup remover when you want to take it off.",
      "content": "Remove the glue with makeup remover when you want to take it off. The great thing about eyelash glue is that it comes off super easily with makeup remover. Dab a little bit onto a cotton swab and press it against the fake piercing for about 10 seconds, then wipe the jewel away. [9] X Research source You can reuse the fake jewel as many times as you’d like to."
