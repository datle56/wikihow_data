      "title": "Fill a free-standing bag stand with sand instead of water.",
      "content": "Fill a free-standing bag stand with sand instead of water. A free-standing punching bag uses a base that you fill with material to help weigh it down. If you have one, go with sand instead of water, which is much heavier and will help keep the stand from moving and sliding. [1] X Research source You can purchase sand from your local home improvement or garden supply store. Sand also shifts around less than water, which can help reduce the bag’s sway and movement."

      "title": "Slide 3 weight plates on each peg if the stand has them.",
      "content": "Slide 3 weight plates on each peg if the stand has them. If your punching bag stand has pegs attached to the bottom, use them to hold weightlifting plates (the kind that fits onto barbells) that will keep the stand from moving. Slide at least 3 plates that weigh 25 pounds (11 kg) each onto the pegs to really stabilize and weigh down your stand. [2] X Research source Weight plates can be expensive to purchase, but you may be able to find some used ones at thrift stores, yard sales, or on online classifieds such as Craigslist. If it’s cheaper, you can use plates that weigh 45 pounds (20 kg), but they may stick out from the stand more."

      "title": "Put 3-4 sandbags on the stand if it doesn’t have pegs.",
      "content": "Put 3-4 sandbags on the stand if it doesn’t have pegs. If your stand doesn’t have pegs attached to the base to hold weight plates, place sandbags on the legs or the base to help hold it still. Use at least 3-4 sandbags and rest them on the stand so they’re stable and won’t slide off. You can buy sandbags at your local home improvement store, hardware store, garden supply store, or even some department stores. Try to use sandbags that weigh around 50 pounds (23 kg) or so to help stabilize your stand."

      "title": "Use cinderblocks or bricks as an alternative to sandbags.",
      "content": "Use cinderblocks or bricks as an alternative to sandbags. Another option if your stand doesn’t have pegs and you don’t have any sandbags is to place heavy objects on it to help hold it still. Use something like cinderblocks, bricks, or even dirt from our yard filled in bags. Put them on your stand’s legs or the base to weigh it down. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that if you use an object that’s too big it can make it difficult for you to move around and use your punching bag."

    {
      "title": "Choose a heavy stand or one with longer legs for greater stability.",
      "content": "Choose a heavy stand or one with longer legs for greater stability. If you’re in the market for a punching bag stand, and you want one that won’t move around as much, choose one that allows you to add weight that keeps it still. Another option is to look for a stand that has a wider base with longer legs, which will help stabilize and keep it still. Visit your local sporting goods or look online for weighted stands or ones that have pegs that allow you to add weightlifting plates to them."

      "title": "Place foam mats beneath the stand to keep it from sliding.",
      "content": "Place foam mats beneath the stand to keep it from sliding. Use 2 packs of interlocking non-slip foam mats to help hold your stand still and keep it from sliding. Place the mats on the floor in the area you plan to use your punching bag and then place the stand on top of it. [4] X Research source As an added bonus, the floor around your punching bag will be nice and cushioned. You could even do some bag work barefoot. You can use the mats on a hard floor indoors or outdoors on concrete."

      "title": "Position the stand against a wall or corner to minimize movement.",
      "content": "Position the stand against a wall or corner to minimize movement. Slide your stand over to a wall or in a corner of the room. Place it against the wall so it won’t slide or move backward when you hit the bag. [5] X Research source Putting the stand against a wall also helps keep it contained in an area of the room, rather than taking up a bunch of space in the middle. Placing the stand in a corner could make it difficult for you to move around the stand, but it will also help keep it from moving. If you want a little more movement, place the stand against a wall instead."

      "title": "Attach an anchor weight to the heavy bag to stabilize it.",
      "content": "Attach an anchor weight to the heavy bag to stabilize it. A heavy bag anchor weight is a weighted pad that helps keep the bag stable and minimize its movement when you hit it. Connect the anchor to the bottom of your punching bag to help keep your stand from moving or sliding around. [6] X Research source You can get punching bag anchor weights at boxing supply stores or by ordering them online. Anchor weights are for stands that have hanging bags and can’t be attached to free-standing punching bags."

      "title": "Hang the bag from a heavy bag spring to control the sway.",
      "content": "Hang the bag from a heavy bag spring to control the sway. A bag spring is a spring that connects your punching bag to your stand and helps absorb the impact of your punches, which reduces the swinging and swaying of the bag. If your stand uses a hanging punching bag, attach a bag spring to the stand and then hang your bag from it to help minimize its movement. [7] X Research source Heavy bag springs cost between $10-$20 USD and you can find them at your local sporting goods store or boxing supply store. You can also order them online."

      "title": "Use good punching technique",
      "content": "Use good punching technique to keep the stand from shifting. Focus on throwing quality punches with crisp technique instead of super hard punches or wild haymakers, which can cause the bag to swing around and move the stand. If you’re new to boxing or using a punching bag, try taking a boxing class to learn how to throw a proper punch. [8] X Research source Throwing good punches will also give you a better workout and reduce your chances of injury. It’s okay to throw a hard punch here and there, but if you’re just knocking the bag around, you may not be using good technique and it could cause your stand to slide and shift. You can also look up some boxing tutorials online to learn how to throw a proper punch."
