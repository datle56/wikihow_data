How you smell throughout the day can make or break your attractiveness — if you get it right, people will be automatically drawn closer to you. If you get it wrong, though, it can have the opposite effect and actually repel people. Here are some basic guidelines to follow: Don't wear too much. This is the most important thing about smelling good — it can't be too strong because it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Even roses can smell nauseating if you take a big whiff of concentrated rose oil. Do two or three pumps of cologne/after-shave maximum and only three pumps of body spray. Your nose will get used to the scent and stop smelling it after a few minutes, but other people can still smell you. Find a scent that works with your natural smell. Everyone's body chemistry is slightly different, and as a result, not every scent fits every person. There are smells that \"work\" on some people and start to smell terrible on others. If you can, sample a cologne or body spray before you buy it. Wear it around for a day, and ask a friend to tell you how it smells a few hours later. Try to match up your body wash and your cologne/ aftershave . They don't have to be the same scent, but they should be similar so that they don't produce a clashing smell. Put cologne/after-shave over pulse points. The parts of your body where large amounts of blood are flowing close to the surface will be a little bit warmer throughout the day, which will heat up the cologne/after-shave slightly and make it smell stronger. Common areas include the wrists, throat, and back of the neck."

Skip toner, and use a light moisturizer . Combination /T-zone skin: If your forehead, nose, and chin (or \"T-zone\") tend to be oily but your cheeks are dry, you have \"combination\" skin. Most people have this skin type, so look for a cleanser that's marketed for normal or combination skin. Use a gentle toner on your T-zone, and finish up with a moisturizer. Oily skin: If your skin tends to be uniformly oily, find a clay-based or drying cleanser. Use a gentle toner everywhere on your face, and finish with a light moisturizer. If your skin feels oily during the day, pick up some face-blotting tissues from the skin-care section of the drugstore and pat them on your skin in the afternoon. If you have acne, use a salicylic acid face wash and put benzoyl peroxide cream on pimples. If this doesn't help, see a dermatologist."

Alternatively (and pain-freely), you can buy a hair trimmer inexpensively - which is also handy if you have visible nose or ear hair. Use the rest of your face as a guideline. Find a pencil and hold it up to the edge of one nostril, so that the pencil crosses your eyebrow. Hair that runs past the pencil and into the \"unibrow\" zone over your nose should be plucked. Do this for the other side as well. Clean up your arches. If your brows still look a bit bushy after you've plucked or trimmed the middle, you can try removing a bit from beneath your arches.

Use pomade or hair wax for a shiny, wet look; use hair clay for a matte, natural tone. Gel. Unlike pomade, gel contains alcohol that dries out hair and makes for a stiffer hold. For the strongest hold, apply gel to wet hair. Hair glue. Ever wonder how some people get their mohawks to stand straight up? They're probably using some variation of hair glue, which provides the strongest possible hold. Be wary of product build-up, and wash hair thoroughly. Ask your hairdresser's advice!

In general, the bottom of your pants (trousers) should touch your shoes, long-sleeved shirts should cover your wrists, and the bottom of your shirt should hit your hips. Even underwear must fit well! Be prepared to try on several items for each one you end up buying. If a store doesn't have something that looks great on you, go somewhere else - don't just settle for something that looks OK. Don't buy clothes online - you won't have tried them on first, so they are unlikely to fit well.

Whether you're embarrassed about being too large or too skinny, trying to cover it up with baggy clothing only makes you look worse.

Maybe you have thin hips but long legs, and you can't find a pair of jeans that accommodates both. Buy clothing that's slightly larger than you need, and find someone to take it in so that it fits your measurements. Most dry cleaning businesses will do alterations for a fair price. Get rid of old clothes. You might love that old T-shirt from high school, but it probably doesn't fit well anymore. Clothes and your body change size and shape over time.

Here are some basic tests to try: Determine whether you look better in white or off-white. Try holding a stark white shirt up to your face, then an off-white shirt. If you're like most people, you'll look notably better next to one or the other. Once you figure it out, stick to what works. Determine whether you look better in black or brown. This one isn't as clear-cut as white, but some people look notably better in black over brown, and vice versa. When you settle on one, don't mix the colors — for instance, don't wear brown shoes and a brown belt with black dress trousers. Wear black shoes, black pants, and a black belt, or all brown. Try to figure out if you prefer \"warm\" or \"cool\" colors. Cool colors are generally based on blues, purples, dark greens, and blue-based reds, while warm colors are based on yellows, oranges, browns, and yellow-based reds. An easy way to figure this out is to find something that's blue-red and something that's yellow-red, and hold them up to your face. Which one looks better with your skin tone?

The primary core lifts are Bench Press, Squat, Overhead Press, and Deadlift. Weighted pull-ups and dips can be great accessories to these. If you need more chest work, consider doing Incline Press. If you would rather do more explosive workouts, consider Power Clean, Push-press. If this still isn't enough, consider doing bar snatch, workouts w/jerk, hang clean w/front squat, or other dumbbell lifts. If you have a membership, great, use the bar primarily, and use machines such as lat pulldowns to supplement. Walk, jog, ride your bicycle, or run for 30 minutes or for a mile or two as well (if you ride a bike, run, jog, or walk to school or work, then you can get well-exercised just walking, jogging, running, or riding your bike; this works on your stomach, legs, and back).
