      "content": "Do squats. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and slowly lower your butt towards the ground, as if you’re going to sit in a chair. Go as low as you can without bringing your butt below knee level. Hold for a few seconds at the lowest point, then slowly raise yourself back up. Do 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions. Squats are one of the best exercises you can do to build up your backside, so make sure to include squats in your strength training routine. If squatting with your bodyweight alone doesn’t feel difficult, then add some weights . Hold a barbell with both hands and rest it across the back of your shoulders while you squat."

      "content": "Do single leg squats for more intensity. Stand on one leg and bend your knee slightly, making sure your knee does not go past your toes. As you do this, lift your opposite leg to just above knee height. You can extend your hands or hold onto a wall or sturdy chair to help with balance. Push your heel into the floor and hold this position for 10 to 15 seconds. [2] X Research source Do 3 sets of 5 to 10 on each leg. Start with shallow squats and try going deeper with each repetition."

      "content": "Do lunges. Stand with your shoulders back and your feet about shoulder-width apart. Step forward with one leg and lower your hips until your knees on both your front and back legs are at 90 degree angles. Make sure your front knee is positioned directly above your ankle – pushing your knee over your ankle can cause muscle strain. Hold your back knee just above the floor, but not touching it. Hold your body in this position for 3 to 5 seconds before returning to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 lunges on each leg. Add weight to increase the intensity of your lunges . Hold a small dumbbell in each hand to make this exercise harder and intensify the strength training benefits. Lunges can help prepare and strengthen your glutes for more intense strength training exercises, such as deadlifts and squats.

Instead of returning to a starting position after a standard lunge, push-off with your front foot and step forward directly into a lunge on your opposite foot. [3] X Research source Do 3 sets of 10 lunges on each leg. Reduce knee strain by taking smaller steps and going slow. The most important thing is technique, alignment, and balance – not speed."

      "content": "Include bridge lifts. Lay down on the floor facing up. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor and about shoulder-width apart. Raise your hips while squeezing your butt so you form a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Hold this position for 3 seconds, and then lower your body to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions twice per week, taking a short break between each round. Bridge exercises help you achieve a rounded butt, and may also help prevent injuries by strengthening and stretching the muscles in your butt and lower back. [4] X Research source To make this exercise harder, lift one foot off the ground and extend your leg so that it is above your hips. Then, lift using only one leg."

      "content": "Try planks. Get into push-up position on the floor. Bend your elbows 90 degrees and lower your forearms to the ground. Your elbows, forearms, and fists should be flat on the ground and supporting your weight. Make sure your elbows are directly beneath your shoulders, and curl your toes under your feet and pull your belly button in toward your spine. Straighten your body so that it forms a straight line from your heels through your spine to your neck and head. Finally, engage your core and butt by flexing (tightening) your abdominal muscles and glutes. Hold this position for at least 30 seconds and then relax. Repeat the exercise 3 times. Planks are a great total-body exercise that strengthen and tone your glutes, core, shoulders, and arms. [5] X Research source Try lifting up one leg at a time while you are in the plank position and holding it for 5 to 10 seconds. Incorporating leg lifts into your plank exercise will give your glutes an added workout. Avoid injury by doing this exercise on a yoga mat or carpeted surface. Planks are a great way to work-up to weight training. Once you can hold a plank for one to two minutes, you are in good shape to start heavy weight exercises. [6] X Research source"

Pull the weight off the floor by straightening your legs, making sure your back stays flat, your arms are straight, and the bar is close to your body. Your shoulders, trunk, and hips should move and rise up at the same speed. As you stand upright, imagine your feet pushing through the floor. Exhale as you near the top of the lift. Keep lifting until you are in a fully upright position. Your legs should be straight, with your shoulders back and chest out. Keep your arms straight and do not lift the bar above your hips. Take a breath at the top and then exhale as you slowly lower the bar back down. Do 3-5 sets of 6-10 repetitions. Try going directly from one repetition to the next. If you have to take a break, do it for only a few seconds. You can take a longer break (1 to 2 minutes) in between sets. Do not bounce the barbell when setting it down on the floor. Stop as the plates make contact with the ground."

[7] X Research source Shapewear tights and shorts may also help. You can mix and match shapewear to emphasize – or de-emphasize – different parts of your body. [8] X Research source Pieces that slim your thighs and stomach without compressing your rear lend themselves to creating the look of a more toned, rounded butt. Purchase shapewear designed to flatten your midsection while lifting and separating your butt cheeks, giving your butt a larger, perkier appearance. [9] X Research source Do not purchase shapewear in a smaller size. Not only will you have difficulty fitting into it, but too-tight shapewear can lead to health problems. [10] X Research source"

Flaunt what you’ve got with pants, dresses, and skirts that are fitted around the butt, but are not tight enough to flatten your backside. This includes wearing pants, dresses, and skirts that fit snugly but aren’t too tight. Dressing in clothes that flatter your body type can also help. [11] X Research source If you have a large bust but slim waist (ice-cream cone or triangle shape), minimize the bust while drawing attention to the hips and butt. Choose A-line skirts and dresses that flare out at the hips. Define your waist with belted jackets, tops, or dresses. Avoid skinny jeans or pants that taper at the ankle, as well as skin-tight clothing. If you have a boyish or athletic body type, try wearing jeans, pants, or skirts that sit an inch or two below your waist. Accentuate curves with tailored jackets and wrap dresses. For slim individuals, select jeans that have some embellishment – such as embroidery or beaded design – on the back pockets. Avoid oversized or baggy tops and bottoms. If you are smaller on top but larger on the bottom ( pear or teardrop shape), try to create a balanced look by wearing bottoms that sit at the waist. These include empire-waist dresses, A-line skirts, and wrap dresses. Avoid skinny jeans or pants that taper at the ankle, tucking your shirt in, or wearing jackets that extend below your waist."

It is important to get in the habit of maintaining good posture when sitting and standing. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When standing, balance your weight on the balls of your feet, keep your knees slightly bent, position your legs shoulder-width apart, and let your arms hang naturally along the sides of your body. Your shoulders should be pulled backward, your stomach tucked in, and your ears in line with your shoulders. When sitting, place your feet on the floor or a footrest with your ankles positioned in front of your knees, maintain a small gap between your thighs, and avoid crossing your legs. You should sit with your shoulders relaxed and your ears, shoulders, and hips lined up. Avoid sitting for long periods of time as this can cause your gluteal muscles to atrophy."

However, this is an extreme and expensive option. Procedures range from $4,300 to $4,900 dollars on average, and include fat grafting or transfer, buttock implants, and buttock lifts. [13] X Research source Plastic surgery should only be considered once all other options have been exhausted, and should only be performed in a sterile environment by a licensed medical doctor. Complications of butt augmentation surgeries include infection, bleeding, nerve damage, scarring, implant rupture, blood clots, deep vein thrombosis, asymmetry, and other risks.
