Each school is unique and has its own uniform style and dress code, and knowing the dress code for your school can help you accessorize, customize, and alter your uniform to make yourself feel more comfortable in it.

      "content": "Check out your uniform options. Most school uniforms have multiple options, including dresses, skirts, pants, and shorts for the bottoms, which are often paired with a long- or short-sleeved dress shirt. But if you're lucky, optional uniform items might also include a blazer, vest, or sweater that can each be worn in unique ways. These different clothing items can be worn in different combinations to accommodate the weather and your own personal style, and there are different ways you can alter the look of each to make it look a little cooler."

[2] X Expert Source Christina Santelli Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 22 April 2019. But if your uniform is the wrong size for whatever reason, you may be able to: Tuck in your shirt to make it less baggy Wear a belt around your waist to give your uniform more shape Tie the bottom of your shirt in a knot to make it fit better Alter your clothes to make them slightly larger or smaller"

      "content": "Throw something on over your shirt. Whether you have to wear a polo shirt, blouse, or button-down shirt, your school’s dress code policy may allow you to wear other clothing overtop, and this could give you an opportunity to add some style to your outfit. For instance, you could: Wear a fitted or oversized knit sweater over your shirt Put on a funky cardigan or vest Wear a fitted blazer or jacket"

      "content": "Layer clothes under your uniform. This works best when you can leave a few buttons undone at the top of your shirt, because you can wear either a neutral or vibrant shirt, tank top, or camisole under your shirt and let it show through around the neck area. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll up your hems and cuffs. Roll up the cuffs on a long-sleeved shirt so that it sits at elbow-level, and roll up the cuffs on a short-sleeved shirt to make it more of a cap-sleeve style.

      "content": "Swap out uniform pieces with similar clothes. For schools that are more lenient with their uniform policies, you may be able to get away with replacing drab and boring pieces of your uniform with very similar but slightly more flattering clothing items. For instance, if your uniform requires you to wear slacks or dress pants, you may be able to get away with regular pants in the same color that are a bit better fitting or have a different cut."

      "content": "Put on a belt or sash. A funky accessory like this can be very helpful if you have to tuck your shirt into high-waisted bottoms. Even if you can't get away with a crazy belt, try adding some interest with a plain belt outfitted with a unique belt buckle. If you're wearing a skirt with a shirt tucked in, try tying a sash or ribbon around the waist of the skirt. You can also leave your dress shirt untucked over a skirt and pair it with a chunky belt at the waist."

For schools that don’t allow uniform alterations, personalization, and additional clothing items, you may at least be able to get away with a few accessories here and there. Scarves are great accessories for look and added warmth, and you might even be able to sneak some color into your outfit this way."

      "content": "Add flair with jewelry. How much jewelry you can wear will depend on your school, but if you're allowed to wear it, jewelry can be a great way to jazz up a uniform. Try wearing multiple bracelets on one wrist You can also layer multiple rings on a single finger Basic chains can add a touch of class, but a colorful necklace can completely change your look If you aren't allowed to wear jewelry at all, try wrapping a headband or hair elastics around your wrist."

There are many trendy hairstyles that will bring a whole new element to your uniform, and as long as you don’t try any crazy dye colors, you might be surprised at the hairstyles you can get away with. If you have long hair, try a side braid, bun, or twist at the top of your head. To add extra color or interest to your hair, you can also wear bright headbands, flowers, ribbons, and bows. For girls with medium-length wavy hair, you can either leave it loose and shaggy, bed-head messy, or combed back for a more professional look."

The basic school uniform usually consists of pants or shorts that are paired with a dress shirt, but you may also have the option of a blazer, a vest, or a sweater that can be worn over your shirt. These different apparel items can be paired differently to achieve different looks, and there are various style choices you can make with each to make your uniform a little more unique. Pick clothing in the right size, because the baggy look is mostly out, and clothes that are too tight will be uncomfortable."
