[10] X Research source A sense of entitlement can make it hard to work with others, and you may lose a lot of opportunities to collaborate and connect with others if you’re only concerned with what you want. Practice mindfulness to help yourself become more aware of the other people around you. Listen carefully when others speak and take some time to analyze your own feelings and thoughts. Being aware of your own thought processes can help you identify moments where you may be acting entitled. Ask yourself questions like, “Why do I think I deserve this?” and “How might my words/actions affect others?”"

For example, the number 27 would reduce down to 9 (2 + 7 = 9). To find your Life Path Number, first reduce the numbers of your birth day, month, and year. Then, add those 3 digits together, and reduce the final sum again if need be. The resulting single digit is your Life Path Number. [24] X Research source As an example, the process of finding the Life Path Number for someone born on September 12, 1994 would look like the following: Day: Reduce 12 once to get a final sum of 3 (1 + 2 = 3). Month: 9 There’s no need to do a reduction since 9 is already a single-digit number. Year: Add the 4 digits together to get a sum of 23 (1 + 9 + 9 + 4 = 23). Then, reduce this to get a final sum of 5 (2 + 3 = 5). Life Path Number: Add the reduced day (3), month (9), and year (5) to get a sum of 17 (3 + 9 + 5 = 17). Reduce this one last time to get a final Life Path Number of 8 (1 + 7 = 8)."
