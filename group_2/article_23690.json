      "title": "Make sure you’re getting plenty of calcium to keep your bones strong.",
      "content": "Make sure you’re getting plenty of calcium to keep your bones strong. Calcium is the single most abundant mineral in your body, and about 99% of it is found in your bones and teeth. Getting sufficient calcium will help you grow healthy bones and maintain bone density. Focus on eating foods that contain lots of calcium to maintain bone density. The recommended daily intake of calcium varies depending on your age and sex. [1] X Research source Adult men under 70 and women under 50 should get at least 1,000mg of calcium per day. Men over 70 and women over 50 should get at least 1,200mg per day. Pregnant or lactating women should consume at least 1,300mg of calcium daily. Many dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are very rich sources of calcium. [2] X Research source If you choose soy milk, almond milk, or other dairy substitutes, look for ones that have been fortified with calcium. Vegetable sources rich in calcium include turnips and collard greens, bok choi, black-eyed peas, kale, and broccoli. [3] X Research source Sardines and salmon are also excellent sources of calcium and omega-3 fatty acids, which are vital for brain health. In addition, they contain vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. Choose whole-grain breakfast cereals that have been fortified with calcium and other nutrients and are low in sugar. Because many people eat these cereals daily with milk, they’re a good, consistent source of calcium. Calcium is also available in dietary supplements. The two main forms are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. But don’t take calcium supplements without first talking to your doctor because too much calcium can have unpleasant side effects, including the possibility of kidney stones."

      "title": "Add vitamin D rich foods to your diet to help your body absorb calcium.",
      "content": "Add vitamin D rich foods to your diet to help your body absorb calcium. Vitamin D helps improve your body’s ability to absorb calcium. It's also a crucial component in bone rebuilding. People under the age of 70 should get at least 600IU of vitamin D daily; people over 70 should get at least 800IU daily. Make sure you’re adding foods that contain vitamin D to your diet to help with calcium absorption so you can build strong and healthy bones. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Fatty fish, such as swordfish, salmon, tuna, and mackerel are the best sources of natural vitamin D. Beef liver, cheese, some mushrooms, and egg yolks contain small amounts of vitamin D. [5] X Research source Milk is commonly fortified with vitamins A and D. Many beverages and cereals are also enriched with vitamin D. Spending time in the sunshine is another great way to get vitamin D. Ultraviolet rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in your body, but people who have darker skin produce less vitamin D this way. Use a sunscreen with a broad-spectrum SPF of at least 15 whenever you spend time outside.
