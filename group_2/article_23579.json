      "title": "Conduct side block tackles when you're near your opponent's net.",
      "content": "Conduct side block tackles when you're near your opponent's net. If the opposing team/opposition passes you or is moving diagonally past, the side block tackle can put the ball back into their net area. After moving shoulder-to-shoulder with the dribbler, turn inward using the foot closest to the opponent as leverage and turn your shoulders and hips toward them. Crouch down and hook your outside foot toward the ball rapidly. Side blocks are best used near the opponent's net because missing a tackle doesn't put you at as much of a disadvantage. Use side block tackles to regain possession of the ball or break the ball free—both beneficial situations when you're close to the opponent's net. Remember: tackling is intended to take the ball from your opponent, not to knock them over or hurt them."

      "title": "Perform slide tackles",
      "content": "Perform slide tackles only as a last resort. Start from one side of the field, and have a partner dribble the ball to the goal. Run alongside them and attempt to slide tackle the ball from them when you think your foot can overtake the ball. At this point, sink down onto the leg closest to the ball by letting it curl underneath you. Afterwards, sweep your outside leg around, keeping your foot locked in a hook position. [1] X Research source Once you sweep your foot, you can either hit the ball away or trap it with your hooked foot. Slide tackles should be considered a last resort since they take you off your feet. Save them for moments when you're close enough to the offense that your lead foot has a good chance of overtaking the ball."

      "title": "Avoid tackling when your opponent is close to your team's net.",
      "content": "Avoid tackling when your opponent is close to your team's net. When the offense is close to your net, a failed tackle will give your defense a hit. In these situations, approach the offense defensively—apply pressure, try to read their moves, and cut off passes and attacks on the net whenever you can. These defensive techniques eliminate the need for tackling. There are exceptions to this rule. For example, when the offense is right about to make a kick, a properly timed slide tackle can take the ball back. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep confidence and commitment to win the ball.",
      "content": "Keep confidence and commitment to win the ball. Establishing yourself as the player who is going to win the ball not only boosts your confidence, it helps your teammates build confidence and take more aggressive action. It has nothing to do with skill, which should be developed after you have the confidence to tackle without hesitation. [3] X Research source Before making a tackle, tell yourself that you're going to win the ball. If you doubt yourself before making your tackle, even the best technique in the world will become less effective."

      "title": "Learn to close the gap and contain the offense.",
      "content": "Learn to close the gap and contain the offense. Before tackling, approach the dribbler as fast as you can. After getting closer to them, get into a defensive position by bending your knees, keeping your feet parallel to your shoulders, and focusing your weight on the balls of your feet (as opposed to your heels). Be ready to make a tackle, but be patient and apply pressure before making a move. Face the offense with as much of your body as possible. Often, this pressure is enough to make the dribbler slip up and lose the ball. Always be ready to move quickly when you start closing the gap."

      "title": "Plant your off-foot firmly into the ground before tackling.",
      "content": "Plant your off-foot firmly into the ground before tackling. Always keep your foot firmly planted to ensure that you have enough balance and body control at the moment of tackling. Your weight should be over the ball—not under—when you make the tackle. Never lunge for the ball."

      "title": "Focus your force on the ball, not the player.",
      "content": "Focus your force on the ball, not the player. Always make first contact with the ball. You want to be aggressive enough that you take the ball from your opponent, but not so much that you knock them over or hurt them. Always keep your knees facing the direction of the offensive dribbler."

Place your feet against a wall, lift your head and shoulders from the floor, hold the position for 3 deep breaths, and then return to the starting position.

      "content": "Conduct bridges to build muscle core muscles all at once. Lie down on your back, bend your knees, and keep your back neutral—not against the floor, but not arched either. After you achieve proper form, tighten your abdominal muscles and raise your hips from the floor to make your body an \"L\" shape. Hold this position for 3 deep breaths, and then return to the starting position. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be sure that your hips, shoulders, and knees form a straight line (the long side of the \"L\" shape). Never tilt your hips."

Tighten your abdominal muscles and let your knees fall to the left at a slow, steady pace. Once you feel a stretch, hold the position for 3 deep breaths, and then return to the starting position. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep your back in a neutral position—not arched, but not against the floor Always keep your shoulders pressed to the floor, and only go as far as you can while still comfortable. Repeat this exercise, but let your legs fall to the right instead. Never let your legs fall to the point where you feel pain."

      "title": "Find a partner and drive through the ball at the same time.",
      "content": "Find a partner and drive through the ball at the same time. Stand on opposite sides of the ball. Approach the ball at the same time as your partner and perform a tackling motion with your kicking leg. Repeat this motion continuously, starting out at slow speeds and gradually working your way up to the speed of a standard running kick. [7] X Research source Keep your ankles and knees locked tightly during the kick. Be careful not to come in too hard—always hit the ball with the same force as your partner. Time your kicks so that they hit the ball simultaneously. This drill is a great way to get familiar with the proper form for tackling. Eventually, it will become second nature. Remember: sometimes the best way to improve is to go back and brush up on the basics."

      "content": "Pair up with a friend for the \"surprise effect\" drill. Begin at the south side of the field and have your partner play defense (facing the south net) while you play offense (facing the north net). Begin the game by kicking the ball to your partner, and continue passing the ball back and forth while your partner moves backwards and you move forwards. Once you touch the ball more than once, attempt to break through the finish line. [8] X Research source Switch roles and start at a different end of the field for each round. Each successful breakthrough is equal to 1 point. Continue the game until 10 points."

      "title": "Practice block tackling against oncoming dribblers.",
      "content": "Practice block tackling against oncoming dribblers. Find a partner, give them the ball, and have them attempt to dribble past you. A block tackle involves the following motions: approaching offense; crouching down; leaning slightly forward; moving your foot back; locking your angle; pointing your toe to the outside; and kicking the ball. [9] X Research source Keep your center of gravity low and crouch to help create enough force to break your opponent's momentum. This is especially important in crowded areas, and allows you to stop the attacker and open up a window for your defense to take the ball. Always hit the ball with the arched middle part of your foot, also known as the instep. Move your foot as if it's going to go through the ball as opposed to simply stopping it. Move your leading shoulder—which is the one on the same side as your kicking foot—forward as your foot hits the ball."
