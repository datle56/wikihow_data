      "content": "Give him the time to see how much he misses having you around. Not having you in his orbit will likely leave a gap he has to work to fill. Instead, get ready to be the life of your own party. Eyedealism says a Sagittarius man loves nothing more than his freedom. So, if you try to chase after him in an attempt to mend things, you might do more harm than good. Instead, let things cool down and give him some space . Staying quiet on your end while you have fun on your own might just pique his ever-present curiosity. [1] X Research source Eyedealism says a Sag man might view constant communication as clingy or even controlling. According to her, “the second…you want this, that, and the other from [him], then [he’ll] take off.” Instead, wait for him to contact you. Eyedealism says if he starts “approaching you and coming forward,” that’s “a huge sign of interest.” Going no-contact for a few weeks can be a great way to prevent yourself from talking to him as you cope with the breakup while also helping to grab his attention."

      "content": "Grab his attention by posting about any new interests. Write about a new club you joined with your friends. Take up hiking to a beautiful lake on summer days or studying a subject you think would interest him. Show yourself off having fun with some friends or going to a new gallery in a museum, and he might wish he was with you instead of running around in his own company. [2] X Research source Sagittarius men are explorers at heart who love learning and trying new things, so he’ll be impressed by your dedication to expanding your horizons.

      "content": "Show your Sagittarius ex that you are independent and free. If you were too busy with him to enjoy some solo hobbies like painting, reading, or skiing, don’t be afraid to jump right back into the fray. You’re your own person who deserves to have all the experiences in the world, so get out there and enjoy yourself and your own company. If you’re out having so much fun by yourself, your ex might regret losing you and missing out on such a great time. [4] X Research source Eyedealism says a Sag man “wants somebody who gives [him] space” and has their own life, too. So, showing him that you don’t need him by your side to live your life is a great way to make him regret losing you. For instance, spend your time apart going after goals in your professional or personal life. Nurture your existing friendships and make new friends , too. Sag men love adventuring and exploring, so make traveling a priority if you can. Visit friends and family who live far away from you, or take that solo trip you’ve always wanted to go on."

      "content": "The mundane is boring to a Sag man, so push yourself to adventure. If you usually go hiking on a trail, take it a step further and try some rock climbing. Do you visit libraries to read the oldest books you can? Try learning a new language and translating a line of these old texts. Don’t let yourself get boxed in and continue broadening your horizons to show him you don’t need him to push you beyond your comfort zone. [5] X Research source Sag men are adventurous, bold spirits who love spontaneity. Develop a “say yes” attitude and live in the moment to help pique his interest. Go on an impromptu trip with a friend, sign up for a random class on a whim, or step into shops you’ve never been in while strolling down the street. Sagittarius men love to explore the world as well as their minds. These reflective signs are drawn to philosophy and the mysteries of life, so broaden your horizons inward, too! For instance, read about different cultures and religions and take time to discover yourself ."

If you’re comfortable showing yourself off, slip into something that makes you feel sexy and snap a photo or two to share. If you picked up a new outfit for yourself that makes you feel confident and stunning, don’t hide it. Grab a few friends and have a mini photoshoot, or take a few selfies to post. It might be enough to make him regret leaving you behind. [6] X Research source Above all, having self-confidence is the sexiest accessory. Besides dressing in clothes that make you feel good, take pride in your accomplishments and know your worth . When he sees you with your head held high and a smile on your face, he’ll likely have a hard time staying away."

[7] X Research source Sagittarius men are optimists who always look at the bright side instead of dwelling on the negative. They also admire this in a partner, so if your ex sees you being happy-go-lucky and living life to the fullest, he might just want to get you back."

A new romance can be just as exciting, if not more so, than any adventures the Sagittarius man might go on, so don’t be afraid to get back out there . Getting out on the town might be just what you need to fire yourself up. Dating someone new might also make him regret losing such a great partner to the competition. Grab his attention with your new adventures and new partner in crime. [9] X Research source However, don’t start dating again if you only want to make your ex jealous. Sag men aren’t the jealous type and don’t usually respond to games, so trying to rile him up with a new partner can just end up pushing him further away. [10] X Research source Don’t be afraid to give yourself time before heading back out there. Ending a relationship is tough, so if you don’t feel like jumping back in right away, a casual night out on the town might be better. Meeting new people doesn’t have to feel like pressure to land someone new right away, so take things as slowly as you need to. [11] X Research source"

Though not essential to the Sagittarius man, showing off your work accomplishments can be a great way to demonstrate your best traits, especially if you have a career dealing with something he enjoys. Otherwise, showing him how driven, motivated, and ultimately successful you are can be a great indicator to him that he’s missing out on something. [12] X Research source Show off that promotion or raise too, if you want. Sagittarius men are lucky with money but also driven and motivated, so if you can show him that you’ve put your heart into something and accomplished great things, he’ll miss having you around to make him the best version of himself.

For instance, tell him you’ve got some exciting projects going on without going into all the details. Send him a picture of a great read you picked up without telling him where you got it. Or, snap a picture and post it on social media without adding a caption about where you’ve been. This gets his mind racing by trying to figure out just what you’ve been up to. For instance, if he asks you what you’re doing on Friday night, simply tell him you’re hanging out with friends. Don’t specify who you’ll be with or what you’ll be doing. When texting or DMing him on social media, wait a while before you respond to him. This shows him that you have other things going on in your life besides waiting for his messages, which can make him curious and get him to chase you again ."

So, stick to joking around with him, talking about your hobbies, and sharing the adventures you’ve both been on. [15] X Research source Seeing that you two can have a lighthearted relationship and that you aren’t pressuring him into anything serious can make him miss your company and want to reconnect. Sagittarius men are intellectual signs, so don’t be afraid to engage your ex in a fiery debate, ask about his perspective on the world, or talk about interesting religions and cultures.

Seeing that you are genuine and sincere can jump-start a convo about your relationship and rekindle your romance. [16] X Research source Eyedealism advises against being overly emotional or gushy when telling a Sag man about how you feel, as this can scare him off. Instead, tell him that you miss the fun adventures you used to share and want to talk about getting back to that place. Tell him that you’ve worked on the issues in your relationship and show him the evidence, like sticking to your word or being honest with him. Apologize for any mistakes you made and ask for his forgiveness, too."

As the archer-centaur of the zodiac, Sagittarius men love nothing more than to explore, from chasing after thrilling experiences to reading up on the world’s mysteries.

While they might prefer casual and open relationships, they’ll settle down for someone who’s just as freedom-loving and spontaneous as they are. [17] X Research source Sag men are cheerful and positive, exuding confidence and charisma wherever they go. So, they never have a shortage of interested dates! Sag men are fire signs who are impulsive, passionate, and bold. They get bored easily, so if they aren’t constantly stimulated, they’ll run away towards the next thing (or person) that excites them.

They’re daring and bold because they know things tend to work out in their favor!"
