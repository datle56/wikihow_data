If you're using an open ring pessary, you should see notches along the inside. If you're using a ring-with-support pessary, you should see openings along the center support structure. Both of these areas are the flexible points you will need to fold, and you should grab the ring in between these points. The pessary should only be able to fold in these areas."

If altering the placement of your pessary does not resolve any discomfort or other problems, the pessary may not be the right size or style. You will need to consult your doctor at this point."

If the pessary did fall out, scrub it clean with mild soap and hot water. Allow the pessary to soak in rubbing alcohol for 20 minutes, then soak the device in clean water for another 20 minutes.

Continue seeing the doctor every three months until a full year passes. After using the pessary for a full year, you can usually schedule an examination for only two or three times a year."

The vaginal walls should usually stretch adequately well for you to remove the device even without folding it, however. If you have difficulty sliding it out, bear down as though you are having a bowel movement. This action can help push the rim of the pessary forward, making it easy to grab and pull out."
