      "title": "Work your abs",
      "content": "Work your abs harder than anything else. A six-pack stomach is one of the main draws for a male stripper. You’ll want to work your abs more frequently, and harder, than your other muscles. Do abs five to six times a week, making sure to hit the upper, lower, and oblique abdominal muscles. [1] X Research source It’s important to move slowly through the full motion of ab exercises. Don’t swing your arms up or bounce your back off the ground. Momentum reduces the work your abs have to do. Effectively sculpting your abs requires you to do a high number of reps during each workout. Even if you start with a low number, keep working to increase your daily reps. Don’t do the exact same exercises every day. Mix it up to keep your muscles from getting into a routine."

      "title": "Train each muscle group in your upper body.",
      "content": "Train each muscle group in your upper body. It’s important to sculpt your whole torso, not just your pecs and biceps. Find a workout routine that rotates through biceps and triceps, chest building lifts, and shoulder and back lifts. Hit each set of muscles once or twice a week. [2] X Research source Body-weight exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, and dips are great for toning your muscles. Doing a basic weight machine circuit at the gym will help you make sure to hit all of your muscle groups. Try out a few weight routines to find the one that sculpts your body best. Not every workout routine works for every guy."

      "title": "Lift lighter weights for more reps.",
      "content": "Lift lighter weights for more reps. Don’t always grab the heaviest weights and barely perform a few reps. Pick some lighter weights, and do quality reps because it works your muscles better. It’s more about sculpting your physique than it is about gaining lots of muscle mass. [3] X Research source Do a heavy weight day once a week or so to keep things varied. High weights help you pack on muscle mass, so you don’t want to neglect it completely. Aim for 8 to 12 reps to build up muscles most effectively. You will need a barbell and a couple of kettlebells or dumbbells. It kind of depends on what your body is like to start with. If you have solid muscle hidden under fat, low rep workouts help you tone and lose the fat."

      "title": "Work your legs.",
      "content": "Work your legs. Guys who are new to working out tend to focus too much upper body, but your legs need to look good, too. Squats and leg presses are great for building muscle. If you don’t have access to weights, body squats, lunges, and kicks are great for sculpting your legs. [4] X Research source Other types of plyometric workouts are good for combining legs and cardio work. Run up and down stairs, do jump ropes, or do high knees to work your legs. Find a balance between muscle-building workouts where you lift weights and toning workouts."

      "title": "Do cardio a few times a week.",
      "content": "Do cardio a few times a week. Don’t underestimate the effects of a cardio workout. Running, riding a bike, or using an elliptical or stairclimber machine helps you trim the fat and get in shape. Strippers are constantly on the move, so anything that gets you moving fast is a good option. Various high intensity sports are a good alternative if cardio exercises bore you. Play basketball, racquetball, ultimate frisbee, or soccer for a great cardio workout."

      "content": "Reduce or eliminate your carbohydrate intake. Carbs are easy energy, but your body tends to store them. Eat few or no carbs, which include pasta, potatoes, breads, sugar, and white rice. If your diet is rich in carbohydrates, you'll never get a chance to reduce your body fat. [5] X Research source Eat \"clean\" carbohydrates such as fresh fruit and brown rice. Fruit also helps you replace sugary snacks while still getting the feeling of eating sweets. Carbs also tend to slow you down, so they make it harder to feel energized for your workouts. Proper nutrition is vital. If you’ve got a layer of fat because of what you eat, exercises alone won’t help you to get rid of it."

      "content": "Eat high-quality, lean protein. Fish, chicken, and unprocessed turkey are the best meats to eat. Avoid fatty red meat, and get lean cuts if you do eat red meat. Nuts and seeds are good proteins for snacks. Also stick to low-fat or nonfat dairy products. [6] X Research source Eggs and peanut butter are great sources of protein, but remember they are high in fat. Eating just the egg whites reduces the fat, and some stores sell lower fat peanut butter."

      "content": "Eat leafy greens to get fiber. Digestion requires fiber, so make sure you’re getting enough each day. Kale, collard greens, and spinach are common leafy greens. Add these into salads and other dishes, or cook them and eat them alone. Broccoli and cauliflower are fiber-rich vegetables, too. Oats, seeds, and beans are good sources of fiber, as well. Fiber comes from many other sources, too, but they may be higher in fat content."

      "content": "Drink only water. If you really want to slim down and be in great shape, cut out all sugary drinks from your diet. Unsweetened tea and coffee are fine on occasion, as well as fat-free milk, but make sure most of your liquid intake is water. [7] X Research source You’ll be working out a lot to get a stripper’s body, which makes you lose water through sweat. You’ll need to increase your water intake as you sweat more. Drink a big glass of water before meals to feel full faster. Also be sure to drink extra water right after a workout to help avoid cramps in your muscles."

      "content": "Keep your body hair to a minimum. Look your body over to see how much hair you have. If you don’t grow much, you won’t need to worry. If you have a hairy chest, stomach, and back, you’ll need more work. You may need to trim or shave daily to keep the hair growth in check. The pubic area is another spot which requires grooming. How much hair you trim is up to you, but male strippers typically have little to no pubic hair."

      "content": "Use an electric trimmer to cut hair down close to the skin. If you don’t have an electric trimmer, it’s time to invest in one. Choose one with plenty of guards for various hair lengths. Use this on your torso and pubic area to trim long hair down to a point where it can be shaved when necessary. Always be careful when trimming, especially around your pubic region. Electric trimmers can pinch your skin if you aren’t careful."

      "content": "Choose a trimmer guard that's 1/4 in (6.5 mm) or less. There’s no hard and fast rule about how long body hair should be. The main thing is that trimming is almost always preferable to the natural look. To get the shortest possible length a trimmer offers, don’t use any guard. Find the right length depending on how much hair you have. If you have thick hair across your entire torso, the shortest length is probably best. If you aren't comfortable trimming your body hair this short, the stripper look might not be for you."

      "content": "Grab a sharp razor when you want to shave your skin clean. Always use creamy shave lotion to avoid razor burn when you shave. Make sure your razor stays sharp to get a clean shave. Dull blades pull at the hairs and irritate your skin. Be extra careful so you don’t nick your skin. Whether or not you should shave yourself down to the skin is both a personal preference and up to your boss, if you have one. Apply a hot towel to your skin before you shave to open the pores and raise the hairs."

      "content": "Shave or trim your hair regularly. Body hair grooming is an ongoing process if you want to maintain the look of a male stripper. Trim hair weekly, as a minimum, but shave daily if you want to keep your body looking clean and smooth. Keep in mind that once you shave a portion of skin completely, you’ll have to continue to shave or the hair will grow back thicker. It will also itch once it starts getting long again."
