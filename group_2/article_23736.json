      "title": "Avoid downloading more than one item at once.",
      "content": "Avoid downloading more than one item at once. As with any console, downloading multiple items at once will slow down the collective download speed for all items. You will achieve the best results by downloading items—particularly games—one at a time."

      "title": "Don't play online while your download is active.",
      "content": "Don't play online while your download is active. Not only will playing online during an active download hinder your online experience due to lag, it will also slow down the item's download speed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pause and then resume your download.",
      "content": "Pause and then resume your download. This is the download equivalent of turning off your computer and then turning it back on. If your download is taking a long time to initiate or proceed, pausing and then resuming it may increase the download speed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the terms of your Internet contract.",
      "content": "Check the terms of your Internet contract. The problem may be with your Internet service, not the console itself; for example, if you aren't approved for download speeds above a certain capacity (e.g., 25 Mbps), your downloads may not get any faster than they already are. Keep in mind that Internet speed is often measured in mega bits per second, not mega bytes per second. There are eight megabits in a megabyte, so a 25 Mbps connection is only allowing you to download ~3 megabytes per second. Upgrading your plan or switching to a better Internet Service Provider will most likely fix any capacity problems."

      "title": "Check the limitations of your modem and router.",
      "content": "Check the limitations of your modem and router. Cheap modems and routers tend to distribute limited amounts of bandwidth; just because you're paying for a certain download speed doesn't mean you're getting it. If your modem supports less bandwidth than does your Internet service, consider upgrading your equipment. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure your Wi-Fi network isn't crowded.",
      "content": "Make sure your Wi-Fi network isn't crowded. If you're trying to download something on the same network as another device—be it a computer, a phone, or a console—your download speed will slow down as a result. To solve this problem, try downloading when there's no one else in the house and no extra Internet items on your network."

    {
      "title": "Use an Ethernet connection",
      "content": "Use an Ethernet connection . While the PS4 has a competent wireless Internet receiver, plugging your console directly into your router or modem will always increase your Internet connection speed. You'll need an Ethernet cable to do so. One end of your Ethernet cable should plug into the square port in the back of your PS4 while the other plugs into a similar port marked \"Internet\" on your modem or router. Ethernet cable ends are interchangeable."
