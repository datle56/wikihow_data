      "title": "Slice the meat thinly.",
      "content": "Slice the meat thinly. You should cut the pork shoulder or pork loin into 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm)-thick slices. You can go even thinner and cut it into 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.3 cm)-thick pieces if you want it to be extra thin. Make sure to remove all of the bone. If you want to make it easier for yourself to slice the pieces, you can throw them in the freezer first until they start to firm up a bit, and then cut them."

      "title": "Create the curing mixture.",
      "content": "Create the curing mixture. You should mix the table salt, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, onion powder, and food coloring together until you've thoroughly combined the ingredients. Instead of the food coloring, you can use a teaspoon of red beet powder if you'd like. Place the ingredients in a bowl so you can easily rub the pork in the mixture. For a more tart flavor, you can add 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to the mixture."

      "title": "Refrigerate the pork for three days.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the pork for three days. Place the pork in a zip-seal bag or a closed plastic container and place it in the fridge for three days. This will ensure that the pork is fully cured before you cook it. When you take the pork out of the fridge, don't be disappointed if it doesn't have the bright, vibrant color you expected; it may look a bit gray and drab, but the colors will come out as you cook it."

      "title": "Pan-fry the pork.",
      "content": "Pan-fry the pork. Here's what you should do to pan fry the cured pork: Place the cured pork meat into a frying pan with a little bit of oil. Heat up the oil over medium-to-high heat and then heat each of the pieces for two to three minutes per side. Think of it as cooking bacon: just fry each piece until it is a nice crispy golden brown. When you're done frying each piece, just put it on a plate and move on to the next piece or pieces. You can even place the pieces on a paper towel if you want to soak up some of the grease first. If you want a more Caribbean flavor, you should cut up the pork into little squares and then fry it until its crunchy, serving it with white rice in a traditional dish called arroz blanco con tocino or \"white rice with tocino.\""

      "title": "Grill the pork.",

Here's what you can do to grill your tocino to perfection: Simply heat up the grill and place each piece of pork on it for two to three minutes on each side, just as you would in a frying pan. When each piece is crunchy and charred, remove it from the grill and you're all done. Wait for the pork to rest for about five minutes before you serve it."
