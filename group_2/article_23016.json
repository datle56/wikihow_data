      "content": "Give it a few more days if you want extra time to think. Waiting tells the other person that you're not sure about a relationship. After the first date, this is perfectly acceptable. The second date should be a continuation of getting to know each other. You can wait to ask or just wait to hear from the other person. [5] X Research source If you're waiting a few days, you might assume that their lives have gotten busy or maybe you've gotten sidetracked by your own projects and lost track of time. A little space between your first and second dates shouldn't be a big deal."

If it's been a week or two and you're still interested, it's fine to reach out to the other person, but they may not be as keen on a second date if it's taken so long to connect. Sometimes, there are perfectly good reasons why someone doesn't call or text after a first date—maybe there was a family emergency or they were dealing with an injury. By reaching out, you at least give them the chance to explain. You might realize that you're no longer interested in waiting and that's totally fine! If you haven't heard anything in a week or two, you probably want to move on."

If you know you want to see them again and you're ready to ask them out, think of a good date idea or two and see which one they prefer. If you make actual plans, you're more likely to go on the date than if you call and vaguely suggest that you hang out some time. [7] X Research source For example, instead of saying, \"I had fun the other night. We should do that again sometime,\" say, \"The other night was fun. What do you say we go out this weekend and hit the arcade?\" Although you can text them to ask for a second date, calling them really signals your interest better."

Make it clear when you're free for a second date, so you don't leave the other person wondering about whether or not you're interested. For instance, if you went out for dinner one weeknight, you might not be free until the following weekend. Ask the other what their schedule looks like for the next few days or week when you're discussing a second date. You might say, \"How does your weekend look?\" or, \"Are you free to get dinner together sometime this week?\""

[8] X Research source It's not the end of the world if some of the spark has gone out—it just means that you'll have to reconnect with them on the second date.
