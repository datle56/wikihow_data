      "title": "Brush your teeth or chew some minty gum.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth or chew some minty gum. It always helps to be prepared when you’re trying to kiss someone. Before you try anything, head to the bathroom and brush your teeth or suck on a mint, especially if you just ate lunch. [1] X Research source Try not to eat anything too smelly, like garlic or onions, before you want to kiss someone."

      "title": "She might not want an audience around when you two kiss.",
      "content": "She might not want an audience around when you two kiss. If you’re hanging at school with your friends or around teachers, stick with a nice kiss on the cheek. It’s a sweet, yet respectful gesture that she’ll probably appreciate. [2] X Research source You could also kiss her on the forehead or even on the hand for a bit of romance."
    },
    {
      "title": "You can greet each other or say goodbye with a kiss.",
      "content": "You can greet each other or say goodbye with a kiss. If you two are in a relationship, giving each other a quick kiss on the lips is no big deal. If you pass by each other in the halls or see each other during passing time, pull her in and give her a smooch before heading on your way. [3] X Research source This isn’t a great plan for a first kiss, so save this one for when you’re a little more comfortable with each other."
    },
    {
      "title": "Head somewhere secluded where the teaching staff won’t see you.",
      "content": "Head somewhere secluded where the teaching staff won’t see you. You can stay on campus, but try to go somewhere far away from other students and teachers. This isn’t a great spot for making out, but you can catch a few minutes of privacy to kiss and talk a little. [4] X Research source You could also sit under the bleachers for extra privacy."
    },
    {
      "title": "If you have some free time, break away from your friend group for a bit.",
      "content": "If you have some free time, break away from your friend group for a bit. You two can walk around, talk, and even share a quick kiss before you both head off to class. Just remember to listen for the bell! [5] X Research source The back of your building shouldn’t be too populated, especially first thing in the morning."
    },
    {
      "title": "This one takes a little coordination, but it’s worth it!",
      "content": "This one takes a little coordination, but it’s worth it! If you’re in separate classes, plan to take a bathroom break at the same time. Then, hang out in a hallway where you know you won’t get caught (watch out for teachers and hall monitors). You can give each other a quick peck before you head on back to class. [6] X Research source For instance, you might plan to take a bathroom break at exactly 1:15."

    {
      "title": "School dances can be super romantic.",
      "content": "School dances can be super romantic. If you two are slow dancing together and the moment feels right, give her a quick kiss on the lips. Keep this one super short, as your chaperones probably won’t appreciate anything longer than a few seconds. [7] X Research source This is especially fun during a formal school dance like prom or homecoming."

    {
      "title": "School isn’t the best spot for a makeout session.",
      "content": "School isn’t the best spot for a makeout session. Even if you’re fairly secluded, there’s always a chance that a teacher or a fellow student could walk up on you. Save the heavier stuff for when you two are alone. [8] X Research source Depending on your school’s policy, you might even get in trouble for taking it further than a quick kiss."
    },
    {
      "title": "There’s no way to be sure unless you ask directly.",
      "content": "There’s no way to be sure unless you ask directly. If you’re uncertain as to whether or not she wants to kiss you, just ask! You can do it in a sweet way that’s not awkward. Try something like: [9] X Research source “Would it be okay if I kissed you?” “Can I kiss you?” “I’d love to kiss you right now.”"
