Make and place a batter board at each end of your fence. If your fence has corners, place them there too. Then, connect the batter boards with string to outline the area of your fence. [2] X Research source The string provides a guideline for your posts and ensures that they’re installed straight when you put them in the ground. Using a batter board allows you to move the string across the wood piece to adjust your fence guideline. If you don’t want to make batter boards, just use stakes to mark the corners."

Fence posts are typically spaced 5 to 8 feet (1.5-2.4 m) away from each other, though that depends on your city’s regulations and the type of fence you’re building.

Both heartwood and pressure-treated wood make durable fence posts, so look up your area’s building guidelines or codes to see what specific lumber they recommend. Regardless of the type of wood you use, only buy lumber that’s labeled as suitable for ground contact. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source Unless you live in a desert, choose durable lumber for your posts, like: Durable heartwood: Western juniper, black locust, and Osage-orange are excellent lumber choices. Pacific yew, redwood, and most cedar and white oak species often last 20+ years in most conditions. [5] X Research source Pressure-treated wood: choose a variety with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of sapwood surrounding a core of heartwood. Aspen, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and Douglas fir are great options. Just buy this wood from a trusted source to avoid poorly treated wood."

      "content": "Coat the posts with wood preservative to protect them against moisture. While this step is optional, it helps your wood posts stay sturdy for longer. The sawn-off ends of fence posts are often vulnerable to moisture. If you live in a damp climate or want to take some extra precautions, follow these steps to protect your wood: Use a saw or sliding bevel to cut the top of the fence post at a 45º angle, which encourages rain runoff. Or, install post caps on the posts once they’re in the ground. [6] X Research source Treat each end of the wood with a non-water-based, brush-on wood preservative , such as copper naphthenate. Wood preservative is toxic, so follow the safety recommendations on the label when you apply it. Apply multiple coats of the copper naphthenate, letting each coat dry for 24 hours."

      "content": "Use soil or gravel to set your fence post if you have dense soil. Install your posts directly into the soil as long as it's dense and has good drainage. Installation is typically more labor-intensive and a bit less stable than concrete, but it’s often cheaper and makes your wood more resistant to decay. [7] X Research source Loamy soil, which has an even mixture of sand, silt, and clay, is generally dense and has good drainage. Soil that is mostly sand or clay tends to have poor drainage. [8] X Research source Dig a hole 12 inches (30 cm) deep and 4-12 inches (10-30 cm) wide to check your soil drainage. Fill the hole with water and wait for it to drain. Then, fill it with water again. Measure the water depth, wait 15 minutes, and measure again. Multiply the measurement by 4 to find how fast the water drains per hour. If it’s less than 1 inch (2.5 cm), your soil has poor drainage. [9] X Research source Due to additional strain, gate posts work better when installed in concrete."

For example, if you have an 8-foot (2.4 m) post, make a hole at least 2 feet (0.6 m) deep. When anchoring the post in soil, dig the hole about as wide as the fence post. If you’re anchoring the post in gravel, dig a hole about 8 inches (20 cm) across for a standard 4x4 post. [10] X Research source If your soil is hard, cut through the sod with a shovel and soak the ground with water. Keep some dirt, or dirt mixed with gravel, nearby to backfill the hole."

It can also improve the stability of your posts if it’s well-tamped and installed in dense soil. Whether you’re using crushed stone or soil, shovel it in 3–5 inches (7.5–12.5cm) at a time, tamping well after each batch. Repeat until the hole is filled. Before each tamping, hold a level against the post and adjust it if it isn’t level. If you want to plant grass at the base of the post, use soil for the last 2-3 inches (5-8 cm)."

The main downside to using concrete is that it can trap water around the post. This sometimes reduces the lifespan of your posts by many years. However, adding a gravel base and an open-bottomed concrete sleeve helps mitigate this issue. If you’re adding a gate post, be sure to use concrete."

Check the consistency and slowly add more water until the concrete feels like paste. [15] X Research source Add the water in small increments to ensure the concrete doesn’t come out too runny. When it’s a good consistency, the concrete falls off of the shovel easily. To save effort, rent a portable concrete mixer or a concrete truck. To save money, make your own concrete mix. Mix together 1 part Portland cement, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts coarse gravel, by volume. [16] X Research source For a quicker solution, use fast-setting concrete . With this type of concrete, you pour the dry mixture into the hole, then add in water. These mixes tend to be weaker and more expensive, so use them with your own caution. [17] X Research source"
