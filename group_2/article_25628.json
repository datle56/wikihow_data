      "content": "LARP stands for “live-action role-playing game.” A LARP is a type of role-playing game where players dress up as characters in a fictional world, create a plot or conflict, and act out their actions using props. Lots of LARPs are fantasy or medieval-based adventures. However, LARPs can be of any genre, like sci-fi, western, historical fiction, or supernatural. [1] X Research source Someone who plays LARPs is called a LARPer. LARP can also be used as a verb to mean “to participate in a live-action role-playing game.” So, you can say that someone is LARPing or LARPed. For instance, players might role-play as characters in The Lord of the Rings and act out battles using foam or plastic weapons. Or, they might role-play as vampires fighting for control of the coven. People can make up their own LARPs and characters, or play in other people’s games and get assigned characters. The game can be free-flowing or have set plot points that a game master orchestrates."

My character is an alien who crash-landed on the planet, so they’re looking for a way back home.” “We went LARPing at the Renaissance Faire this weekend! It was so fun to dress up as a woodland elf and do a treasure-hunt adventure.” “Oh, I’m a big LARPer! My favorite LARP is a post-apocalyptic survival game where I’m a zombie.” I went to the LARP fest last year and it was so fun! I joined 3 different LARPs which were all great, but my favorite was the murder mystery set in a haunted mansion.”"

      "content": "LARPs were inspired by tabletop role-playing games (RPGs). In a tabletop RPG, players sit around a table and verbally play as an assigned character. A game master usually creates a story and describes the plot and characters to the players. The players typically use dice to make decisions and the game master tells them how their decisions affect the story. [2] X Research source The first and most famous tabletop RPG is Dungeons & Dragons , which was created in 1974. Tabletop RPGs were likely influenced by strategy games and murder mystery games, which have role-playing elements. [3] X Research source Tabletop RPGs led to the creation of video game RPGs, such as single-player games like Baldur’s Gate and massive multiplayer online games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft ."

Tolkien’s world of Middle Earth and medieval history. Players dress in fantasy or medieval-influenced clothing and fight each other with fake, harmless weapons. [4] X Research source The history of LARPing is hard to trace, as it’s a form of playing make-believe, which people have been doing for centuries. However, Dagorhir is considered the oldest formal example of LARPing."

LARPs that use boffers are called boffer LARPs and are often combat-based. LARPs that don’t use boffers are called non-boffer LARPs—they might use plastic weapons instead or not be combat-based."
