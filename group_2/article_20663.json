      "content": "If there's a grace period, you can cancel without issue. If you’ve just signed up for a plan and have instant buyer’s remorse, don’t wait to take action. You probably have a grace period within which you can cancel the agreement. For example, if you want to get out of your Verizon contract, you can do so without penalty within the first 30 days of service. [1] X Research source Determine if there’s a particular method that you have to use to take advantage of the grace period cancellation provision. See if merely speaking with a customer service representative is enough or if you have to submit a request in writing. If you haven’t bought your phone outright from the carrier, they will want it back. You may be assessed a restocking fee."

      "content": "Research competing major cellphone plan carriers. Once you’ve figured out what your ETF is, research other major carriers, like T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&T, to see if they are offering deals to pay off your contract with your previous provider. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that if you're financing your phone, your new carrier will likely not cover that remaining balance. Some smaller local carriers may offer to help you get out of your phone contract, but this is not as common as with larger cellular carriers."

      "title": "Your Early Termination Fee (ETF) may be less than you think.",
      "content": "Your Early Termination Fee (ETF) may be less than you think. One of the reasons people don’t leave a carrier they’re unhappy with is the dreaded ETF. However, carriers prorate their ETFs based on the amount owed on the time remaining in your contract. Depending on how long you've been in your contract, the ETF could be pretty small. Call your carrier to determine the amount you’d be liable for if you terminate your agreement. [3] X Research source You can also look here for an ETF calculator. You may need to notify your carrier of this decision in writing, though some carriers allow you to do so over the phone. If you call, a customer service representative may try to convince you to stay with the company. Maybe they’ll offer you an incentive to stay, like a phone upgrade, even if you’re not due for one. If an incentive doesn’t do it for you, find out how the ETF will be paid, cancel, and bid the carrier farewell. If you own your phone outright, consider selling it to cover the cost of the ETF. You’re probably planning on moving to a new carrier and taking advantage of one of their phone offers. Companies like Gazelle.com can make the selling process easy."

      "content": "Determine if modifications were made to the original contract terms. If you don’t have a copy of your cellphone plan agreement, contact your carrier for a copy. Here’s where you could find a possible escape route. You must note any changes as soon as they occur. If the contract makes no reference to future modifications, and the carrier modified your agreement terms during the contract period, you could claim a breach of the agreement. However, be aware that many contracts have a provision that says the carrier can change the agreement at any time. Even if the contract contains a term addressing future modifications, you may be able to break the contract if the change is “materially adverse” to you, such as a rate or fee increase.

Complaints such as continuous dropped calls and chronic poor reception are legitimate reasons for getting out of your contract without paying an ETF. If poor service is your main complaint, keep a log of everything that goes wrong. Collect your data over a week or two, and have it available when you speak with the customer service representative.

      "content": "In some cases, a manager may cut you some slack. Managers have more authority when deciding on terminating the contract, and some may be compassionate enough to do so even when your contract technically doesn't offer such concessions. Some excuses a manager may consider a suitable reason to let you out of your contract: Death. If the actual contract holder has died, you can contact the carrier to cancel the contract. You will need to provide some sort of proof that the person has died, so faking your death won't work. [6] X Research source A change in financial situation. While it's rare to get a break on your contract for this reason, some companies may be more lenient than others, or they may offer to reduce your remaining payments or early termination fees. Divorce. If you are divorcing the person with whom you share a contract, a manager can usually help you terminate the contract. Legal issues. Some legal issues may help you get out of your phone contract, especially if you have a police report or proof of incarceration."

If you're moving out of the country or just to a rural area with no coverage, you can get out of your phone contract by providing customer service with proof that the move is out of your control. Some situations that might work in your favor: Military reassignment. If you're a service member being relocated to a place where your phone plan isn't supported, and you'll be at the new location for 90 days or more, your carrier cannot legally charge you an early termination fee.

Let your carrier know that you’d like to transfer your plan to someone else, and find out what’s needed to put that into effect. You may be told that this can be done with what’s known as an Assumption of Liability. This is a transaction that legally transfers your existing contract to another person. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Your carrier will most likely instruct the person taking over your plan to read and agree to abide by the carrier’s Terms and Conditions of Agreement. Your carrier may also have an Assumption of Liability form, which you and the person taking over the contract will probably need to sign.

If you’re not having any success finding someone to buy your plan, you might want to look into swapping plans, in which case you literally switch your plan with someone else’s.

If you search, you’ll find some companies willing to assist you. However, you'll likely have to pay a fee for the service. Do your homework on the company you’re thinking of using. Ask around to see if anyone you know has used it before. You can also do a BBB search to see if it is listed there and its rating."
