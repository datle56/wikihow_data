      "content": "Make sure that your shoes have nothing on them. If you have polished them before, give them a quick sanding with some fine sandpaper. Make sure they are clean as well. Polishing your shoes is kind of like waxing a car. Just like you wouldn't wax a dirty car, you also wouldn't polish a pair of dirty shoes. Saddle soap works well for cleaning shoes, but you can use baby shampoo and a little bit of water if you're in a pinchâ€”just make sure that the water doesn't soak in."

Once there is no sign of the matt polish, you should get your soft cloth, ideally a microfibre cloth used for cleaning glasses, holding the shoe tight, and buff up the nose really hard and quickly, drying it and giving it that mirror shine.
