      "content": "Practice the mechanic’s grip to learn the standard way to handle the deck. Understanding the mechanic’s grip will help you to build a solid foundation for learning cardistry skills and maneuvers. Hold the deck vertically in your palm, with your thumb positioned down 1 long edge. Place your index finger along the top short edge and wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the other long edge of the deck. [1] X Research source Make sure that there is a gap between your palm and the deck as you hold it. The deck should be supported by your fingers and not resting flat in your palm. The mechanic’s grip is the default position for holding a deck of cards. This is also the easiest grip to perform in cardistry. The mechanic’s grip is also known as the dealer’s grip."

The straddle grip is a basic grip that you’ll need to learn before you can move onto more complex cardistry techniques. Place the deck vertically in your hand with your index and pinky fingers supporting the short edges of the deck. Remove your thumb from the deck and support the long edge using your middle and ring fingers. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try the pivot for an easy way to rotate a card. Hold the deck of cards horizontally with your thumb at 1 short edge and your middle finger at the other short edge. Position your index finger on the deck of cards, approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) away from your middle finger. Then use your index finger to push the front card against your middle finger so that the card rotates clockwise by 45°. [3] X Research source Try to pivot the card so that it turns outward rather than upward. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn the angle move to pick up 1 card with 1 finger. Use your thumb to push only the top card towards your middle finger and then use your middle finger to apply pressure to the center of the card on the other side. Quickly extend your thumb upward so that the card sticks to your thumb and moves upward, separating from the deck and losing contact with your middle finger. [5] X Research source To position the cards at the beginning, hold the deck vertically in your palm with your thumb wrapping around 1 long edge and your middle, ring, and pinky fingers wrapping around the other long edge. The card ends up balanced on your thumb, not touching the deck. During this move, position your middle finger in the center of the card and your thumb just off the center. If your hands feel quite dry, rub your thumb and middle finger together so that the card can stick more easily to your thumb."

      "content": "Try the 100 fan move to learn a beginner fan maneuver. Position your thumb in the bottom, right-hand corner, close to your pinky finger. Apply pressure to the deck with your thumb and then move your thumb upward toward your index finger to spread the cards into a fan shape. Support the back of the deck with your index and middle fingers while it’s fanned. [6] X Research source Start the 100 fan move by taking half of the deck and hold it horizontally away from your palm. Support 1 short edge with your middle and ring fingers, and 1 long edge with your index and pinky fingers. The 100 fan move is easiest to do with a brand new deck. When the cards are fanned, keep them supported using just your thumb and index fingers. You can spread your middle, ring, and pinky fingers outward and away from the deck."

      "content": "Perform the Sybil cut to do a fancy, advanced flourish. Make a \"Z\" formation first to create 3 sections. Then split the third section of cards in half to create the fourth section. Swing the third section of cards downward, bringing it under the second section to join the first, to form 3 sections again. Then repeat this sequence again to complete the Sybil cut. [7] X Research source To make the \"Z\" formation, hold the deck in 1 hand and use your other hand to lift half of it up at 1 short edge so that it looks like a \"<\" shape. Then repeat the process with the top half of the deck while leaving a few cards positioned diagonally across the center to connect 2 halves, making a \"Z\" shape. [8] X Research source To break the deck into 4 sections, keep the second and third sections connected with your thumb and use your index finger to lift the top, short edge of the third section to make the fourth section. Let the first section relax in your palm. [9] X Research source To swing the third section of cards downward, keep the second, third, and fourth sections connected with your thumb and turn your wrist down. Aim for the first and second sections to remain upright and for the third and fourth sections to rotate upside down. [10] X Research source The top card of the deck remains the same as you perform the Sybil cut. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Start practicing with a cardistry trainer deck. It can be easier to use a trainer deck while you’re getting used to handling the cards, as there are far fewer cards to pick up if you drop the deck. Purchase a cardistry trainer deck online from a specialty cardistry store. Then use it to practice different grips and cuts if using a real deck is too difficult when you first begin. [12] X Research source A cardistry trainer deck is made up of approximately 9 pieces of thick plastic. This means that if you drop the deck, you don’t have to worry about picking up 52 individual cards. A trainer deck is the same size as a regular deck of cards. Cardistry trainer decks are also very durable, so you don’t need to worry about bending or breaking them."

      "content": "Get several decks of cheap cards when you feel more confident. Once you've moved on from a trainer deck, you need plenty of cards to practice with. Purchase several decks of cards from a department or toy store and practice as much as you can. Don’t worry if the cards bend or get damaged, as this is inevitable while you’re learning. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that new decks of cards can be slippery, so it's easy to drop or lose them. If you have older decks of cards, use these first."

Practice along with the video using your own deck of cards and don’t be afraid to pause or rewind the video so that you can learn at the right pace for you. [14] X Research source Cardistry is all about practice and there are plenty of videos available online to help you develop your skills. The majority of cardistry videos online are freely available."

Practice as much as possible so that you can develop your cardistry skills and gain confidence. Good moments to practice include while you’re watching TV, when you're on public transport, or whenever you have a spare moment. [15] X Research source Cardistry can be a difficult art form to learn, so don’t worry if it takes a while to learn each new trick. Take a break if you’re feeling frustrated. Cardistry can be complicated to learn at times, so it's best to simply take your time and don’t push yourself to learn new skills quickly. Take your time and focus on having fun! [16] X Research source Popular cardistry tricks to try out include the spring, the thumb fan, the scissor cut, and the WERM. [17] X Research source"
