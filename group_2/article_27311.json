      "content": "Cut up a glue stick and put it into a bowl. Unscrew a glue stick and pull it out of the tube. Slice the glue into small pieces, then toss them into a bowl. The size of the pieces does not matter; this is just to help the glue dissolve faster later on. [1] X Research source You will be heating this bowl in the microwave, so make sure that it is microwave-safe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the glue stick with a splash of water.",
      "content": "Cover the glue stick with a splash of water. The exact amount does not matter, since it’s mostly there to prevent the glue stick from drying out in the next step. Remember, you can always add more water later. [2] X Research source Don’t worry about dissolving the glue in the water here."
    },
    {
      "title": "Microwave the glue",
      "content": "Microwave the glue for about 50 seconds. If you have a powerful microwave, reduce the time to about 35 seconds instead. You want to heat the glue long enough for it to dissolve. [3] X Research source If the glue didn't completely dissolve, give it a stir first. Sometimes, this is all you need to help the glue finish melting. If that doesn't help the glue dissolve further, microwave it at 10 to 15-second intervals until it does. Be sure to stir after each interval!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 1 to 3 drops of food coloring, then stir the mixture.",
      "content": "Add 1 to 3 drops of food coloring, then stir the mixture. Give the glue a brief stir first, so that the texture is consistent. Next, add in a few drops of food coloring, then stir the mixture again until the color and texture are even. [4] X Research source The more food coloring you add, the darker the color will be. Start with 1 to 3 drops, then add more, if needed. If you want white-colored slime, skip the food coloring."

    {
      "title": "Freeze the slime for 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Freeze the slime for 10 to 15 minutes. This is where the magic happens! As you freeze the slime, it will turn from a liquid to a semi-solid. Simply put the bowl into the freezer, and set the timer for 10 to 15 minutes. [5] X Research source If the bowl is made from glass, make sure that it is freezer-safe. Let the bowl cool down to room-temperature before you freeze it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the slime for 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Knead the slime for 2 to 3 minutes. After you freeze the slime, it should already have a putty-like consistency. The more you knead it, however, the more firm it will become. Simply take it out of the bowl and squish it with your fingers for about 2 to 3 minutes. [6] X Research source This slime will be the most gooey out of the other recipes here. It is oozy, and not very stretchy."

Make sure that the bowl is microwave-safe. [7] X Research source The size of the pieces does not matter. This is just to help the glue melt faster. You'll be heating this in the microwave, so make sure that the bowl isn't made from metal!"

      "title": "Pour enough water into the bowl to cover the glue stick pieces.",
      "content": "Pour enough water into the bowl to cover the glue stick pieces. The exact amount of water does not matter, but about 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 mL) should be plenty. The water is mostly there to prevent the glue from drying out when you heat it. [8] X Research source Give the glue a brief stir to ensure that everything gets submerged."

      "content": "Stir in a few drops of food coloring, if desired. Keep in mind that the slime will also take on the color of the laundry detergent. For example, if you added yellow food coloring and plan to use blue laundry detergent, the resulting slime will be greenish! [10] X Research source Start with 1 to 3 drops of food coloring. The more you add, the darker the color will be!"

      "title": "Add a splash of liquid laundry detergent.",
      "content": "Add a splash of liquid laundry detergent. If you like the color of your slime, use clear laundry detergent. If you are feeling more adventurous, however, you can try a colored detergent instead. [11] X Research source There is no precise measurement for this, but it would be best to start with just 1 tablespoon (15 mL). You can always add more later. Do not use powdered laundry detergent. It is not the same thing. You can try using liquid starch, but your slime may not have the same results."

      "content": "Stir the glue until it turns slimy, adding more detergent as needed. The longer you stir the solution, the more gooey it will become. You will probably end up stirring it for 1 to 2 minutes. [12] X Research source If the slime is too runny, add a little bit more laundry detergent. Take it easy here, since a little bit goes a long way."

      "content": "Knead the slime for about 2 to 3 minutes. Once the ingredients have come together and formed a slime, pull the putty from the bowl, and squish it between your fingers for a few minutes. This will help make the slime a little more firm. [13] X Research source This slime will be a little more firm than the kind made from just water and glue sticks."

The size of the pieces does not matter, but the smaller they are, the faster they will dissolve. [14] X Research source You won’t be using the microwave in this recipe, so you can use any type of bowl you want."

      "content": "Wait 1 minute for the glue to dissolve, then stir it again. Depending on the size of the glue stick, it may take a little longer than 1 minute. You are simply looking for the glue to dissolve and turn milky. [16] X Research source There may still be some oatmeal-sized chunks of glue, which is fine. You’ll knead these out later."

A little bit goes a long way, so you only need 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL). Remember, you can always add more contact lens solution later.

      "content": "Knead the slime for a few minutes, focusing on the chunks. Depending on how many chunks there are, this can take anywhere from 2 to 3 minutes. The more you knead the slime, the more putty-like it will become. As you knead it, press those little chunks of glue between your fingers. [20] X Research source You may not be able to get all of the chunks out; just try to squish them out as best as you can. When finished, this slime will be more like silly putty than traditional gak slime."
