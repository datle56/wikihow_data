      "title": "Create a triangular base by sticking 3 skewers into 3 marshmallows.",
      "content": "Create a triangular base by sticking 3 skewers into 3 marshmallows. Lay out 3 skewers so they form an equilateral triangle on a flat surface. Connect the skewers at each corner with a single marshmallow. Standard-sized marshmallows will work best but you can use mini or jumbo marshmallows too. [1] X Research source When you push the skewer into the marshmallow, don't push it through the other side. About halfway through should do. You can secure the skewers to the marshmallows using painter's tape if you need to. Wrap the tape around the skewer and the point it enters the marshmallow. This will keep the skewers in place. When finished, the 3 marshmallows should form the 3 points of the triangle and the 3 skewers should be the 3 sides."

Bring all 3 of these skewers together in the center, pushing them all into 1 marshmallow, around halfway through. Where the 3 skewers meet the marshmallow is the peak of the pyramid. [2] X Research source Stick the 3 skewers into a marshmallow to hold them all together."

      "title": "Use tape or rubber bands to secure the peak of the pyramid in place.",
      "content": "Use tape or rubber bands to secure the peak of the pyramid in place. For extra security at the peak of the pyramid, use either tape or rubber bands to hold the skewers and marshmallow together so they don't come apart when you use the catapult. Wrap painter's tape around the marshmallow and top of the skewers to hold the parts together. [3] X Research source Wrap the rubber band around the skewers. With all the extra rubber band, twist it and wrap it over the skewers again. Keep twisting the excess rubber band until it's tightly wrapped around the skewers and the marshmallow."

The head of the spoon should extend past the skewer. Wrap the painter's tape around the skewer a few times to keep the spoon attached. This is the arm of the catapult. [4] X Research source"

With the rubber band attached to the peak of the pyramid, put the spoon and skewer through the center of it. Pick 1 of the 3 triangle points and push the skewer with the spoon into that marshmallow. [6] X Research source The skewer should sit below the peak and not off to 1 side. The bowl of the spoon should be facing upward so it can hold the marshmallow before you launch it. Use painter's tape or another rubber band to secure this skewer to the marshmallow you picked."

Make sure you don't pull too far back on the spoon when you're launching your marshmallow as you might break the skewer or the spoon. [7] X Research source Create a target on a wall using your painter's tape. You can fire mini, standard, or jumbo-sized marshmallows."

Pull the excess band away, twist it, and wrap it around the sticks again. Do the same at the other end of the bundle.

These 2 sticks will form the catapult part of your design.

The 7-stick bundle should be pointing North-West and the 2-stick bundle South-East.
