      "content": "Straighten out your bobby pin with your pliers. You want your bobby pin as straight as possible. This will help your fake braces look realistic. Use your pliers to form a straight line with your bobby pin. Then, use the pliers to smooth out any waves or wiggles in the pin. [3] X Research source Have patience . This can take quite awhile depending on how uneven your bobby pin is. The more straight you make your bobby pin, the more realistic your fake braces will look when you put them in your mouth."

      "content": "Wash and dry your bobby pin. Once the bobby pin has formed a straight line, wash the pin with antibacterial soap in warm water. As you'll be putting the bobby pin in your mouth, you want it to be clean. Pliers can be very dirty. Then, set the bobby pin aside until it's dry to the touch. Bobby pins are not very big, so this should not take too long. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Snap the earring backs onto the bobby pins so the flat backs are facing your teeth. Now you will need to add the earring backs to the bobby pin. Place about four earring backs along the bobby pin, so the flat backs of the earring backs are facing your teeth. You want to place the earring backs so each back fits over the front of one of your teeth. You may have to put the bobby pin in your mouth on occasion to gauge where to place the earring backs. This can take a long time, as earring backs may slip off easily. Be patient. Snap on the earring back at equal distances. [6] X Research source Butterfly earring backs have two small loops on the front. The idea is to push the bobby pin into the space between these loops. This can be difficult, so go slowly. Do not be surprised if the earring backs occasionally slip out of your hand. Four earring backs should be sufficient to create fake braces. However, if you have a wider mouth, you may need slightly more earring backs. You'll need enough earring backs to cover all your teeth when you smile."

Push one end of the band through a loop in the earring back. Then, move the silly band around the earring back and pull it through the other loop. Trim excess silly band and repeat the process with all the other earring backs. [8] X Research source You may have to trim down the end of a silly band with your scissors so it forms a point. This way, it'll be easier to slip through the earring loop. This step is optional. If you do not want colored braces, you can skip it."

It also provides a way to hinge the braces in your mouth. Your fake braces should look something like a \"D\" shape once you've looped the rubber band in place. [9] X Research source It's a good idea to secure the rubber band by bending both sharp ends of the bobby pins into a small loop. Not only does this keep the rubber band from moving, it eliminates some of the sharper aspects of the fake braces. You do not want anything too pointy in your mouth for long."
