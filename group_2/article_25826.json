      "content": "Having a conversation is better than leaving without a word. Unless you're in danger or feel unsafe, don't disappear into the night with your child. It's better to express your feelings and formally break up with your toxic partner face-to-face. Set boundaries with your toxic partner so they know what you expect moving forward. A toxic partner might try to guilt or shame you into staying, so make it very clear to them that your mind is made up. [2] X Research source Let trusted friends or family members know what you’re planning so they can support you. Ask them to check in with you after the conversation to make sure you’re safe. If your partner threatens to commit suicide or hurt you if you leave them, call emergency services immediately."

      "content": "Use age-appropriate language to explain the situation. Ideally, both parents will explain the breakup to the child as a united front, but that’s not always possible. The most important thing is to explain what's happening in a way that will make sense to your child. You don’t need to include a lot of detail at this point; just make it clear that you’re leaving and why. [4] X Research source If you have a small child, you might say, “Sometimes moms and dads stop loving each another. It's really sad when that happens, but I promise you it’s going to be okay, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now.” For an older child, you might say, “Your father and I don’t get along, so we aren’t going to live together anymore. But don’t worry, we both love you very much and you’re still going to see both of us.” As your child gets older, you can explain the breakup in more detail."

Regardless of your feelings towards your ex, your child still loves them and deserves to have a relationship with them.

Your child should be able to see their other parent as often as they like, provided they’ll be safe with them.

      "content": "Growing up in a toxic environment is very harmful for a child. It’s normal to feel guilty and worry whether you’re doing the right thing for your child. However, most experts agree that it’s better for children to grow up in a stable, single-parent home instead of living in a two-parent household full of conflict and negativity. You may have to remind yourself of this frequently, and that’s okay. [8] X Research source Experts believe that a couple’s irritation and anger at one another often spills over into their relationships with the kids. Start a journal or make a list of all the reasons why you're ending the relationship. That way, you'll always have reminders on hand. [9] X Research source"
