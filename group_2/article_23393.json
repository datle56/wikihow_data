      "title": "Look at the conformation.",
      "content": "Look at the conformation. Conformation means the physical appearance of the dog. Rottweilers have an overall stocky look, with a wide chest, long back, and thick legs. Typically they range from 2 to 2 1 ⁄ 2 feet (0.6 to 0.8 m) tall at the shoulder, though it is not uncommon for them to be even taller. Rottweilers are powerful, muscular dogs, and the overall shape of the animal should invoke a feeling of strength and agility. They have large, heavy paws with high knuckles, and are never flat-footed. Their legs are straight, not bowed outwards, and typically stand such that their shoulders are even with or slightly higher than their hindquarters. Their necks are thick, nearly the same diameter around as their heads. The tail is usually docked (cut short), but not always, so the presence of a long tail cannot automatically disqualify a Rottweiler from being a purebred Rottweiler."

      "title": "Look at the head.",
      "content": "Look at the head. Their heads are very boxy, being about the same height as width, and only slightly longer from nose to the back of the head. Rottweilers can have a slight wrinkling effect around the eyes, but this should not be too pronounced.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source The ears of a Rottweiler will always fold down with a triangular shape, similar to but smaller than a Labrador Retrievers , and they will never stand upright like a German Shepherd Dog or hang like a Basset Hound."

      "title": "Notice their jaw strength.",
      "content": "Notice their jaw strength. It is also important to note that, of the recognized breeds, Rottweilers are typically credited as having the second strongest bite pressure, behind only the pit bull , when measured in pounds per square inch. To this end, the jaws are robust and heavy, and the head wide in order to accommodate the large muscles needed to achieve this kind of strength. Rottweilers will never have underbites like English Bulldogs ."

      "title": "Recognize deviations among individuals.",
      "content": "Recognize deviations among individuals. Not every Rottweiler is a perfect specimen. Some may be stockier, longer, taller, leaner, or otherwise different than others of the same breed. Remember that while breed types are usually pretty all-inclusive, it is possible to have small variations, especially those that are environmental in nature, within the same breed. [2] X Research source It is also important to consider that, like people, some Rottweilers are overweight, and will resemble more of a barrel shape than a tapered athlete. This does not mean the dog is not a Rottweiler, just that it has been spoiled with food."

      "title": "Notice common personality traits.",
      "content": "Notice common personality traits. Rottweilers were initially bred for work as protectors and guardians. This means they can be quite dominant, and even aggressive on occasion. Rottweilers are intelligent and active dogs who enjoy playing and completing tasks. As long as you give them a comfortable and loving environment, Rottweilers won't be aggressive. [3] X Research source Rottweilers can be very gentle and loving dogs, but they require a lot of training and guidance from an early age. Without proper training as a puppy, Rottweilers can become destructive pets who bark constantly and chew up your furniture or dig in the yard."

    {
      "title": "Look at the coloring.",
      "content": "Look at the coloring. All Rottweilers have a black base coat on their bodies with distinctive tan markings on their chests, legs, and face. The tan can be a range of colors from a dark mahogany to a red or rusty color, but the black will always be black, never grey or merle, (a mix of colors.) The brown is typically isolated to the dog's paws, the insides of its legs, its chest, its throat and muzzle, and two distinct dots above the eyes. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source This pattern is so unique to the breed that it is simply called \"Rottweiler color,\" even when found on mixed breed dogs. The only other breed to have this coloration naturally is the Doberman Pinscher, which also originated in Germany, but the Doberman Pinscher is very lean, long, and tall, as it was bred for running more than for fighting and intimidation. The Australian Kelpie has very similar markings, but as with the Doberman Pinscher, it is more elongated with its features and more athletic in its activity and prowess."

    {
      "title": "Notice the variations in the markings.",
      "content": "Notice the variations in the markings. The actual size and shape of the markings may vary between individual dogs. For example, some dogs may have an upside-down wishbone-shaped brown mark on their chests, while others may have a butterfly shape, two separate dots on each pectoral (chest muscle), or just a shapeless smudge. The important thing to remember is the overall positioning of the markings. [5] X Research source Some dogs may also have white markings on them. This is considered a fault by the breed standards, but nonetheless some purebred Rottweilers may have white on the chest, between the shoulders, or on the face or paws. Sometimes older dogs will develop white in these areas as well. In these cases, the white is not a fault, but simply an effect of aging. The white on older Rottweilers will typically look more grizzled than pure white, however."

      "title": "Acknowledge rare colorations.",
      "content": "Acknowledge rare colorations. Rarely, Rottweilers can be born albino, all red, or with a \"bluish\" color. These are considered breed faults, but are not predictable. Albino Rottweilers are all white with pink skin and red eyes, but otherwise conform to the breed's physical characteristics. Keep in mind that these are rare mutations, and a red or blue Rottweiler is most likely a mix. [6] X Research source A red Rottweiler conforms to all the breed's physical standards, but is all brown or red instead of having the typical black and red coloration. A Rottweiler is said to be \"blue\" when the guard hairs of the coat are a lighter color than the undercoat, resulting in an overall bleaching effect that washes out the entire color."

    {
      "title": "Look for the Rottweiler traits.",
      "content": "Look for the Rottweiler traits. Just because a dog has the Rottweiler color and a stocky build does not make it a Rottweiler. Other breeds, such as the English Mastiff, American Mastiff, Bullmastiff, or Pit Bull can resemble a Rottweiler, and can produce offspring that may look similar to a purebred Rottweiler. Mixed breeds typically have either the conformation of a Rottweiler or the Rottweiler color, but rarely both. A mastiff mix with a Rottweiler will often have jowls or cheeks that hang below its chin when the mouth is closed, and will have excess skin and wrinkling around the face and head."

      "title": "Notice the dog’s coat.",
      "content": "Notice the dog’s coat. Mixed breeds will often have a longer coat than the short hair of a purebred Rottweiler. Other mixes will produce longer hair than a purebred; one of the most common mixes is Rottweiler with German Shepherd , which sometimes results in a dog with the color and size of a Rottweiler, but the furriness and tail of a German Shepherd. [7] X Research source A lean dog with a long, thin muzzle and Rottweiler coloring may be mixed with a Labrador Retriever or Doberman Pinscher."

      "title": "Look at the stance.",
      "content": "Look at the stance. Because of their athleticism and bite strength, Rottweilers are often crossed with Pit Bulls for the purposes of dog fighting. These crosses are typically smaller than purebred Rottweilers, and have a wider, almost bulldog-like stance. Also, a Rottweiler with a curly tail will always be a mix of some kind.

      "title": "Rule out mixed breeds with proper documentation.",
      "content": "Rule out mixed breeds with proper documentation. In order to be certain that you have a purebred Rottweiler and not, in fact, a mixed breed dog, you should try to acquire some breed registration paperwork. Most purebred dogs have paperwork that accompanies them when they are given to their owners from the breeder. The paperwork will most likely come from the American Kennel Club (AKC) or the United Kennel Club (UKC), the two largest registration organizations in the United States for purebred dogs."

Then, you can mail it back to the company, where they'll determine exactly what kind of breed or mixed breed your dog is. [9] X Research source"
