      "title": "Choose a drop length for your cloth.",
      "content": "Choose a drop length for your cloth. The drop length is how much fabric hangs from the edges of the table. For a standard tablecloth used in informal dining, the drop length is 10 to 12 in (25 to 30 cm). Your tablecloth can have a different drop length than this, so adjust the measurement to suit the design you have in mind. Take all of your measurements in inches, if possible, to easily figure out the total length of cloth you need. [1] X Research source A formal tablecloth ideally reaches the floor. The drop length for such a tablecloth is the table’s height, or close to it. If you aren’t sure what drop length to use, measure your table’s height. Measure from the tabletop down to where you want the tablecloth to end."

      "content": "Measure the length and width if your table is rectangular. Get a measuring tape and take the dimensions of the tabletop. Record the dimensions on a piece of paper along with your chosen drop length. You will need these measurements to figure out how much fabric to get. [2] X Research source Square tabletops follow the same rules as rectangular tabletops. As long as you have the length, width, and drop length, you can calculate how much fabric to get."

      "content": "Find the diameter if your table is round. Round tables are a little bit different than rectangular tables. To measure the diameter, set the tape measure across the center of the table. The diameter is the distance from 1 side of the table to the other. [3] X Research source For oval tables, measure across the table in both directions. Use the longer measurement when calculating how much fabric to get."

    {
      "title": "Choose a hem length for your tablecloth.",
      "content": "Choose a hem length for your tablecloth. In many tablecloths, the edges of the fabric fold up slightly to create a hem. Account for a hem if you plan on adding a feature like mitered corners. Keep the hem length in mind since it adds to the amount of fabric you need to create the tablecloth. [4] X Research source For a neat tablecloth, try a double-fold hem. Plan on each fold being 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm), meaning you need 1 in (2.5 cm) of fabric total to create the hem."

      "title": "Calculate the table’s area to make a square or rectangular tablecloth.",
      "content": "Calculate the table’s area to make a square or rectangular tablecloth. Use a simple mathematical formula to determine how much cloth you need to cover the table. You will need the table’s measurements, along with a pencil and a calculator. Determine the total length and width separately, then multiply them together to figure out the total amount of cloth needed for your design. [5] X Research source The formula for the tablecloth’s width is: table width + (drop length x 2) + (hem length x 2). For example, if your table is 30 in (76 cm) wide with a 20 in (51 cm) drop distance: 30 + (20 x 2) + (1 x 2) = 72. To find the total length of fabric needed, use the formula: table length + (drop length x 2) + (hem length x 2). If your table is 30 in (76 cm) long with a 20 in (51 cm) drop distance: 30 + (20 x 2) + (1 x 2) = 72."

Add the hem length to that sum in order to get a basic estimate of your table’s size. [6] X Research source For round tables, the formula is: diameter + (drop length x 2) + hem length For example, if your table is 30 in (76 cm) wide with an equal drop distance: 30 + (30 x 2) + 1 = 91."

      "title": "Divide the tablecloth area by 36 to determine how much fabric you need.",
      "content": "Divide the tablecloth area by 36 to determine how much fabric you need. This calculation shows you how many yards of cloth you need to buy. Many fabric stores sell cloth by the yard, so take the total with you if you go shopping. The formula only works if you took all your measurements in inches. For other units of measurement, you will need to divide by a different number. [7] X Research source If you chose to measure in feet, divide the total area by 3 to determine your yardage. For measurements in centimeters, divide the total area by 100 to get the total square meters of fabric required for the tablecloth."

      "title": "Lay the fabric upside down and cut it to size.",
      "content": "Lay the fabric upside down and cut it to size. If you’re using patterned fabric, place the patterned side facedown. Spread the cloth out so the “wrong” side, the side that will become the tablecloth’s underside, faces you. Position the fabric across the center part of the table. Then, cut the fabric according to your size, drop length, and hem measurements if it hasn’t been cut already. For a round table, you will need to carefully cut all the way around the fabric. Most of the time, the fabric won’t be big enough. When this happens, cut the fabric into a single section fitting across the table’s diameter, then sew additional pieces to it. If your fabric is a solid color, both of its sides may look similar. Choose the side you like better to serve as the top side of the tablecloth and place it facedown. Many craft supply stores will cut the tablecloth for you if you bring your measurements to the store. Otherwise, mark your measurements on the tablecloth and cut it yourself with a sharp pair of scissors."

      "content": "Cut additional pieces if your table is wider than the fabric. Keep the fabric across the center length of the table. Measure the fabric’s width. Then, subtract that number from the tablecloth width you calculated earlier to determine how much extra fabric you need to complete the design. Cut new pieces of fabric, making them the same length as the original piece. [8] X Research source For the best-looking tablecloth, divide the remaining width by 2. Cut 2 pieces of fabric and use them to border the original piece. Doing this makes your tablecloth look much more even."

      "title": "Set the fabric side by side if your tablecloth consists of multiple pieces.",
      "content": "Set the fabric side by side if your tablecloth consists of multiple pieces. Most of the time, you won’t be able to buy fabric wide enough to fit the table, so you need to use multiple pieces. Center the main piece, draping it across the table’s length. Place the smaller cuts on either side of it. Combined, these pieces will be enough to form the tablecloth according to your original calculations. [9] X Research source If your fabric has a pattern, make sure the patterns on each piece match when you place them next to one another."

      "content": "Pin the bigger piece of fabric over the narrower pieces. Set aside 1 of the narrower pieces for now. Find the selvage edges on the remaining pieces, which feel thicker and more tightly woven. Lay the bigger cut over the smaller one, making sure the selvage edges are flush before you pin the fabric together. [10] X Research source The selvage edges are a little tougher to sew through, but they don’t fray. Using them now reduces the amount of trimming you need to do later to make the tablecloth look perfect."

      "content": "Create a straight stitch along the length of the fabric. Position your needle on the selvage edge or about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) up from the longer edge of the fabric. Sew in a single line to the opposite end of the fabric. Remove the pins as you work. The stitches will bind the fabric pieces together. [11] X Research source A straight stitch is the most basic sewing stitch and it can be made with either a sewing machine or a needle and thread. To make the stitch, weave in and out of the fabric in a straight line. Leave about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of space between each individual stitch."

Align the edges, then begin securing the fabric pieces together. Make a line of straight stitches along the fabric’s length.

      "title": "Iron the seams flat by pressing them open with an iron.",
      "content": "Iron the seams flat by pressing them open with an iron. Plug in a clothing iron and let it heat up. Set the sewn edges of the cloth on the table. Once the iron is hot, run it along the length of each seam. This will flatten the seam, preparing it for cutting. Push the seam flat to smooth out any wrinkles. You may need to go over it a few times, but don’t let the iron sit in place on the fabric."

      "content": "Measure the width of the middle section and smaller panels. The math portion is almost over, but do a little more to ensure the tablecloth is the size you need it to be. Use a tape measure to determine the width of the middle section. Then, subtract that from the tablecloth’s total width. Divide the result by 2 to figure out how wide each of the side panels needs to be. [13] X Research source The formula for finding the width of a side panel is (total width - width of middle section) / 2."

      "content": "Mark the distance from the seams and cut off the extra fabric. Get a fabric marking pen that contrasts the color of fabric you are using for the tablecloth. Using a ruler, measure out from the seams on both sides. Mark the fabric according to the width measurement you calculated, then remove the excess with sharp scissors. [14] X Research source Basically, you cut an even line around the tablecloth to bring it to the correct drop length. When you’re done cutting, the fabric will match the size and shape of your table."

      "title": "Fold the tablecloth and iron it twice to create the hem.",
      "content": "Fold the tablecloth and iron it twice to create the hem. For a basic hem, fold the edge of the tablecloth in by 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). Press it flat with a hot clothing iron. Then, fold the hem in another 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) and iron it flat again. Repeat this around the entire tablecloth to hem it. [15] X Research source Doing this creates a double-fold hem, one of the most basic and useful hems possible. There are many other ways to make a hem, such as with a blind hem stitch or bonding tape."

      "content": "Create mitered corners by folding rectangular tablecloths. Fold the hem on the longer edge of the cloth over the hem on the shorter edge. Unfold the corner to reveal a grid pattern formed by the creases. Draw a diagonal line through the middle square. Cut the fabric along the line, then fold the cut edge down and iron it. Fold in the sides, fold in the cut edge, then fold in the sides again to create the mitered corner. Pin the mitered corner to hold it in place while you work on the other corners. Mitered corners give tablecloths perfect 45-degree edges that fit perfectly over any square or rectangular table."

      "title": "Sew around the hem to complete the tablecloth.",
      "content": "Sew around the hem to complete the tablecloth. Position a sewing needle right beside the edge of the inner fold on the hem. Work all the way around the tablecloth with straight stitches. When you get to a corner, pivot the fabric to continue stitching along the hem. When you’re done, drape the tablecloth over the table to see how well it fits! Start and end with a backstitch . To create a backstitch, start with a straight stitch, loop the needle back, then stitch forward again. Backstitches hold the fabric pieces more strongly together. Remove the pins as you sew around the corners. Iron the hem one last time as needed to keep it flat."
