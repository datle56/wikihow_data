Make sure the TV and radio are off. Turn your phone on silent. If you don't need the internet for your studying, turn your WiFi off so you won't get distracted. [1] X Research source If you like studying with music, make sure it is chill music, without words, that won't have you singing along and getting distracted. You can ask one of your family members to help you keep all the distractions away from you, such as mobile phones and laptops. Reader Poll: We asked 374 wikiHow readers which study space they found most effective for staying focused and productive, and 47% of them said, a quiet library cubicle. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Study one subject at a time instead of multitasking. [2] X Expert Source Sean Alexander, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. If you're feeling really stressed, it's often tempting to work on 3 assignments at the same time, because you're so worried about all of them. But that actually makes each task more unpleasant and difficult to accomplish, makes everything take longer, and means you do a worse job on each task. Instead, devote a chunk of time to studying for one class, take a break, and then start studying for the next class. [3] X Research source Studies have shown that multitasking isn't only ineffective; it's also stressful. You can get much more enjoyment out of a task if you focus on it and do a good job, and then move on to the next thing."

      "content": "Stay organized with a study schedule. Keep a detailed planner listing all your tests and assignments. This can be in a paper planner or online. For each day, write down the homework or studying you have to do and when you plan to do it. It can be helpful to write down other time commitments you have, too. Mark out time slots to work on long-term projects and study for big tests, so that you don't push them to the last minute. [4] X Research source It's also very satisfying to be able to check off each item as you complete it. You feel accomplished!"

      "title": "Take notes and ask yourself questions as you read.",
      "content": "Take notes and ask yourself questions as you read. Reading to study isn't like reading a novel for fun: you have to make sure you are actively focusing on and remembering the information. As you read the material, ask yourself about what you've just read to check your comprehension. Take notes by writing down the chapter headings and then make a few bullet points for each one with key information. If you're not sure what is the most important information to write down, check out the textbook chapter summary, which will often include only the most important points. [5] X Research source Some textbooks will also mark the most important information in bold, or have review sections going over key points. [6] X Research source It will also help you remember the material, and point out areas that you don't understand, where you need to do more studying or ask for help.

      "content": "Take an active break at least every hour. After an hour of sitting and studying, get up and take a little break. You can walk around, eat a snack, do a few push-ups, or go get some air outside. Try to make the break last about 10 minutes so that you can go back to studying. When you take frequent active breaks, you're able to learn much more in the long term than if you try to sit and study for 4 hours without stopping. [8] X Research source Your brain and body need a little activity and fun so that you're able to focus again."

      "content": "Practice a growth mindset. Success in school isn't all about innate talent. It's mostly about effort. Instead of telling yourself, “I'm no good at this subject,” tell yourself, “I can learn more if I ask questions and practice.” Instead of saying, “I'm bad at studying,” say, “I'm going to practice studying more efficiently.” [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Studies have shown that students who practice a growth mindset learn better than students with fixed mindsets, who tell themselves that every setback is a bad thing, instead of an opportunity to grow. Don't worry if you have a more negative mindset now. You can develop a growth mindset with lots of positive self-talk."

      "content": "Make sure you get enough sleep every night. Sleep is the best ingredient to help you focus. Staying up late studying on school nights is not a good idea for long-term success. Lack of sleep prevents you from concentrating and reduces your ability to remember what you have learned. [10] X Research source Aim to get 8-9 hours of sleep a night, or more if that's what you need."

      "content": "Figure out your learning style so you can study more strategically. Different people have different forms of learning that work best for them. Some people are visual learners, which means they learn best from images and reading. Some people are auditory learners, which means they most clearly remember what they hear. Jingles and songs can help them remember information. And some people are tactile learners, also called kinesthetic learners. They learn best by physically handling the things they are learning about. Figure out your learning style and use techniques that best work for you to help study. [11] X Research source For example, a tactile learner would best learn how a clock works by taking one apart and putting it back together. A visual learner would look at a diagram of how the clock worked. A reading/writing learner would read an essay about the clock's function and take notes. An auditory learner would listen to a lecture about it. If you're not sure what you're learning style is, you can take an online quiz about it here: https://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles"

      "content": "Use acronyms and flashcards to help you remember things. Acronyms are made up of the first letter of each word you are trying to remember. One example is the acronym PEMDAS, for remembering that the order of operations in arithmetic is: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. Flashcards are another good tool for memorizing large amounts of information. [12] X Research source Try building a visual memory of things you need to remember if you're a visual learner. For example, if you have to recite a long poem for your English class, try to picture each line or verse as a specific image."

Even if your teacher posts notes online, the physical act of taking notes will make the concepts stick better so that you don't have to frantically learn everything before the test. [13] X Expert Source Sean Alexander, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. Studies have shown that you remember more if you take notes by hand instead of on the computer. Try not to just copy what the teacher has written on the board, but also write down important things your teacher says. Whenever your teacher starts a new topic, mark a new section in your notes and write down some key points. [14] X Research source Taking notes in class also forces you to pay attention. Don't feel the need to write down every word your teacher says."

      "title": "Practice test-taking strategies.",
      "content": "Practice test-taking strategies. Acing a test isn't just about studying the information, it's also about getting the hang of tests. Try practice tests to get the hang of multiple-choice, true-false, short answer, and essay questions. When you're taking the test, mark difficult questions to come back to later instead of spending a long time trying to figure them out. That way you'll have time to answer more questions that you know, and if you have time, you can come back to work on the ones you didn't know. [15] X Research source If you're going to have to write an essay on your test, don't just memorize information that you might have to include. Actually practice writing an essay in a short amount of time, so that when the day comes, you won't feel nervous, because you've done it before."

      "content": "Start studying for exams at least a week in advance. Instead of cramming at the last minute, you should study for about an hour or two every day for a week. This will give you time to gradually prepare and learn everything you need to know without stressing.

      "content": "Join or form a study group. If you have a big test coming up, get together a group of friends from your class to quiz each other and ask each other questions. Be mindful of balancing group and individual study. Group study can be much more fun and you can ask questions, but groups of friends can get distracted really quickly. [17] X Research source If your study group is having trouble focusing, try setting a timer for 45 minutes. Say: “Let's study until the timer rings, and then we'll have a snack break,” or something like that. Having a short, set amount of time to focus is more manageable."

      "title": "Try teaching the concept to somebody else.",
      "content": "Try teaching the concept to somebody else. Studies have shown that teaching a concept to somebody else helps you learn it and retain it far better than just studying it on your own. So if you've got a particularly tricky concept you're trying to learn, try teaching it to a friend. [18] X Research source Depending on the concept, you can also try teaching it to a younger sibling or somebody else who has less knowledge than you. Trying to explain a tricky concept in simple language can clarify your understanding. Also, explain your study concept to someone. This will help you understand the concept better because you're talking out loud. If you can't talk to someone, talk to your pet, your TV, your pillow, your imaginary friend, etc. The point of this isn't to teach someone the concept, it is to read it out loud, but it might feel weird talking to yourself, which is why talking to someone or something can help."

      "content": "Ask for help if you're having a hard time studying. [19] X Expert Source Sean Alexander, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. When you're feeling stuck in your studying for an exam, don't be afraid to ask for help. You can ask for help from a friend who's taking the same class as you, or ask the teacher during class. You can also see if your school offers tutoring, and go ask a tutor for help. [20] X Research source Try your best on a problem before you ask for help from your teacher. Then phrase your question like this, “I tried this, but I couldn't figure it out. Could you help?” or “I understand this part, but I'm confused about that part. What does it mean?” This will make it clear that you're not asking your teacher to do your work for you, you are just looking for clarification."
