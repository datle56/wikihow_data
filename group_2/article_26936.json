      "content": "Gather your materials. For paper cat ears, you’ll only need clear scotch tape, construction paper (one piece is enough), a ruler, scissors, and a headband. You can use glue instead of tape if you don’t have clear tape. Use a headband that matches your hair color so that it blends in when you wear your costume."

      "content": "Draw your cat ears. Draw two equilateral triangles on your construction paper. 3 inch sides are a good size for these cat ears. After drawing your triangle, add ½” to the bottom. This will make it so you can wrap the bottom of the ears around your headband."

      "content": "Cut out your ears. Use your scissors to cut your cat ears out. Line them up together to make sure that they’re equal sizes. Once you get them to be equal sizes, fold a crease along the bottom ½” up."

      "content": "Attach your ears to the headband. Place your headband in the crease of your cat ears so that it sits flat. If you’re using tape, simply fold the ears around your headband and tape around them. If you’re gluing them, glue along the crease of your ears on the inside of your headband.

      "content": "Let them set. If you glued your ears, give them more than enough time to set. If you’ve taped them, you’re ready to wear them! If you want to add something more to your ears, try cutting out white paper in a 1.5” equilateral triangle. Tape or glue this into the center of your ears."
