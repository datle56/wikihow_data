      "content": "Learn as much as you can about the Amish. Before deciding to join the Amish, it is imperative that you learn as much about their religion, history, and lifestyle as possible. The Amish communities of today are descendants of Swiss Anabaptists who emigrated to the United States in the early eighteenth century. [1] X Research source There are approximately 250,000 people living in Amish communities across North America. The largest Amish community is in Holmes County, Ohio; although there are other sizable Amish populations in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Indiana and smaller communities across the Eastern and Mid-Western states, as well as in Canada. Amish is a stricter branch of the Mennonite Anabaptist Church, with which it shares many beliefs and practices. The Amish, with other Anabaptists, reject infant baptism in favor of adult baptism, giving an adult the right to choose their religion and commit to joining the Amish community. The Amish refer to themselves as the \"plain people\" and to anyone outside of the Amish community, regardless of religion or race, as \"Englishers\" or \"high people\". There are many informative websites and books available that cover every aspect of Amish life."

      "title": "Visit an Amish community.",
      "content": "Visit an Amish community. You should do your best to visit an Amish community as part of your research. This will give you some insight into what the day-to-day life of an Amish person is like. Despite popular belief, there are no restrictions on \"English\" people visiting Amish communities. You can visit Amish businesses and converse with the people, most of whom will be willing to answer any questions you might have. [2] X Research source It may even be possible to stay in a bed and breakfast run by a local Amish family. This will give you an even closer look at the Amish way of life, which places God and family above all else. If possible, try to visit several communities on your trip, as different Amish communities will vary slightly in terms of their customs, traditions, and level of strictness and you will need to find the one to which you are best suited. If you cannot travel to an Amish community, you may be able to set up correspondence with an Amish person to gain an insight into their beliefs and way of life. The Amish do not allow computers or, in most cases, telephones, so communicating by post will be your only option. Remember to respect their beliefs and do not take any identifiable photographs of them (the Second Commandment, Exodus 20:4 - \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image...\"). They may allow you to take pictures of their buggy or farms if you ask politely, however. Be aware that some may not feel comfortable (especially women) with talking to outsiders extensively about their faith or lifestyle since they are taught to be modest in everything they do."

      "title": "Decide if you still wish to join.",
      "content": "Decide if you still wish to join. After visiting one or several communities, you need to decide which community you would like to join. Once you have developed a short list of about 3 to 5 communities, you should begin contacting the leading bishop of each community to gauge whether you would be welcome to join their church. Finding the leading bishop should not be too difficult; if the community is on your short list, you have probably already visited it and hopefully developed some contacts there who can help you. Although the Amish do not have any rules forbidding outsiders from joining, it is highly unusual and typically not encouraged, so contacting the bishop is a good way to judge what the community's reaction to a newcomer is likely to be. [3] X Research source If the bishop is open to the idea of you joining their community, he will invite you for an interview, where you can put forward your reasons for wanting to become a member of the Amish. You will need to demonstrate the strength of your faith, your willingness to renounce the ways of the modern world, and your commitment to the Amish way of life. As long as your motives are pure and you are fully aware of what life in an Amish community entails, there should be no objection to you coming to live in the community."

      "title": "Move into an Amish community.",
      "content": "Move into an Amish community. Once you have made your decision and you have received the bishop's permission, you may begin your new life as a member of the Amish. You will first be placed with an Amish family, where you can learn their ways and participate in the household duties. During this time you must prove yourself to the Amish by living according to their religious principles and becoming a productive and valuable member of the community. Once you have done this (there is no set time period), you may be voted into the church and become a true member of the Amish community. Unless you are coming from another branch of the Anabaptist Church with a very similar lifestyle, you are likely to find the transition to Amish living somewhat difficult. Living without electricity, cell phones and motor vehicles is a lot harder for someone who is used to having these luxuries, than it is for people who were brought up in the Amish community and don't know any differently. Although some Amish may be very welcoming and helpful to you as you make your transition, others may be more distrustful of you and not expect you to last very long. Give them time. Once you prove your faith and commitment, they will grow to trust and accept you."

      "content": "Purchase a house and some farmland, if possible. Once you have been voted into the church and no longer need to live with a host family, you may look for a place of your own. Most Amish live in farmhouses surrounded by land that can be used for growing crops and raising animals, as the Amish try to be as self-sufficient as possible. Unfortunately, available farmland is becoming harder to find, due to urban sprawl, high demand for land from an ever-growing Amish community (even though new people rarely join, the average Amish family has seven children) and prohibitively high costs. [4] X Research source You will also need to keep in mind that your home will need to be close enough to the center of the community that it can be reached by horse and buggy, the major method of transportation. This will limit you to about a 10–15 mile (16–24 km) radius."

      "title": "Learn Pennsylvania Dutch.",
      "content": "Learn Pennsylvania Dutch. Pennsylvania Dutch is a dialect of German, which is widely spoken by the Amish community. It is the main language spoken in the home and at Church, although Amish children do learn to speak English in school. Pennsylvania Dutch is primarily a spoken language, with no standardized form of writing or spelling, and must be learned to become fully immersed in the Amish community. As a newcomer to the Amish community, learning to speak the new language will be difficult, but not impossible. You will pick it up just by listening to others, attending Church services and by making an effort to speak it whenever you get the opportunity. It may also be possible to hire a Pennsylvania Dutch tutor who can help you to improve at a faster pace. [5] X Research source The term \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" is a misnomer, as the language has no association with the Netherlands. It is, in fact, a dialect of German that was spoken in parts of Switzerland, Tyrol, and the Rhineland. It is believed the term \"Dutch\" comes from an archaic form of English, which referred to any continental Germanic language. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn to live without modern comforts.",
      "content": "Learn to live without modern comforts. The Amish aim to live a life of simplicity, unfettered by the materialistic trappings of the modern world. However, learning to live without modern comforts can be quite a challenge for people who haven't been brought up in the Amish way. [7] X Research source Learning to live without electricity, which the Amish consider to be \"worldly\" and unnecessary, will perhaps be the greatest challenge of all. Depending on the strictness of the Amish community you have joined, your new home may or may not have running water. If it does not, you will need to use an old-fashioned hand-pump instead. Some homes will use natural gas to provide heat and light, whereas others will use wood or coal-fueled stoves. Telephones are not allowed in most Amish households, though some communities will allow for a shared phone to be installed in a shack or outhouse, which can be used by several families whenever necessary."

      "title": "Get a horse and buggy.",
      "content": "Get a horse and buggy. In addition to restrictions on electricity and modern plumbing systems, the Amish forbid ownership of motor cars. This is because Amish communities thrive on being close-knit and mutually dependent. A motor car would make cities and other \"English\" communities much more accessible and may tempt the Amish to leave their faith and families behind. They also believe that having a motor car might inspire feelings of pride in its owner, and pride is considered to be a serious sin. As a result, Amish communities use a horse and buggy for transport, which is sufficient for covering the distance required to get to Church, visit neighbors and make the trip to Amish supply stores. Consult with your neighbors on where you can get a horse and buggy of your very own. While they can't own or drive a car, the Amish are willing to accept rides and even hire drivers if a necessary trip must be made - to visit far-flung relatives, receive medical treatment, or procure supplies unavailable in Amish stores."

      "title": "Learn to dress appropriately.",
      "content": "Learn to dress appropriately. The Amish style of dress is very distinctive and must be strictly adhered to, by both men and women. Clothes must be plain and unadorned, in solid, dark colors, made from simple, durable fabrics. The simplicity of dress is meant to reflect the Amish way of life, which is practical and unmaterialistic. Vanity or the concept of taking pride in one's appearance is forbidden in Amish culture. Men should wear straight-cut suits without pockets, collars or belts, which women should wear high-necked, long-sleeved, full-skirted dresses, covered by an apron. Any form of patterned fabric, ornamentation or jewellery is not permitted. Men should remain clean-shaven until after marriage when they are required to let their beard grow. Mustaches are not permitted and haircuts can only be given by Amish barbers. Women must wear their hair in a braid or bun, which is then covered by a prayer covering which is a symbol of their subjection to God. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid being photographed.",
      "content": "Avoid being photographed. Amish people will avoid having their picture taken whenever possible. This is because they believe that photographs are a form of \"graven image\" which is forbidden by the Bible. They also believe that having photographs of themselves may inspire vanity, which is forbidden and considered a sin. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule. Some Amish will allow themselves to be photographed as long as their hands or hats cover their faces. Others are okay with being filmed or photographed as long as they are shot in a natural setting, where it's clear that they are not posing for the camera."

      "title": "Participate in a barn raising.",
      "content": "Participate in a barn raising. Barn raisings are an integral part of Amish tradition. They represent some of the most important Amish cultural values - acting selflessly and working together for the good of the community. They are a good example of what is referred to as a \"frolic\" - an Amish work event that combines socializing with a practical purpose. By participating in a barn raising, you get a chance to interact with your neighbors while making a meaningful contribution to the community. [9] X Research source Men from the Amish community work together to build the barn from scratch, according to the plans drawn up by one or two master \"engineers\". They supply all the labor free of charge and may donate supplies and livestock. The project may take as long as a week to complete. [10] X Research source Women participate in the barn-raisings by cooking for the men, while children help with smaller tasks involved in the building and running errands."

      "title": "Study the most important aspects of the Amish religion.",
      "content": "Study the most important aspects of the Amish religion. The Amish believe the best way to express their religious beliefs is to practice the teachings of the Bible in their daily lives. They do not rely on ostentatious or elaborate religious ceremonies and rituals. They live by the biblical instruction \"be not conformed to this world\" (Romans 12:2) which informs their practice of living humbly, separate from the modern world. Two of their most important abiding principles are those of Demut which means humility, and Gelassenheit , which entails calmness, gentleness and surrendering yourself to God's will. [11] X Research source The Amish place great importance on individual study of the Bible, which is considered to be the only source of religious authority. However, you should also get your hands on a copy of a book called \"Martyr's Mirror\", a highly respected publication that chronicles the history of the Amish people and honors those who die for their faith. It should also be noted that although the Amish place utmost importance on living according to the teachings of the Bible, they do not believe that this is a guaranteed path to salvation. They believe that any claim to be \"saved\" is an expression of pride and is therefore forbidden."

      "title": "Attend and host church services.",
      "content": "Attend and host church services. Amish Church service are held every second Sunday, at the home of one of their community members. Each Amish family is expected to host their friends and neighbors for Church about once a year. Every Church district owns a collection of wooden benches, which is transported by wagon to the home of the church family and set up in their house and barn. Seating is arranged with men and boys on one side and women and girls on the other. The service lasts approximately three hours and is followed by a light lunch. The service is said by 3 to 7 ministers and bishops, with the scriptures being read in High German. The main themes preached by the ministers include living a humble and virtuous life in the eyes of God and the idea of \"judge not lest ye be judged\". Personal prayer time is also included, with the congregation kneeling on the floor in silent worship. Although musical instruments are not permitted by the Church, singing is an important part of every Amish service. The congregation sings from a special hymnal called the Ausband , a High German songbook which dates back to the 16th century. The singing is always done in unison, never in harmony. The Amish receive Holy Communion twice a year."

      "title": "Get baptized.",
      "content": "Get baptized. As mentioned before, the Amish are a branch of the Anabaptist church, which believes in adult baptism. The Amish are usually baptized between the ages of 17 and 22, and this ceremony marks their formal membership of the Church and a commitment to always live by the Ordnung , a set of unwritten rules which outlines the behavioral standards all Amish are expected to adhere to. The decision to be baptized must be completely personal and voluntary, you must willingly commit yourself to the Church for the rest of your life. Young people are free to leave the Amish community before they are baptized, and while some of them do, most will decide to commit themselves to the Church. Once baptized, you will be committed to living your life according to the rules of the Ordnung . If you break this commitment and fail to repent for your sins, you may be \"shunned\" by the community, where people will avoid having any social contact with you and you will be forced to eat your meals separately from your family. If you repent you will be accepted back into the community in time, but if you continue to sin you may be excommunicated from the Church. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Get married.",
      "content": "Get married. Members of the Amish community can only marry once they have been baptized and are required to marry other Amish, though a couple may come from two different Amish communities. Most of a couple's courtship is done in secret, with the engagement only being \"published\" several weeks before the marriage. Most weddings occur in the fall, after the autumn harvest and are a joyous occasion, celebrating the union of two baptized adults, who promise to continue living according to Amish traditional values and to pass their faith on to their children. An Amish wedding ceremony is quite different from that of the \"English\". No rings are exchanged, there are no flowers or music, and the bride traditionally makes her own dress, which is blue or purple. In fact, the ceremony is very similar to a regular church service, except there is a greater emphasis on the ordinance of marriage, which is taken particularly seriously, as divorce is forbidden by the Amish church. [13] X Research source After the ceremony, a huge feast is held at the home of the bride's parents, with as many as 200 to 300 guests. The guests are often served in separate sittings, followed by the singing of hymns. The couple's honeymoon period is spent visiting all of their relatives over the course of several weekends, at which point they will also collect their wedding gifts. Once an Amish man is married, he will begin to grow his beard - the symbol of a married man. The couple will usually be ready to move into a home of their own by the spring following their wedding."

      "content": "Become an elected member of the church (if you're a man). Amish bishops and deacons are chosen differently from church leaders in other faiths. Groups of men are first elected by the congregation, and then lots are drawn to decide who will become the new minister. Only baptized, married Amish men are eligible to become ministers, and they are obligated to accept the responsibility once they have been nominated. They will usually serve in this ministerial position for life. [14] X Research source Amish bishops and ministers do not receive any formal, theological training; they are simply called upon by their community to uphold and enforce the teachings of the Bible and the rules of the Ordnung . The system for drawing lots works by placing a sheet of paper with a Bible verse into the pages of a songbook. This songbook is then arranged in a row of other songbooks. Each nominated man must choose a songbook, and whoever picks the songbook with the Bible verse concealed inside is said to have been chosen by God to serve the Amish Church."
