    {
      "title": "Make a hole in the cap.",
      "content": "Make a hole in the cap. Start by unscrewing the cap from a 2-liter or comparable plastic bottle such as a Gatorade bottle, milk bottle, or fruit juice bottle,. For this, you’ll need a hole punching tool, a drill , a knife, or scissors. Twist the implement until you screw a hole through the center of the cap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Widen the hole to pinky-sized.",
      "content": "Widen the hole to pinky-sized. Continue to cut away the inside of the plastic cap until the hole widens. Pinky-sized is an average size to shoot for. Larger holes will give you quicker draws but use up your smokeable faster. If you’re going to use a bowl piece, widen the hole until the bowl piece fits."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tear off a square of aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Tear off a square of aluminum foil. Rip off a piece that’s big enough to contain the cap. Include extra length so you have enough foil to use. Place the cap aside for a moment. Instead of foil, use a socket for a socket wrench , a thimble, or another circular piece of metal that you can use to hold your smoking substance. The danger from using foil is a common myth, but the foil does not release enough aluminum during smoking to cause harm to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mold the aluminum into a bowl.",
      "content": "Mold the aluminum into a bowl. Use your finger as a guide. Hold your finger in the center of the foil, then carefully wrap the foil upwards and around your finger. The bowl will have the shape of your finger and fit inside the cap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the foil inside the cap.",
      "content": "Place the foil inside the cap. Pick up the cap and keep it top side up as you push the foil into cap’s hole.. Turn the stuck up ends of the foil down and smooth them against the plastic cap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Poke holes in the foil.",
      "content": "Poke holes in the foil. Set the cap down and get a hole punching tool. A mechanical pencil or toothpick work well if you don’t have a tool from a hardware store. Poke a couple of holes on the part of the foil over the hole in the cap, about four to six to let enough smoke through. Scatter them about so the foil doesn’t break. If the holes are too big, your substance of choice will fall through. While sockets and other metal can also use foil, you can line the inside of the socket with metal mesh to create a bowl."

    {
      "title": "Cut off the end of the taller bottle.",
      "content": "Cut off the end of the taller bottle. Find the Gatorade or 2-liter bottle. Measure a quarter to halfway up the bottle. Using a knife or scissors, make a cut where you measured. Cut all the way around the bottle. This bottle will hold the smoke."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the top off a larger container.",
      "content": "Cut the top off a larger container. A water or milk jug wider than the bottle you already cut works for this purpose. Measure down a quarter or halfway from the top, then cut the bottle the same way as you did the other one. Instead of a bottle, you can simply use a large container such as a bucket, coffee pot, pitcher, or stopped sink, You won’t have to cut these."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the larger container halfway with water.",
      "content": "Fill the larger container halfway with water. Set the container down and fill it up with tap water. Limit the amount of water so that the container is only half-full. This amount will give you enough gravity to make the bong work without making a mess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Load the bowl.",
      "content": "Load the bowl. Place your favorite legal smoking material on the foil inside the indentation you made earlier. Do this before you assemble the rest of the bong or else the pressure will make the smokeable fly out. When picking up the cap, make sure your substance of choice isn’t falling through the holes in the foil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the bottle in the water.",
      "content": "Place the bottle in the water. Pick up the top part of the Gatorade or 2-liter bottle you cut earlier and move it into the water. If your water container is big, you may need to hold onto it. Retrieve the cap with the bowl and screw it onto the bottle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Light the substance while pulling up the bottle.",
      "content": "Light the substance while pulling up the bottle. Hold the bottle down as you ready your lighter . Light up your bowl. As you light it, slowly pull the bottle upwards with your other hand. You should notice milky smoke filling the bottle. Make sure you don’t pull the bottle out of the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unscrew the cap and smoke.",
      "content": "Unscrew the cap and smoke . Once smoke has filled the bottle, it is ready for use. Unscrew the cap. To smoke, place your lips around the bottle and push down. The smoke will easily shoot out."
