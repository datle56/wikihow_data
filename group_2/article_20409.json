      "content": "Understand that hamsters are crepuscular. This means that, while hamsters are not technically nocturnal (awake only at night), they are most active during dawn and dusk periods, and will be more active at night than during the day. [1] X Research source If you have a hamster in your room, they will naturally want to play at night."

      "content": "Play with your hamster during the early evening. If your hamster wants to sleep, let it, but as soon as it’s awake again, continue playing with it. This may incline your hamster to stay up more during the day, since it will enjoy the play and attention, and the hamster may then be tired out and sleep better at night. Do this for several days or even weeks until your hamster starts to wake up earlier in the evenings to play. Your hamster will still be active at night, but you can teach it to expect some activity during the day, too."

[2] X Research source Chances are, your hamster won’t be able to resist the smell and will get up to eat, they may stay awake to play. If you do this routinely, your hamster will associate getting up earlier with getting fed, and it will begin to get up earlier naturally."

      "content": "Be sensitive to your breed of a hamster. You should be able to find out what breed of hamster you own, either by checking with the pet-store clerk (before or after you buy the pet) or by looking up your hamster’s physical description online. The three most common types of hamster are Dwarf, Syrian, and Chinese. [3] X Research source Syrian hamsters have relatively inflexible sleep schedules. They need to sleep during the day and have their activity times during evening and night. Dwarf and Chinese hamsters, on the other hand, have more flexible sleep schedules. They may get used to activities during the day, and begin to wake up naturally for play. [4] X Research source"

Sleep-deprived hamsters may become irritable and even bite their owners, or they may develop stress-induced illnesses. [5] X Research source Do not force your hamster to be awake at a time when it normally wouldn’t be. Since hamsters are not strictly nocturnal, they will naturally have periods of activity during the day. Don’t expect a healthy hamster to sleep through the whole day without stirring.

Since these are the times that your hamster will naturally be most awake and hence most playful, plan on daily playtimes with your hamster, especially in the evening. [7] X Research source Regular play with your hamster will also help tire it out, so it will sleep more soundly during the day. If you can encourage your hamster to run on its wheel before you’re in bed and asleep, it may result in your hamster being more relaxed and quiet while you’re asleep."

If you don’t want to be kept awake at night by your hamster as it eats, runs about its cage, and is generally active, put its cage somewhere out of earshot. For example, you could keep your hamster’s cage: [8] X Research source On the floor in your bathroom. In a spare room or guest room in your house. In your living room, if it will be quiet and dark at night."

It’s important to give your hamster a quiet space to sleep in, so it can fully rest during the day and not become sick or stressed. [9] X Research source For example, if your living room is often loud and crowded during the day, that would not be a good location to keep your hamster’s cage. If you recently bought your hamster from a bright, crowded pet store, it may take time for them to settle into a regular sleeping routine. To help them along, keep their cage for a quiet room for as much of the day as possible. [10] X Research source"

Hamsters need to be in a fully dark setting at night, just like they would be in nature. If you have a night light in your room or keep your hamster in a room that stays bright at night, you’ll need to move the cage location. [11] X Research source Darkness at night will make your hamster feel energized and comfortable. If it’s light at night, your hamster may become confused & uncertain how it should behave. Be consistent with the amount of light and darkness your hamster receives every day. In general, hamsters should have 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day. [12] X Research source"

Although hamsters love human interaction and thrive on getting gently petted, played with, and picked up, they will need time to learn to trust you. [13] X Research source For the first week that you own your hamster, avoid making quick movements around it. Let the hamster sniff you before you touch it or pick it up. After about a week, your hamster will develop trust and you can start to pick it up more regularly."

Never squeeze or trap the hamster with your hands. If it seems agitated or uncomfortable, but the hamster back in its cage. Never wake your hamster up to play. When they’re sleeping during the day, let your hamster rest. If you wake it up and attempt to play, the hamster may bite you. [15] X Research source"

This should be in the early evening (when it’s just waking up) or late morning (when it’s going to bed). Try sitting down or remaining still when you’re holding your sleepy hamster, and soon you’ll find it sleeping in your hand. Don’t pick your hamster up once it’s already asleep."

This will also be the case for very old hamsters, whose quality of life has begun to decline. Euthanasia is inexpensive, and vets may be willing to perform the procedure for free if your hamster is suffering. DO NOT attempt to put your hamster to sleep at home. Although they are small and delicate animals, hamsters, like any other animal, should only be euthanized by professional veterinarians."
