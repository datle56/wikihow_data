Hold the hair between your fingers, and work from the center towards the outer edge of your hair. Take care when you cut—you can always cut more if you want them shorter, but will have to wait for your hair to grow out if you cut it too short. For side-swept bangs, hold the scissors at an angle when you cut. [5] X Research source"
