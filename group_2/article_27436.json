      "content": "Empty the bottle of Everclear into a large container. In a large container, empty an entire 750 ml bottle of Everclear or another type of clear grain alcohol with a neutral flavor. A single bottle is sufficient for a small party of 10 or less, but if you’re expecting a larger crowd, you’ll want to use two or three bottles. Traditionally, hunch punch is mixed in a 5 gallon (19 l) cooler. If using one, make sure that it’s clean before pouring in the Everclear."

      "title": "Mix in the fruit punch and stir.",
      "content": "Mix in the fruit punch and stir. Once the Everclear is in the container, add 1 gallon (3.8 l) of fruit punch. Use a long-handled spoon to mix the punch together to ensure that the fruit punch is fully blended with the alcohol. You can use a bottle of ready-made fruit punch or mix up your own using powdered drink packets. Just make sure that it adds up to 1 gallon of fruit punch. If you’re using additional bottles of Everclear in the punch, you’ll need to add more fruit punch as well. For every 750 ml bottle of alcohol, mix in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of the fruit punch."

      "title": "Add ice and serve.",
      "content": "Add ice and serve. When the Everclear and fruit punch are completely mixed, add as much ice as desired to chill the punch. Use a ladle to pour the punch into cups and serve. If you don’t want to use ice, you can refrigerate the fruit punch overnight to chill it before adding it to the alcohol."

      "title": "Empty the fruit punch and juices in a large container.",
      "content": "Empty the fruit punch and juices in a large container. In a 5 gallon (19 l) cooler or other large container, combine 3 gallons (11 l) of fruit punch, 16 ounces (473 ml) of frozen orange juice that's been thawed, and 16 ounces (473 ml) of pineapple juice. Mix well with a long-handled spoon to ensure that the ingredients are well blended. [1] X Research source You can combine the fruit punch with any two types of juice that you like. Other options to consider include grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, or pomegranate juice."

      "title": "Add the soda and ginger ale.",
      "content": "Add the soda and ginger ale. When the fruit punch and juices are fully combined, stir in 8 cups (1.9 l) of lemon lime soda and 8 cups (1.9 l) of ginger ale. Use the spoon to mix all of the liquids together. [2] X Research source You can use any types of soda that you like in the punch, but fruity or light flavors tend to work best. Flavored seltzer is also a good option."

      "title": "Mix in the alcohol.",
      "content": "Mix in the alcohol. Once the base of the punch is completely mixed, it’s time to add the alcohol. Pour an entire 750 ml bottle of Everclear and an entire 750 ml bottle of vodka into the punch, and stir well to ensure that the punch ingredients are fully combined. [3] X Research source You can substitute another clear, neutral flavored grain alcohol for the Everclear if you prefer."

Next, mix some orange and pineapple slices, and give the entire mixture a good stir to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully blended. You can substitute any juice that you like for the pineapple juice. Orange, grapefruit, and cranberry all work well. You can mix whatever type of sliced fruit you like into the punch. For the best flavor, match the slices to the juice, though."
