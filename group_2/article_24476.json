      "content": "“Hell” is considered a swear word when used in anger or for emphasis. Unless you’re talking about hell in a religious context, it’s technically considered a curse word in the English language. However, many people don’t find the word as offensive as other swears, so some do not consider it a proper swear word. [1] X Research source Examples of cursing include \"Go to hell!\" and \"For hell's sake!\" Hell can also be used in a casual, conversational way, but it's still considered a swear word in those instances. Someone might say, \"Hell if I know\" or \"It was a hell of a party!\""

[21] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source However, slurs (insulting language that targets demographic groups) are not harmless. Studies show that hearing slurs can cultivate prejudice. Exposure to slurs is also linked to an increase in depression and anxiety. Slurs are extremely offensive and should not be used. [22] X Research source Slattengren adds, “It’s so important in a loving relationship to treat each other with respect.” If you’re constantly cursing at or around someone who finds it offensive, they’re not going to feel respected!"
