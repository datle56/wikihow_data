      "title": "A cool mint flavor can give zero sugar soda an extra kick.",
      "content": "A cool mint flavor can give zero sugar soda an extra kick. Zero sugar and diet beverages use artificial sweeteners to substitute the high fructose corn syrup or sucrose found in regular sodas. Adding mint flavor to a diet drink won’t make the drink taste minty, but it can help combat that artificial taste. With many people having breath mints in their bags already, this is the perfect hack for on the go! Steer clear of Mentos when trying this hack unless you want an epic soda geyser in your living room. Try using a sugar free mint to keep your drink sugar free."
