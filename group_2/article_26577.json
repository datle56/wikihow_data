      "content": "Be honest with him about how you feel. Depending on how your affair began, it’s possible that he doesn’t realize you’ve fallen in love. It can be painful to love a man who isn’t giving you that love back. Talk to him about how you feel and what you want. This can help you either move forward in your relationship with him or figure out if it’s time to move on. You might say, “I know we started this as a fling, but I’ve fallen in love with you. I want to discuss our future.” It’s possible that he’ll get upset when you tell him the truth. If he has a negative response, call a trusted friend for support."

      "content": "Avoid trying to compete with his partner. When you know your man is with another person, it’s normal to want to feel superior to them. However, trying to best his partner is unlikely to get him to leave them and will probably make you miserable. Instead, focus on being your best self and doing things that are important to you. If it’s meant to be, he’ll love you for who you are. Don’t stalk your man’s partner on social media or ask your friends to check up on them. Similarly, don’t ask him about what his partner is doing. Understand that there are many reasons he may be staying with his current partner, like his children, financials, or emotional well-being, and it may not simply be a matter of who he “loves more.” [1] X Research source When you find your thoughts straying to questions like, “Why does he pick her?” turn your attention to what’s going well in your life. Tell yourself, “I’ve had a great weekend,” “I just got a raise,” or “I have the best friends.”"

      "content": "Forgive yourself for falling in love with a married man if you feel guilty. You might feel guilty for letting yourself fall in love with a guy who is unavailable. This is normal, but torturing yourself isn’t going to make things better. Remind yourself that your emotions aren’t something to be ashamed of, and that wanting to feel love and happiness isn’t wrong. [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Tell yourself, “It’s impossible to control who you fall in love with. I deserve to find love, so I’m not going to feel guilty for falling in love with someone who’s unavailable.” Write yourself a letter of forgiveness, then destroy it. This can be a cathartic exercise that helps you work through your feelings."

[3] X Research source If you feel like you have no one to turn to, a therapist may be the answer. They’ll focus on what’s best for you in a non-judgemental way.

      "content": "Avoid changing your plans because he wants to see you. When you’re dating a married man, he will typically put his family first. That may mean that it’s hard to make plans. However, your time is just as valuable as his, and you deserve to be respected. Don’t change your existing plans because he decides he has time for you.

Or you may not care about marriage, but you may hope that you have some type of future together. Tell him exactly what that future looks like for you. Then, give him a specific timeline for when you expect things to happen so he can’t string you along. [8] X Research source For instance, let’s say you want him to leave his wife and marry you. Say, “You’ve always promised me that I was the one you want. I want you, too. If we’re going to continue this, I expect you to start divorce proceedings in the next 3 months so we can get married by the end of next year.” Offer to support him through any hardship brought about by divorce or the ending of the other relationship, and let him know that you’re in this together.
