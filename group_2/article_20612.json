      "content": "Flood the eye by splashing water into your eyes. [1] X Research source This is the easiest and fastest method of removing an eyelash. Splashing your eyes with water can cause the eyelash to simply be rinsed out with the water. Mineral and bottled water is ideal as it's more sterile than tap water. You can use tap water if you don't have mineral or bottled available. Cup your hands, catch some water in them, and splash into open eyes. It is okay to blink when the water touches your eye. Repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone."

      "content": "Rinse the eye by lowering your open eyes into water. This is another, slightly gentler way to rinse out the eyelash using water. Use mineral or bottled water if you have it. Pour water into a large bowl. Slowly lower your face, with open eyes, into the water until the liquid touches your eyes. If you feel the urge to blink when your eyes touch the water, do so. All that matters is that the liquid touches your eye. The eyelash should then wash out into the bowl. Repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone."

Blink and if necessary, repeat several times until the eyelash is washed out."

      "title": "Locate the problem lash.",
      "content": "Locate the problem lash. For this method of removal, you need to set the stage by locating the eyelash and washing your hands. Look in a mirror to see where in your eye the lash is located. You should use your fingers or a cotton swab to remove only if the eyelash is on the white part and not the colored part of the eye. The colored part is more sensitive and you may want to see an eye doctor instead if the eyelash is there. [4] X Research source Wash your hands . Use soap, and dry your hands completely. Washing your hands removes bacteria that you could otherwise get into your eye."

      "title": "Remove with a cotton swab.",
      "content": "Remove with a cotton swab. Make sure that the cotton of the cotton swab has not loosened, as you don't want any particles coming off into your eye. If try this more than once, use a new cotton swab for hygiene each time you touch your eye. Moisten a cotton swab by immersing the tip in saline solution. [5] X Research source Saline solution will not hurt the eye. To get the cotton swab wet, you can either unscrew the lid of a saline bottle solution, and dip the cotton swab in, or pour a little into a bowl, and dip the cotton swab into that. Touch the cotton swab gently to the eyelash. Keep your eye open while doing so. You may want to hold your eyelids open with the fingers of one hand while holding the cotton swab with the other. Remove the eyelash. Ideally, the eyelash sticks to the cotton swab and is removed safely and easily. Simply pull the cotton swab directly backward, taking the eyelash with it."

      "title": "Remove",
      "content": "Remove with your fingers. This method involves either swiping or pulling it out with your fingers. Make sure that your hands are clean and that you keep your eyes open. Swipe the eyelash with one finger. You may want to hold the eyelids of the affected eye open with the fingers of your non-dominant hand. With one finger of the other hand, gently swipe the eyelash in a light sliding motion. Try not to blink. The eyelash should be dislodged from the eye by the motion of your finger. Pull the eyelash with two fingers. If a simple swipe doesn't dislodge it, try gently pinning it between two fingers. Your fingers should rest gently on your eye as you pin the eyelash between them. Do not use this method if you have very long fingernails, as you may scratch your eye. Once you have the eyelash caught between two fingers, pull it gently directly outward."
