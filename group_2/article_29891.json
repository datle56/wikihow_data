      "title": "Look for very ripe fruits.",
      "content": "Look for very ripe fruits. Since you won't be able to break up fruits that are firm and full of fiber, purchase soft fruits that you'll be able to mash by hand. Keep in mind that fruits are softest when they're completely ripe. Consider basing your smoothie on 1 or a combination of these fruits: Kiwi Mango Banana Pears Berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, or raspberries"

      "title": "Try soft vegetables or vegetable puree.",
      "content": "Try soft vegetables or vegetable puree. Although most vegetables will be too fibrous to use in a smoothie without a blender, you can use an avocado that's ripe and soft. Remember that you can also include a few spoonfuls of vegetable puree, such as pumpkin, butternut squash, or carrot. [1] X Research source Pureed vegetables will also help thicken your smoothie and give it a bright color."

    {
      "title": "Include proteins that will thicken the smoothie.",
      "content": "Include proteins that will thicken the smoothie. Soft fruits usually make up most of blender-less smoothies, but you'll need filling ingredients to add protein and give the smoothie a creamy texture. Use your favorite type of yogurt, peanut butter, or chia seeds to add protein. [2] X Research source Instead of peanut butter, you can use tahini or sunflower butter, which will give your smoothie protein with less sugar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a liquid to thin the smoothie.",
      "content": "Choose a liquid to thin the smoothie. You probably won't need very much liquid in your smoothie, but it's good to have nutritious liquids on hand just in case. For a creamy smoothie, get out milk or your favorite alternative milk, such as almond or soy milk. To make your smoothie sweeter, use fruit juice. [3] X Research source For example, use apple, grape, orange, or pineapple juice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include powders for protein or flavor.",
      "content": "Include powders for protein or flavor. Customize your smoothie by stirring in extra flavors or protein powders. If you're adding protein powder, use the amount recommended by the manufacturer. To add flavors, consider using: [4] X Research source Cocoa powder Matcha powder Maca powder Spices, such as nutmeg, cinnamon, or turmeric"
    },
    {
      "title": "Mash soft fruits and vegetables.",
      "content": "Mash soft fruits and vegetables. Rinse and remove peels from the ripe fruit. Then place as much fruit as you want into a bowl and use the back of a spoon, a fork, or a potato masher to smash the produce until it's as smooth as possible. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that there will probably be a few small lumps in the pureed fruits and vegetables."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the mashed produce with your choice of smoothie ingredients.",
      "content": "Stir the mashed produce with your choice of smoothie ingredients. Spoon the mashed fruits or vegetables into a bowl and add any thickeners or powders that you want. Then stir until the powders are dissolved and all of the ingredients are combined. For example, to make a classic strawberry banana smoothie, put mashed strawberries and bananas into a bowl along with a few spoonfuls of yogurt. Stir to combine the smoothie."

    {
      "title": "Shake the smoothie with ice if you want a foamy drink.",
      "content": "Shake the smoothie with ice if you want a foamy drink. While you can drink the smoothie as soon as it's combined, you may want it to be colder. Put a few ice cubes into a large jar and pour the smoothie into it. Seal the jar and shake it until the smoothie is cold and foamy. This should take about 30 seconds. To make a frosty smoothie, stir crushed ice into the smoothie just before serving. Keep in mind that the smoothie will have a slushy texture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your chosen liquid to adjust the thickness of your smoothie.",
      "content": "Add your chosen liquid to adjust the thickness of your smoothie. Once you've combined the main smoothie ingredients, taste it and decide if it's as thick or thin as you want. To thin the smoothie, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of juice or milk until the smoothie is the consistency you like. If the smoothie isn't thick enough for your liking, stir in more yogurt or chia seeds. Chia seeds take a few minutes to thicken, so let the smoothie rest before drinking it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enjoy the cold smoothie.",
      "content": "Enjoy the cold smoothie. Pour the smoothie into a serving glass and drink it immediately. Because the ingredients weren't blended together by machine, they'll probably begin to separate faster. If this happens, just stir the smoothie with a long spoon and drink it through a straw. [6] X Research source Refrigerate any leftover smoothie in an airtight container for up to 2 or 3 days. You'll need to stir or shake it again before drinking."
