Here's how to make and apply a sea salt soak: [3] X Research source Stir and dissolve ¼ tsp (1.42 g) of sea salt in 8 fl oz (240 mL) of warm water in a cup or bowl. Dip a Q-tip in the solution and apply the soak onto your piercing bump. Leave it for a few minutes, then gently wipe away any loose skin or debris. You can also purchase a saline spray and simply spray the solution onto your bump. Another alternative is to use a dropper to rinse your piercing with the sea salt soak. [4] X Research source"
