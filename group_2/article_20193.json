      "content": "Wait until you're calm. Relationship coach Amy Chan says it's best to wait at least a few days after the breakup so you'll have time to process things and get your emotions under control. Once you’ve given yourself a few days to grieve the breakup, head over to get your stuff. This way, you can go into the situation in a calmer, more collected fashion. Get enough sleep, go out with friends, and spend a day pampering yourself to help yourself feel better. Licensed psychologist Sarah Schewitz says getting over a partner looks different for everyone. It may take you longer to calm down if the breakup was recent or the relationship lasted for a long time. Don't wait too long. It's best to retrieve your things within a couple of weeks of the breakup."

      "content": "Send a text. A phone call can get messy and emotional, so send a text with a simple message to keep your composure. For example, text something like, \"I still have some things at your place. Is there a good time to come over and pick them up?\" [1] X Research source You may have to call if your ex does not return your texts after a few days. Try to keep the call brief and concise."

      "title": "Schedule a time to pick up your things.",
      "content": "Schedule a time to pick up your things. Your ex may prefer not to be there when you pick up your stuff, so you may want to stop by while they're at work or out of the house. If your ex wants to be present , however, find a time that works for both of your schedules. Be as agreeable as possible, even if it's painful. Petty arguments often surface after breakups due to lingering emotions, so remind yourself to remain composed, especially if you get angry. If you're having a hard time scheduling a pick-up time, see if your smaller items can be mailed to you."

      "content": "Only discuss the essentials and avoid talking about the breakup. When negotiating when to come over, stick to discussing the essentials and only talk about the things you need to grab. You don't want to trigger an argument about the breakup. Try to communicate in 5 minutes or less to prevent you or your ex from becoming emotional.

If you're not comfortable with your ex touching your things, let them know you're happy to box everything up yourself. However, if you don't mind, you can have them box up your items to speed up the process. Make sure you're respectful when asking your ex to box up your items. Say something like, \"Is there any way you could gather my things for me so we can get through this quickly & smoothly?\""

      "content": "Enlist the help of a friend. If you don't want to go over alone, have a friend help you. This can also be useful if you left any big items, like electronics, at your ex's place. If you had an extremely messy breakup, a trusted friend can even agree to retrieve items for you so you don’t have to interact with your ex in person. [3] X Research source Make sure you pick the right friend to help. A friend who's prone to drama may be tempted to start a fight with your ex. Instead, opt for a friend who's generally cool and composed, even in stressful situations. If your ex is giving you a really hard time about retrieving your stuff, contact a friend or family member of your ex that you are on good terms with. They may be willing to help you."

If you want to be pleasant, stick to small talk and simple questions rather than bringing up any major issues. [4] X Research source Life coach Christina Jay says that if the relationship ended on a friendly basis, keep the conversation short and polite, then move on with your day. For example, ask, \"How's work?\" or make a comment on the weather. Avoid open questions and topics that could yield negative answers. For example, asking how your ex has been doing may lead to them talking about their difficulty with the breakup. They may act fine to hurt your feelings."

Focus on the fact you're there to get your stuff and not address any lingering issues with your ex. As soon as you get through the door, start gathering your things and leave as soon as you finish. If you want to say a goodbye before you go, keep it brief. Now is not the time to drag up lingering resentments or talk over the relationship. Say something like, \"I'm going to take off now. I hope you're doing okay.\""

There will likely be some disagreement, which should be addressed calmly. Discuss the items that you both would like to keep and do your best to come to a compromise for the ones you have a hard time agreeing on. [6] X Research source For example, you may have bought a TV together. See if your ex would trade. Maybe you also both really like a particular coffee table, but your ex is a little more attached. Agree to let them have the coffee table if you can have the TV. For items you absolutely can't agree on, see if your ex is willing to sell the item and split the money."

The pet should go to the primary caregiver. Whoever has the most time to care for the pet should take it in the breakup . [7] X Research source For example, say you have a dog with your ex. If your job has long and demanding hours, but your ex’s is work-from-home, it makes sense to let them take the dog, as they'll be able to provide it with the most attention and care. It can be hard to let go of a pet. If you and your ex are still on good terms, try to have visiting hours with the pet or occasionally meet up at a local dog park."

If they gave you an item of clothing or household device, that's generally yours to keep. However, if they gave you a sentimental item, like a ring or something that they hold dear, it's best to return it.

It's worth splurging on, say, a new television set if it means ending a prolonged argument and making a clean break from your ex. If your ex won't let go of an item and is unwilling to compromise, let them have their way. [9] X Research source Taking the high road can help when it comes to recovering from a breakup. [10] X Research source In some cases, however, you may need to bring in a friend or even a lawyer to mediate. If your ex is insisting on keeping expensive items that you legally own, it may be worth trying to get them back. Couples counselor Raffi Bilek says that if your partner is yelling at you, go somewhere else and calm down, then return to the conversation once you have both simmered."
