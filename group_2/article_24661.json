Visualize the push-off and see yourself leaping in the air toward (or over) your target. You'll be focused on the series of steps and tasks you're about to complete, ensuring a successful jump."

Your knees should be bent at 60 degrees and your ankle should be flexed at 25 degrees. This will generate the most power without injuring your knees."

      "content": "Do squats. To do a squat, simply stand with your back straight, against a wall if you'd like. Your knees should be shoulder-width apart and your legs should be about 18 inches (46 cm) in front of you. Slowly squat by sitting down till you are level with your knees. These exercises develop the hamstrings, glutes, and quads which are the key drivers to helping you jump higher. If you feel pain at any time, stop the exercise."

      "content": "Work out your calves by doing calf raises . Build strength in these muscles by gripping a raised surface with your toes and using your calf muscles to do short dips. You can try doing calf raises with one leg at a time, both legs, or even from a seated position. The calves are another important muscle group in improving your jumping. Try holding some weight while you do this to increase the resistance and build strength."

      "content": "Improve your flexibility by stretching. Stretch your hamstrings and buttocks by laying on your back with one leg crossed over the other at the knee. Pull the lower leg toward you firmly and steadily. This should stretch the hamstring of the crossed leg. For another exercise, touch your toes while seated, standing, with your legs spread, and with your legs crossed. If you're not flexible you'll develop an imbalance of strength. This could limit your ability to jump. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source"

      "title": "Continue practicing jumps and squats.",
      "content": "Continue practicing jumps and squats. Jumps, hops, and lunges are known as plyometrics. Plyometrics are high intensity movements which increase your heart rate quickly. Endurance training can actually improve your quick twitch muscle fibers, making jumping more powerful. For a maximum exercise, try holding about one-third of the weight that you normally lift. Jump explosively and repeat it as many times as you can."
