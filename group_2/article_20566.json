      "content": "Exude confidence. You don't have to be a \"bad boy\" to display confidence in yourself. Stay relaxed and comfortable in any situation. Be assertive; use a firm, clear voice, and speak your mind. She's probably used to being the most confident person in the room. Stand out and show her that you're just as sure of yourself. Assertiveness is the key, not aggression. Come on too strong and you risk looking like a jerk. Let your personality speak for itself.

      "title": "Relate to her.",
      "content": "Relate to her. Find things that the two of you have in common, no matter how small. You don't have to dress the same or have the same favorite band, but the more she can relate to you, the more comfortable she'll be around you. [2] X Research source Finding things you have in common can be as broad and impassioned as political beliefs or as casual as your favorite breakfast cereal. Take this opportunity to get to know more about her, and as you do, you'll find that you have more things you connect with."

    {
      "title": "Be a little bit mysterious.",
      "content": "Be a little bit mysterious. While it's great to be direct, assertive and up front, leave a little for her to wonder about. She'll want to know more about you if you keep her guessing, and you'll come off as a more complex person. This could be the lead-in you need for your next conversation or date. [3] X Research source Hold a little back in conversation. Don't be too eager or talk about yourself too much. Let her imagination do some work in figuring you out. Don't complain.

      "content": "Don't try too hard. There's no need to lay it on too thick. She'll know if you're boasting or trying to seem more appealing to her, and talking yourself up too much can be annoying. Confidence and assertiveness are qualities that anyone can develop, not stand-ins for your innate personality. If you get too wrapped up in trying to impress her, you'll lose sight of yourself. Trust her enough to let her make up her own mind about what she wants."

      "content": "Find out what makes her tick. Make it your mission to discover what sets her apart from the rest and understand her motivations. You can accomplish this by talking to her, and you should, but also pay attention to unspoken cues like body language and the way she interacts with others. [4] X Research source She may hold on to a tough or uninviting persona due to the way she's been treated by others in the past. Approach her with no judgment, and don't make her feel cornered when getting to know her. Everyone is different. Be careful making assumptions about her character or trying to analyze her based on the way she looks or the things other people say about her."

      "title": "Show an interest in her interests.",
      "content": "Show an interest in her interests. Even if you're not that keen on the books she reads or her favorite place to eat, make an effort to know what they are. Get involved in the things that are important to her. If you like her, you should be accepting of her interests, as they're part of what makes her who she is. Listen actively when she talks about her interests, and be enthusiastic when talking about yours. Ask her for recommendations for new things to try, watch, read and listen to. Go where you know she might be. Don't be creepy about it, but listen for cues about things she likes and look into them for yourself. If you know she's into roller derby, go watch a match. If you happen to run into her, tell her you were intrigued by what the two of you talked about and wanted to learn more."

Friends are not instruments for getting her in your corner.

[6] X Research source Now you can both start to enjoy your common interests together. Rather than just following her recommendations, ask if she'd mind having you along to a show or event, or invite her to take part in something you can do together. If you have mutual friends, organize a group outing. A casual setting and the comfort of having your friends around is the best environment for cultivating a new friendship."

      "content": "Don't let yourself be chased off. There's a chance that a girl with her image and social history may be less open to making new friends. She could be hesitant to open up to you, or try to keep you from getting too close too soon. Don't be put off. Letting her know you like her and want the two of you to get to know each other is about being up front and, most importantly, being persistent. [7] X Research source Don't be easily discouraged. No friendship falls into place right away. It may just be a matter of seeing her a few times and becoming more comfortable in one another's presence. Know when to back off. Though persistence is important, it shouldn't keep you blindly pursuing her if she's just not interested. Try to develop a sense of when enough is enough. If she feels like she's being harassed, it may make her even more closed off."

      "content": "Be a good friend. No matter what your intentions are in getting to know her, the strongest foundation is friendship. The two of you will most likely start off as friends, and you may even find that this is more meaningful to you than dating her would be. Don't try to force her into anything or expect things to move too fast. It's up to her whether she wants the relationship to progress; in the meantime, let your friendship be its own reward. Others may be reluctant to become friends with her based on the way she looks or acts outwardly. Try to see past the \"tough girl\" label and get at the essence of the person inside. We're not all that different at the end of the day."

      "content": "Let her know she can count on you. Become a reliable figure in her life. Always be ready with a helping hand and prove to her that you can be trusted. She can be the most capable person in the world, but it will still mean something to her to know that you care. Make yourself available when she needs you. Be someone that she can talk to. That means being honest and straightforward with her, withholding judgment and making her feel at ease."

      "content": "Tell her what you like about her. No matter how tough or independent she is, no one minds receiving a compliment. Pay attention to more than just her physical features. Single out the best parts of her character and give them the praise they deserve. [8] X Research source Sometimes she might just need to hear that someone else likes the same things about her that she likes about herself. Encourage her individuality, don't make her feel self-conscious about it. Attempts to change her subtly by saying things like \"you shouldn't be such a loner\" or \"see, you look good when you get dressed up\" will only be met with resentment. Lavishing her with too much praise can become tiresome. Say something nice about her when it's warranted; otherwise, it's best not to be too heavy-handed with affection. Make her feel appreciated. This is a much more significant thing than just telling her she's pretty or complimenting her hairstyle. True appreciation stems from recognition of someone's positive qualities and successes, and these are the things you want to celebrate with her."
