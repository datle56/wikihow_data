    {
      "title": "Open the valve cover.",
      "content": "Open the valve cover. Most air mattresses either have a one-way air valve (which allows air to easily enter the mattress, but not leave it) or a simple hole somewhere on the side of the mattress. Locate the cover and remove the protective cap. Some modern air mattresses have pumps built into them on the side. If your mattress has a built-in pump, then it most likely won’t have a valve cover that you need to open."

    {
      "title": "Insert an air pump into the valve.",
      "content": "Insert an air pump into the valve. Most air mattresses come with an electric pump, but you can also use a hand pump or foot pump . Insert the pump's nozzle into the hole or valve opening. Push the pump firmly into the hole so it makes a tight seal with the material around the valve. If it doesn't, there's a chance that air may escape around the pump, making it harder to fully inflate the mattress. [1] X Research source If you’re using a pump that doesn’t get a tight seal around the valve, try wrapping duct tape around the pump nozzle until it stays firmly seated in the valve."

      "title": "Turn on an electric pump to inflate the air mattress.",
      "content": "Turn on an electric pump to inflate the air mattress. Plug in the electric air pump or make sure it has battery power, and then turn it on. The mattress will immediately begin to inflate. Keep it running until the mattress feels firm but gives slightly when you put weight on it. [2] X Research source Inflation time: 3-5 minutes if it’s plugged in, 5-10 minutes if it’s battery-powered Electric pumps are usually quite loud, so avoid running them near where others are sleeping. Be careful not to over-inflate the air mattress because it’s more likely to form leaks. If the mattress is solid and doesn’t flex when you lie down, then let some of the air out."

    {
      "title": "Pump by hand or foot if you’re using a manual pump.",
      "content": "Pump by hand or foot if you’re using a manual pump. If you have an older air mattress or you lost your electric pump, you may only have a manual pump at your disposal. For a hand pump, move the handle up and down to inflate the mattress. With a foot pump, step down on the pedal repeatedly to force air into the mattress. Inflation time: 10-15 minutes"
    },
    {
      "title": "Screw the valve cover back on.",
      "content": "Screw the valve cover back on. Once the mattress is fully inflated and firm to the touch, remove the pump, and then screw the valve or hole cap back on to trap the air inside. Grab some sheets, blankets, and pillows to make your bed and get ready to fall asleep! Air mattresses with one-way valves automatically trap air inside, but it's still a good idea to screw the cap back on to provide another layer of protection against deflation. Mattresses with simple air holes and no valves will immediately begin to deflate as soon as the pump is removed, so screw the cap back on as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Use a hair dryer if there is no pump available.",
      "content": "Use a hair dryer if there is no pump available. If you don't have any pump to inflate your mattress , an electric hair dryer can do the trick. Simply turn the hair dryer on the coldest setting and hold it against the open valve hole to begin filling the mattress. If the hair dryer won't perfectly fit into the air valve, then try cupping your hand around the nozzle to prevent air from leaking out. [3] X Research source Inflation time: 4-5 minutes Be sure to use cool air. Most air mattresses are made from plastic or vinyl, which can sometimes melt or deform if you use a high heat setting."

      "title": "Use a vacuum cleaner or shop vac if it has a “blow” function.",
      "content": "Use a vacuum cleaner or shop vac if it has a “blow” function. Many shop vacuums have a function that blows out air instead of having normal suction. Hold the nozzle up to the air hole or valve, and turn it on to inflate your air mattress. Inflation time: 5-6 minutes If you have an ordinary home vacuum cleaner, remove the bag and connect a long, narrow cleaning nozzle to the hole that the bag was originally attached to. Air will shoot out of this nozzle so you can use it to inflate your mattress. Alternatively, take the air mattress outside and blow into the valve opening with a leaf blower."

      "content": "Use a garbage bag for a cheap alternative. First, open a large garbage bag and swing it up and down to catch plenty of air inside. Hold the bag closed to trap the air. Bring the bag up to your mattress's air hole and hold the open end of the bag around it. Squeeze the bag to force the air out and into the mattress. Refill the bag and continue filling the mattress until it’s full. [4] X Research source Inflation time: 5-10 minutes If you have a choice, use heavy-duty trash bags for this method. Weaker bags are vulnerable to popping under your weight"

      "title": "Use a bike or tire pump.",
      "content": "Use a bike or tire pump. If you've biked or driven to the place where you're using your air mattress, use the pump you brought with you. Use a suitable adapter nozzle to fit into the air mattress’s intake valve. Then, pump the air mattress up the same way that you would for your tires. Inflation time: 10-15 minutes"

      "title": "Inflate the mattress with your breath as a last resort.",
      "content": "Inflate the mattress with your breath as a last resort. If you can't find any objects to help you inflate your mattress, take a deep breath and try the old-fashioned way. Use soap or sanitizer to ensure the mattress's air hole is clean, then simply put your mouth against it and blow air into it. Keep blowing into the mattress until it’s full and firm. Inflation time: 15-30 minutes If you see stars or you feel dizzy, stop and cover the hole so you can catch your breath. If your air mattress doesn't have a one-way valve, keep your mouth pressed into the air hole and close your throat to keep air from blowing back out. Breathe in through your nose instead of using your mouth. Using your breath also introduces moisture to the inside of your mattress, which could cause mold to grow."

      "title": "Refill the air mattress right before you go to bed.",
      "content": "Refill the air mattress right before you go to bed. The first few times you use an air mattress, the material stretches and it may lose some firmness. Check the air mattress before you lie down, and inflate it again if it doesn’t feel firm enough. [5] X Research source Air mattresses are usually completely stretched after 2-3 uses."

      "title": "Avoid excessive weight on the mattress.",
      "content": "Avoid excessive weight on the mattress. Each air mattress has a weight limit, and putting more weight on the mattress could cause it to lose air. Check the weight limit of the air mattress you’re using, and make sure that you stay below the limit so your bed stays inflated through the entire night."

      "title": "Patch any leaks or holes that you find.",
      "content": "Patch any leaks or holes that you find. If your air mattress slowly deflates throughout the night, there may be a leak. To find the leak , wet the surface with soapy water while the mattress is inflated and look where bubbles are forming. Deflate your mattress, and use a [patch kit] to cover the hole . Allow the patch to set for the time listed on the packaging before re-inflating the mattress again. [6] X Research source In a pinch, covering the hole with duct tape, hot glue, or super glue are all good temporary fixes to get you through the night. Mark the leak with a marker so you are able to find it again when you make your repairs."

      "title": "Unscrew the valve cover.",
      "content": "Unscrew the valve cover. When you're done sleeping on your air mattress and want to stow it for storage, unscrew the air hole cover. If your mattress has a simple air hole, it will immediately begin to deflate. However, air mattresses with one-way valves may require slightly more action on your part. If your mattress doesn't immediately start deflating, try one of the following tips: Look for an air-release switch to flip. Turn an air-release mechanism on the valve to let air escape. Unscrew the valve itself from its housing."

      "title": "Fold or roll the mattress to force air out.",
      "content": "Fold or roll the mattress to force air out. As air drains from your mattress, it will eventually settle into a mostly-deflated state. To get all of the air out, start to fold or roll the mattress starting from the end opposite of the air hole. Fold the mattress toward the hole so it takes up minimal space when it's completely deflated. To force absolutely all of the air out of the mattress, try making small, tight folds or rolls like you might do to force toothpaste out of its tube."

      "title": "Use a vacuum to save time.",
      "content": "Use a vacuum to save time. If you'd like to speed up the deflating process, try using a vacuum to quickly pull air out of the mattress. You can use an ordinary home vacuum, a shop vacuum, or any other machine that can create a suction for this purpose. Simply open the air hole, wait for air to begin leaving the mattress, and hold the vacuum hose or nozzle over the hole to speed up the deflation. [7] X Research source"
