      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. You'll need sharp sand (also called concrete sand), Portland cement, and water. [1] X Research source How much of each will depend on how much mud you need. Both sharp sand and Portland cement should be readily available at your local hardware supply store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the cement and sand.",
      "content": "Mix the cement and sand. Mix the cement and the sand together until they're well blended. [2] X Research source Different people will recommend different ratios for mixing (4:1, 5:1, 6:1, and 7:1), but a ratio of 5 parts sand to 1 part cement is the best starting option. \"Stickier\", stronger mud should be made using the 4:1 ratio, but this is difficult to mix."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add in the water.",
      "content": "Add in the water. With the dry ingredients thoroughly mixed add in water slowly until it reaches the right consistency. It should be vaguely damp and stick together when you compress it in your hand. [3] X Research source The consistency will be similar to peanut butter. What type of sand you use and what the environment is like where you live will affect how much water you need to use. Use less if you know that you live in a wet area."

      "title": "Spread and adjust.",
      "content": "Spread and adjust. Spread your mud as needed for your project. Adjust the ratios if you find they don't work for you."

    {
      "title": "Gather your ingredients.",
      "content": "Gather your ingredients. You'll need fuller's earth clay, plain yogurt with live cultures, honey and optionally aloe vera and tea tree oil. The clay may need to be bought online, although you should be able to purchase it from a hardware store. The rest should be available at large grocery stores. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the ingredients.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients. Mix two tablespoons of the clay with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of yogurt, 1 teaspoon of honey, and either 2-3 drops of tea tree oil or 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) aloe vera (depending on if you want these). The tea tree oil is good for fighting acne, the aloe vera for repairing damaged skin."

      "content": "Apply the mask to your face. Wash your face first. Then, with the ingredients completely mixed, use a clean brush (like a paint brush or a cheap makeup brush) to apply it to your face. Be careful not to get it in your eyes."

      "content": "Add the dye to the water. If you're using food coloring to get the brown, dirt look, use equal amounts of red, blue, and yellow food coloring (2 drops of each should suffice). Alternatively, you can add brown acrylic paint instead of food coloring to prevent staining."

      "title": "Mix the cornstarch and water.",
      "content": "Mix the cornstarch and water. Starting with 1-2 cups of cornstarch, mix in the cocoa powder if this is how you're getting the brown color. With those ingredients mixed, or minus the cocoa if using the food coloring, slowly add in water and mix the two together. Stop adding water when you get the magic consistency, where it's hard when you touch it but melts when you don't. [5] X Research source"
