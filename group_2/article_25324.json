      "content": "Listen for laughter. People tend to laugh more when they are attracted to someone. [1] X Research source This doesn't mean that your crush wants to jump your bones just because she laughed at your joke; but you might notice when it's happening a lot."

      "title": "Catch their eyes on you.",
      "content": "Catch their eyes on you. Make a point of looking over at this person at spontaneous moments. If you catch them often staring at you, or even simply stealing glances – there is a good chance that they are interested. People tend to stare intensely for 2-3 seconds at people to whom they're attracted, then lower their eyes and quickly look away. [2] X Research source This person may be trying to subtly flirt with you: looking over frequently in the hopes of catching your eye. Two can play at this game! If your eyes meet, you can react in two ways: look away quickly, to play the coy role, or smile warmly to acknowledge the person."

      "title": "See when someone is listening.",
      "content": "See when someone is listening. If someone cocks their head to the side, it usually means that they are interested in what you have to say. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the person is attracted to you. Attention and attraction do, however, often come hand in hand, and if a person is already listening, you might have a better chance of wooing them with your words."

      "content": "Notice when someone touches you. Subtle (or not-so-subtle) physical contact is a classic way of showing attraction. [3] X Research source See if he/she seems to find excuses to brush your hand or your shoulder, or even just to get close to you. Perhaps they like to jokingly tickle you or perhaps they hug you for just a little bit longer than her other friends. If someone seems to be touching you a lot, there's a good chance that they are attracted to you. [4] X Research source Try touching back. If you like the way that it feels. If it feels electric, real, and right, don't be afraid to reciprocate. This can be a great way to signal that you are attracted, too. [5] X Research source"

Perhaps they volunteer to work an event with you, or to be your lab partner, maybe they show up at every show that your band plays, or they messages you online just to ask \"what's up?\" If someone is actively trying to place themselves within the sphere of your awareness, there's a good chance that it's because they are attracted to you. If this individual is often inviting you to their social plans, that's also a good sign of their interest. However, they may just like you as a friend so keep an eye out for other signs of attraction. Reader Poll: We asked 651 wikiHow readers and only 13% thought that the strongest sign of someone liking you is them inviting you into their plans . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Pick up on \"mirroring.\"",
      "content": "Pick up on \"mirroring.\" People tend to imitate or \"mirror\" the poses and expressions of people to whom they're attracted to. This can take the form of someone subconsciously shifting their legs to sit how you are sitting, slowing their walking speed to match your pace, smiling when you smile, or looking where you look. Most people aren't aware of this impulse when they're acting on it, but you might be able to use this knowledge to speculate on whether someone is attracted to you."

Your crush may make a point of touching your shoulder a lot, or of giving you big hugs. They may also touch a lot of other people in this way. Some people are simply more outwardly affectionate than others, and it can be hard to tell when these people are genuinely attracted to someone. Be careful how much you read into the actions of a very flirtatious person. Be aware that they are likely not only attracted to you. Even if this person has a crush on you, there's a good chance that they encounter other attractive people. Don't be discouraged just because there's a bit of competition! Eventually, you might be able to distinguish this person's \"attraction\" behavior from the way that they act around platonic friends. It may not be what you expect. Some people even clam up and get uncharacteristically shy around those whom they like!"

      "content": "Sense attention. If someone is attracted to you, you should feel the general warmth of this person's attention on you. For example, maybe they talk about sensual things or sensitive things. Maybe they are always asking you how you're doing. It can be a hard thing to intellectualize – sometimes, you may find that you can feel a palpable energy between yourself and another person"

      "content": "Put the clues together. This is no exact science, and attraction usually won't be clear from just one behavior. Use your best judgment. If you caught someone staring at you from across the room, once, then that could mean almost anything. However, if you interact with this person often, and they laugh at your jokes, mirrors your gestures, makes a point to touch you and be near you – you might begin to reasonably assume that he/she is attracted to you. Ask a friend, if you aren't sure. If a friend of yours has seen the two of you together, he/she might be able to give an outsider's perspective on whether the person is attracted to you. Make sure not to ask a mutual friend that might spill the beans! [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Test the waters. If you think that someone likes you, try to find out more. Put your arm around them during a movie to see how they react or give them an extra-long hug and try to gauge their interest; smile slyly back when you catch them staring. Be bold and flirtatious, and you might be able to bring a bit more clarity to the situation."

      "content": "Be confident. If you're pretty sure that this person is attracted to you, then there's a good chance that they like you at least a little bit. It is natural to want to be sure – but at some point, you'll need to make a move. This can take many forms: asking someone out , hooking up with someone, or simply telling someone how you feel . [9] X Research source Do not be forceful, and try not to make too many assumptions. Be respectful, always."

      "title": "Talk to this person.",
      "content": "Talk to this person. Ultimately, direct communication is the surest way to know that someone is attracted to you. If you think that there's a mutual attraction, try to get this person alone for a conversation. Lead in slowly, if you like, or come out and confess your feelings. Kiss the person , if the moment feels right. Talk about your feelings and establish a mutual understanding."

      "content": "Understand the limits of attraction. Someone may well be attracted to you, but that does not necessarily mean that they want to begin a physical or emotional relationship with you. Attraction is a primal sensation. We cannot necessarily control when and whether we feel it, but we can choose where we direct it and how we respond to it. Think carefully about the consequences of acting on mutual attraction. If this person is already in a relationship with someone else, they may have committed to monogamy. Consider whether it is your place to disturb that agreement. The person in question might not be looking for any sort of relationship, period. Know that your attitude toward attraction is not necessarily the same as everyone else's attitude toward attraction."
