      "content": "Cherish your wife above everyone else. Aside from God, your wife should be the most important person in your life, and your relationship should be based on a deep, personal love for each other. In fact, in Ephesians 5:25, the Bible says that you should love your wife the way Christ loved the church, and in Ephesians 5:28, the Bible says that you should love your wife the way you love your own body. It doesn’t get much more intimate than that. [2] X Research source [3] X Expert Source Josh Spurlock, MA, LPC, CST Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. This means that you should know your wife inside and out, so throughout your marriage, pay attention to what she says and does so you can learn as much about her as possible. Embrace everything that makes her unique and special. The Bible also says to love your wife “just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\" -Ephesians 5:25.

      "title": "Work with your wife as a team.",
      "content": "Work with your wife as a team. You and your wife will need to work shoulder-to-shoulder to build a life together, so treat her as your companion and your helpmate. In fact, in Genesis 2:18, the Bible says that God created Eve because Adam needed a \"suitable helper.\" Genesis 2:24 also says: \"That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.\" [5] X Research source In a healthy marriage , you and your partner will enhance each other’s best qualities and help balance out each other’s faults, acting as one solid unit to take on the world. For instance, if you tend to be impatient, you might find that your wife is slower to anger, so you might rely on her in situations where you find yourself waiting. Ecclesiastes 4:9 supports this as well: \"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?”"

      "content": "Show your wife tenderness, even if she makes a mistake. As much as you love your wife, she may occasionally make an error in judgment, be impatient or unkind toward you, or upset you in some other way. However, Colossians 3:19 says, “Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.” Be slow to anger and show your wife forgiveness and love . This will allow her to grow from her mistakes, rather than being haunted by them. [6] X Research source 1 Corinthians 13:4-5 also describes this kind of love: \"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.\" You will need to be humble and apologize if you make a mistake in the relationship, as well."

      "title": "Protect your wife from harm.",
      "content": "Protect your wife from harm. Although your wife is capable of taking care of herself, the Bible still charges you with caring for her. That might mean helping her avoid situations where she might be in danger, or it might mean standing up for her if someone is being unkind. In some cases, you might even protect your wife by making responsible choices for yourself, since she would be affected if you made bad decisions that cost you your livelihood or physical health. [7] X Research source In a healthy, Biblical relationship, your wife will protect you as well. For instance, she may protect your health by reminding you to attend your annual physical, or she may protect your spirituality by encouraging you to spend time with godly friends."

      "content": "Prioritize having an intimate sexual relationship. It’s important to connect with your wife on a physical level. Sometimes that might mean spontaneously stealing a few minutes together before work, while other times you might need to deliberately set aside a special night for romance if you both have busy schedules.

[12] X Research source The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 7:3: ”The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.\" In the same passage, the Bible says, \"Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer.
