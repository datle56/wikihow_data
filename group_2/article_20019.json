Team Magma and Team Aqua will accidentally awake these Pokémon in the Seafloor Cavern after you pass through Sootopolis City for the first time. As long as you play through the story, you won't be able to miss this event. You can have Goldeen learn Waterfall by leveling it up to Level 38, but you'll still need the Rain Badge in order to use it outside of battle to climb waterfalls."
