      "content": "Avoid wearing billowy sleeves while lighting the candles. Keep your outfit in mind when preparing to ignite a set of sparkling candles. While there isn’t a strict dress code for lighting these special items, try not to wear any garment with long, swoopy sleeves that could catch on the flames. Instead, slip on a shirt that fits your arms comfortably without dangling. [1] X Research source If you’re attending a celebration in warm weather, try wearing a T-shirt or tank top instead!"

      "content": "Check that nothing is near the candles that could catch fire. Make sure that the dessert is set away from the edge of a table or counter where it could slip or slide off. Additionally, make sure that there are no tall items or paper products (e.g., napkins, paper towels) that could catch fire from the moving flames on the sparkling candles. [2] X Research source You can always move the cake or other dessert back to a more crowded area after you’ve extinguished the candles."

      "content": "Set aside a small number of candles to use. Don’t go overboard with the number of candles you put into the cake. While it might seem fun to have 20 candles in a single cake, you won’t find it as enjoyable to watch as the sparkling candles burn at different lengths. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Stick the candles into the cake or pastry before lighting them.",
      "content": "Stick the candles into the cake or pastry before lighting them. Place each sparkling candle about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) into the surface of the cake. Try to keep the candles on a flat surface, since the flames will be moving and dancing around. Check that each candle can stand on its own before lighting any of them. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a match to light the candle if you don’t mind being close to the flame.",
      "content": "Use a match to light the candle if you don’t mind being close to the flame. Strike a match and wait for the end of the stick to ignite. Hold the matchstick at a 90-degree angle so the tip can securely reach the wick of the candle. Once the sparkling candle is lit, continue lighting the rest of the candles. If you’re only lighting 1, blow on the match or shake it out to extinguish the flame. [5] X Research source Always hold a match by the very edge of the stick so you don’t burn yourself. Some sparkling candles down have a wick, but a metallic coating instead. Make sure that you’re lightning the candle on the tip of the metallic coating if this is the case."

      "content": "Light the candle with a long-reach lighter to keep a distance from the sparkler. Click the igniter button along the handle of a long-reach lighter and wait for a flame to appear. Continue holding the igniter as you tilt the lighter downwards, keeping the flame on top of the candle. Once the sparkling candle is lit successfully, move the lighter over to the next candle. [6] X Research source Continue holding down the igniter button until all necessary candles are lit."

      "title": "Check that the flames are extinguished before removing the candles.",
      "content": "Check that the flames are extinguished before removing the candles. Be positive that the flame of the sparkling candle is completely out before you start taking out any of the individual candles. Due to the magnesium powder in these candles, they tend to reignite unexpectedly. [8] X Research source"
