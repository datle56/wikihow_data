      "title": "Find some bamboo.",
      "content": "Find some bamboo. If you are lucky, bamboo may already be growing wild in your area, and it is simply a matter of obtaining permission and cutting the bamboo plant to a proper size. If there is no local source, you may be able to purchase a common bamboo pole, used for fishing. You can also often buy bamboo poles of varying sizes at garden supply stores. Make sure your bamboo is thoroughly seasoned and is not split or rotten. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the bamboo into six lengths.",
      "content": "Cut the bamboo into six lengths. Each length should be composed of two of the plant's \"sections\", with one end above the partition-like segment end, and the other below it, so you have an open tube to work with."
    },
    {
      "title": "Split the hollow end",
      "content": "Split the hollow end of each piece. This can be done with a very sharp knife, but care must be used, since both the splinters from the bamboo and the knife can impale or cut you. If you have a vice, it might be easier (and less risky) to fix the bamboo in the vice and cut it with a saw, especially if it is quite tough. Taper the last inch (2.5cm) or so off at an angle.

      "content": "Drill 1/8 inch (3mm) holes just above the section on the solid end of each piece, parallel to the cut you made on the opposite end. This will ensure the hollow, concave bamboo \"channel\" will be facing out on each tube when they are assembled. [3] X Research source"

The string should be about 48 inches (1.2m) long to begin with; any surplus can be cut off after each tube is tied in place. Heavyweight fishing line can be used for hanging the tubes, as in the photos, but a more flexible string will give better results."

Drill three 1/8 inch (3mm) holes spaced equally about the center of this disk, about 3/4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) from the center. Thread the loose ends of your three center strings through these holes, allowing it to hang about 1/4 of the distance down from the top of the bamboo sticks."

This will catch the wind, causing the hammer to strike the bamboo tubes as the wind makes it sway back and forth. One with a larger area will move more in a lighter breeze. Feel free to experiment with different materials in different sizes and weights."
