Keep blowing until the air has inflated the balloon to about 3 in (7.6 cm) from the end, then stop blowing and tie off the balloon . The small “tail” that you leave will become the dog’s actual tail in the end. [1] X Research source Always use balloons specifically made for balloon animals. Qualatex and Betallatex balloons are great for making balloon animals. Always use a balloon pump to inflate your balloons."

Make 2 more twists that are slightly shorter than the first segment to form the dog’s ears. Leave the last segment alone; this will become the dog’s body. [2] X Research source Hold all of the segments in 1 hand to prevent them from becoming untwisted, since they have not yet been locked. You can also make an extra-long snout and call your balloon animal an anteater."

Make 2 more twists below the neck to create 2 segments that are equal in length; these will be the front legs. Hold all the new segments in the same hand to prevent them from coming untwisted. [4] X Research source Would you rather have a giraffe than a dog? Make the neck segment extra long; the rest of the body is exactly the same. You can make the leg segments long or short, but they should be about the same length (otherwise, your dog might not be able to stand up!)."
