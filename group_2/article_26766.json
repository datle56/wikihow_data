      "content": "Obtain organic aloe vera gel from a health or natural medicine shop. Commercially available aloe vera gel is sold in bottles and they come in varying degrees of purity. Many of these commercial products contain additives and chemicals. Since you’ll be using this shampoo directly on your hair and scalp, it’s best to get the purest aloe vera gel you can find. Check the label and ingredients before you buy a product. Make sure it’s certified organic and labelled as “pure.” If it lists any chemical names or alcohol as ingredients, look for a different brand. You can buy aloe vera gel at most grocery stores, but these tend to be the less pure versions. A health or natural medicine shop is the best place to obtain pure aloe vera gel that is certified organic."

      "content": "Harvest aloe vera gel directly from the plant. Harvesting the fresh gel from an aloe plant will provide the most beneficial results. If you don’t grow aloe vera in your home, consider buying a few plants. To harvest the gel, start by cutting off one full leaf from the plant. Slice the leaf open length-wise and pull apart the two halves. Scoop out the thick, translucent gel with a spoon. Spoon the fresh gel into a clean bowl nearby. You only need 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of fresh gel, which you can harvest quickly and easily. It will only take a few aloe vera leaves to provide that amount."

Never use essential oils directly on your scalp, since they are highly concentrated and extremely potent. In this case, the other ingredients in the shampoo will safely dilute the oils."
