      "content": "Five to seven years is generally an acceptable age difference. However, there’s no single right answer here, as it depends on the situation. As long as both partners are consenting adults, there’s nothing preventing you from dating someone significantly older or younger than you are. What’s more important than age is your connection with the other person. That said, relationships in which one person is much older than the other can be judged by those around you, and that can be tough to deal with. [1] X Research source So, is a 10-year age difference too much? Is a 15-year age difference too much? Not necessarily. If you and your partner have shared interests and similar goals, treat each other with kindness and respect, and enjoy your relationship, then don’t let age get in the way of things!"

      "content": "Large age gaps are more acceptable if both parties are older. If one person in the relationship is pretty young, people tend to disapprove. They might think that the older person is taking advantage of the younger person, or that the younger person is in the relationship to get something from the older person—usually money or status. [2] X Research source Can a 25-year-old date an 18-year-old? Legally, yes, but it might not be the best idea. You’re at pretty different stages in your life, which would make things difficult long-term. Additionally, if one person is younger than their mid-20s, their prefrontal cortex isn’t fully developed, and that’s the part of the brain that controls impulses and rational thinking. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Is it OK for an older woman to date a younger man ? Yes! It’s more common to see older men with younger women, but that doesn’t mean that older women can’t date younger men. You might have to deal with some less-than-ideal labeling (i.e. “cougar”), but there’s nothing wrong with dating a younger guy."

      "content": "It’s unacceptable—and usually illegal—to date a minor if you’re an adult. There are laws in place to protect children from sexual exploitation, and dating someone under the age of 18 if you’re older than 18 can result in pretty severe consequences. Large age gaps in teen relationships could be bad for the younger person, as well. For instance, a study showed that younger females with older partners were much more likely to engage in sexual intercourse than young females dating someone closer to their own age, which increases their risk of sexually transmitted infections as well as pregnancy. [4] X Research source In the U.S., the age of consent (when a person can legally consent to sex) is between 16 and 18, depending on the state. [5] X Research source Each state also defines a minimum age—ranging from 10 to 18—which prevents a person from legally consenting to sex if they are at or below that age. Some states also impose an age differential, which is the maximum age difference legally allowed between the two parties if one is younger than the age of consent but older than the minimum age. The age difference ranges from 2 to 5 years, depending on the state."

You may have less in common with someone much younger or older than you are. A study published in the Journal of Population Economics found that the bigger the age difference, the less satisfied the couples were.

You might be going to college and want to have an active social life. Your partner might be settled into their career and less interested in partying on the weekends. When your priorities are different, the relationship might not last. Additionally, if your friends, family, and community aren’t supportive of your relationship, your commitment to the relationship may decrease, making it less likely to succeed. [9] X Research source"

If you’re 42, you can date someone who is 28 or older. This dating rule is not based on science and is thought to be first published in a book in 1901. Take this advice with a grain of salt—the same book also advises men not to marry women who are older, taller, or wealthier than they are. Considering how much society has changed since the early 20th century, this dating rule probably isn’t that relevant. [10] X Research source"

Focus on the issue at hand, rather than bringing up issues from the past, and work together to find a resolution or compromise that you can both live with. [13] X Research source"
