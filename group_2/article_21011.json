      "content": "Show them you have a sense of humor with an extra-cheesy line. There’s nothing that shows your rizz more than dropping a cheesy line with finesse. But if you can pull off one of these extra-cheesy lines, it’s as impressive as hitting a hole-in-one. Remember…no guts, no glory. When you use a line this cheesy , you need to go all in to make it work. Just go for it! “I prefer to keep my game on the fairway, but I’m willing to play in the rough with you.” “I bet you can really handle a club.” “I’m not a professional golfer, but I’d like to try out my short game with you.” “I’m actually pretty good at mini golf.

      "content": "Use a clever line to win their heart and mind. It’s one thing to catch someone’s eye. But if you can impress them with your smarts, you’ll be sharing a drink at the 19th hole in no time! A clever line is also a little easier to transition into a conversation since it’s a little less corny than many pick-up lines. Here are a few clever lines for inspiration…just remember, the cleverest lines reference what’s happening at the moment, so customize them to make them land better. “Are you a golf membership? Because I'm ready to commit.” “Do you have a handicap? Because my game gets weak every time I’m around you. “Are you a birdie?
