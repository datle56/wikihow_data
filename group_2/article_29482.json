      "title": "Examine a few different newspapers.",
      "content": "Examine a few different newspapers. To understand how the basic elements of a newspaper work together, look at how the following elements of each paper come together: Stories - The meat of the paper, where the majority of the text is. Images - Photos and graphics are an essential piece of newspaper design. They break up large swaths of text and help provide context for stories. Headlines - The headline is the first thing the reader will see before deciding whether or not the story is worth their time."

      "content": "Account for printer size. Unless you have access to an industrial-sized printer, your document won't be able to be more than the 8.5-inch-by-11-inch size that most printer paper comes in. This is the default page size setting for Microsoft Word on most computers."

      "title": "Plan your layout before beginning.",
      "content": "Plan your layout before beginning. It will help to have a basic idea of your paper’s design before opening Word and messing with the formatting. Take a few sheets of scratch paper and sketch out a few different designs. Design different pages. The front page will look significantly differently than inside pages, and different sections will have slightly different styles. Draw lines to see how columns will affect the flow of your paper. Too many columns will make your text too crowded, while too few columns will lead to your stories appearing blocky. Try placing text blocks in different places on your scratch page. Wrap text around images, or try placing an image directly above or below the story that it’s related to. Experiment with headline placement. Headlines need to grab the reader’s attention, but they can’t be so large that they’re distracting."
