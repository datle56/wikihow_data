      "content": "Select an unobstructed location on your interior wall to mount the indoor unit. You'll need to cut a hole through the wall to feed the pipes from the indoor unit to the outdoor unit, so make sure the location you choose will allow you to do so. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight and heat sources for the best results. Mount the unit 7 feet (2.1 m) off the floor and ensure there’s at least 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) of open space on every side of the unit to allow for proper airflow. [1] X Research source Choose a location with studs to ensure the wall is strong enough to hold the weight of the unit. Install the unit at least 3.3 feet (1.0 m) away from antennas and power or connecting lines that are used for television, radio, home security systems, intercoms, or telephones. The electrical noise from these sources could cause operational problems for your air conditioner. Avoid locations where gas may leak or where oil mist or sulfur exists. Most of these units have remote controls so that you can easily turn them on or off and adjust the temperature even if they’re mounted high on the wall."

      "content": "Secure the mounting plate to the interior wall. Hold the mounting plate against the wall where you want to install the indoor unit. Use a level to make sure it is both horizontally and vertically level. Use a pencil to mark the locations of the screw holes, remove the plate, then drill a hole into the wall where each screw will go. Position the plate so it matches up with the holes, insert plastic anchors into the holes, and secure the plate to the wall with tapping screws."

      "content": "Drill a 3 in (7.6 cm) hole through the wall so you can feed the pipes outside. Make a mark in the center of the hole in the mounting plate. Use a keyhole saw or a drill with a hole-cutting attachment to create a circular 3 in (7.6 cm) opening through the wall that slopes slightly downward toward the ground to ensure adequate drainage. [2] X Research source Make sure there are no pipes or wires behind the wall before drilling or cutting the hole."

Place the drain pipe on the bottom to ensure a free flow of water. Run the pipes and cable through the hole in the wall, then secure them to the designated spots on the indoor unit as directed by the instruction manual. Each line comes pre-insulated, so you don’t have to worry about adding extra insulation. Do your best to minimize how much the pipes and cable bend to ensure that the unit performs well. Make sure that the drainage pipe allows water to drain in an appropriate place. See the instruction manual included with your kit for more information."

To attach the air conditioner to the wall, simply align the female connections on the back of the unit with the male connections on the mounting plate and press firmly to secure the unit in place. Make sure the unit tilts backward 2-3 degrees so that water can flow out of the drain pipe.

Find the hole you drilled through the mounting plate for the interior unit and position the exterior unit within 50 feet (15 m) so the piping and cable can easily be attached. [4] X Research source Choose a location with at least 12 inches (30 cm) of space surrounding its perimeter to ensure proper functioning. If possible, select a shady location that’s sheltered from the wind in addition to dust and traffic to keep your unit functioning at its best. Make sure that no antenna of a radio or television is within 10 feet (3.0 m) of the outdoor condenser."
