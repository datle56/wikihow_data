      "title": "Don't come on too strong but try to get their attention.",
      "content": "Don't come on too strong but try to get their attention. If the person you have a crush on hasn't noticed you, you might be tempted to just tell them how you feel. If your crush hasn't taken notice of you yet though, this can be creepy. It can also lead them to take you for granted. [1] X Research source Don't stalk your crush. You will seem creepy! To get your crush to notice you, you'll definitely need to be around them sometimes. But, if it seems like you're following them all the time, this can also seem creepy. Make sure when you are around your crush, you are busy with something. You want to look like you have a life of your own, not like you're just hanging around waiting for attention. Try not to seem too needy!"

    {
      "title": "Be outgoing.",
      "content": "Be outgoing. When your crush is around, try to behave like the life of the party. Laugh, talk to others, and be noisy (but not irritating). You want to look like a happy person with an active social life. Be approachable when your crush is around. A lot of people get tense trying to look calm and cool around their crush. Instead of looking calm, they end up looking closed-off. Try to avoid this and look like you're friendly and open to talking."

      "title": "Showcase your talents, but not too much, or they might start to think you're a show-off.",
      "content": "Showcase your talents, but not too much, or they might start to think you're a show-off. Look for an opportunity to show something you're good at in front of the crush. Do you play an instrument well? Look for an opportunity to show your talent when your crush is around! Are you good at baseball? If your crush is around, ask your friends to play catch. It's good to look successful, but you don't want to look full of yourself. You definitely don't want to look mean. Show what you're good at without putting other people down."

    {
      "title": "Use your eyes.",
      "content": "Use your eyes. Sneak some peeks at your crush, but don't stare. You want to let your crush see you've noticed them, but don't just keep gazing at them to get their attention. You want to just glance at your crush, every once in a while, for less than a second."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look (and smell) your best.",
      "content": "Look (and smell) your best. When you know your crush will be around, try to look your best. Wear nice clothes, and keep your hair and nails neat and clean. Choose clothes that you feel confident in, and that you think you look good in. You want to smell nice, too. Keep your body clean. You might want to wear a little perfume or cologne so you have a distinctive smell. Don't overdo it though. Scientific studies show subtle smells are more attractive. In fact, many people find too much perfume very unpleasant."

      "title": "Start a conversation.",
      "content": "Start a conversation. Once you've caught your crush's eye, say hello. Introduce yourself and find something to talk about."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn about your crush.",
      "content": "Learn about your crush. Find out what your crush likes to do. Ask them some questions about their favorite activities. Find out what kinds of music, books, or movies your crush enjoys. This can be great material for a conversation. Everyone likes talking about their own interests. If you know any of your crush's friends, you can also ask them some questions about your crush's interests. Sometimes, having the news that you are asking questions about your crush get back to them can have an added bonus. It can signal that you like them without coming out and saying it.

    {
      "title": "Find a common interest.",
      "content": "Find a common interest. Hopefully, you and your crush like some of the same things. Once you've found out what they like, this should give you some ideas about things to talk about when you are together. It can also give you some ideas for things you might be able to do together. Don't pretend to like things you don't like to impress your crush. This isn't being true to yourself. Also, your crush will find out eventually that you don't actually like or know much about it. This can be embarrassing. For example, if you and your crush have the same favorite band, that can be great material for a conversation. However, if you hate a band and your crush asks you about them, just politely say that you don't like them much. Then bring up something you do like. That way, you don't seem negative, but you aren't pretending to be someone you aren't."

      "content": "Spend time together. Once you've had a chance to chat with your crush a little, look for some opportunities to spend time together. Use your common interests as a way to do this. If you like to draw and your crush is in the art club, you can join too. If you both like baseball, see if your crush wants to go to a game. At first, its probably a good idea to try to spend time with your crush in a situation where other people are around. But once you've had a chance to get to know each other, try asking your crush to do something where it will just be the two of you. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Be positive.",
      "content": "Be positive. Most people enjoy being around people who are positive. So, when you're spending time with your crush, try to be positive and happy. After all, hopefully being around this person makes you feel good. Don't put yourself down. Nobody likes a bragger, but at the same time, you shouldn't belittle yourself. If you want your crush to like you, you should show that you like yourself. If your crush gives you a compliment, say \"thanks!\" Don't complain too much. Everyone has a hard day now and then and needs to blow off a little steam. Mainly though, try to keep your conversations with your crush lighthearted and fun."

      "content": "Make eye contact. Once you start spending time with your crush, you can start sending signals that you like them. This is another place you can let your eyes do the talking. At this point, you should start making eye contact with your crush for a couple of seconds, gaze, and then look away. See if they do it back. Don't keep eye contact for too long. If you are too focused on them and never looking away, it can be creepy."

      "title": "Smile.",
      "content": "Smile. After you make eye contact with your crush, smile to yourself. Don't make it a giant grin; you don't want to seem too excited. But, a little smile lets your crush know you're happy they're paying attention to you, and allows them to be at ease with you."

      "title": "Be yourself.",
      "content": "Be yourself. However you decide to flirt with your crush, it's important to be yourself. Don't pretend to be someone else to please your crush. They'll never truly like you if they don't know the real you. Also, don't try too hard on the flirting. Don't overthink it. Giving your crush tons of compliments, laughing at every joke they make, or constantly trying to bat your eyelashes or strike attractive poses will not seem genuine. No matter how stressful this is, try to just be calm and be your real self."

    {
      "title": "Make contact.",
      "content": "Make contact. After you've gotten to know your crush, if they seem to react well to your flirting, try touching them in a playful way. For example: When your crush makes a joke, laugh, and lightly touch their arm or hand. Another thing is to lightly punch them in the arm. If you are walking past your crush in a hallway or somewhere like that, try lightly brushing your shoulder against theirs. Make it look accidental. Lightly wiggle your fingers on your crush's hand or arm. Stand close to your crush. But, don't make them feel uncomfortable. If they move away, respect their space. Hold your crush's hand to lead them to places. When you're next to your crush, rub your fingers on their wrist to tickle it. Give your crush a hug when saying hello or goodbye. If you think your crush is starting to like you back, kiss their cheek to see their reaction. However, if your crush hasn't shown signs of interest in you, do not try this. If they have shown signs of interest, take the risk and try it when you two are alone."
