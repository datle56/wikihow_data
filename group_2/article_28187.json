It's okay for the slices to touch each other, but make sure they aren’t overcrowded or overlapping. This ensures that they'll toast evenly. [1] X Research source Make sure your bread slices are cut to the same thickness so they'll cook at the same rate. Store-bought slices work very well for this reason, but if you’re slicing a loaf of bread yourself, take extra care to ensure your slices are the same width. [2] X Research source"

To avoid over or under-toasting your bread slices, keep a close eye on them and adjust their cooking time as needed."
