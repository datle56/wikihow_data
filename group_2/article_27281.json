      "title": "Peel the garlic.",
      "content": "Peel the garlic. Use your fingers to peel off the outer layer of skin from the head of garlic. Break up the individual cloves and transfer them to a large metal mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with another metal bowl of the same size. Hold the two bowls together and shake them vigorously for 10 seconds. Remove the top bowl and pick out the peeled garlic cloves. You can also use a large mason jar with a lid if you don’t have two metal mixing bowls of the same size."

      "content": "Process the garlic in a blender. Transfer the peeled garlic cloves to a blender. Add 1 cup (235 ml) of the water and secure the lid on the blender. Puree the mixture until the garlic is finely chopped, about a minute. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a blender, you can use a food processor or immersion blender. Otherwise, chop or mince the garlic with a knife or garlic press and stir it together with the water."

      "title": "Add the remaining water and soap to the blender.",
      "content": "Add the remaining water and soap to the blender. Puree the mixture for an additional minute or so, until the garlic has been liquified. The soap will help the mixture stick to the foliage in the garden, but it also acts as a pesticide in its own right. You can use any liquid soap you like, such as dish or castile soap.

      "title": "Steep the mixture overnight.",
      "content": "Steep the mixture overnight. Transfer the pureed mixture to a clean mason jar and screw on the lid. Leave the mixture on the counter for at least 12 hours, and up to 24. The longer the mixture steeps, the more time the garlic will have to infuse the water with pungent sulfur compounds. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Strain the mixture.",
      "content": "Strain the mixture. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth and position the strainer over a bowl. Pour the mixture into the strainer to remove the chunks of garlic. Give the cheesecloth a gentle squeeze to remove as much of the liquid as possible. Straining the mixture will prevent the garlic from clogging the nozzle on your spray bottle. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Add the water and cayenne to the saucepan.",
      "content": "Add the water and cayenne to the saucepan. You can use red pepper flakes in place of the cayenne, or a fresh hot pepper if you like, such as a jalapeño or habanero. When using a fresh pepper, mince it finely before adding it to the pot. For additional pesticide properties, add three to four fresh or dried mint leaves to the saucepan as well. Mint works as a repellent for ladybugs and other beetles. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave the mixture to steep. With the lid on, allow the garlic, onion, and cayenne mixture to cool for at least 12 hours, and up to 24. This will give the sulfur and oils from the vegetables time to infuse into the water. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Strain the mixture.",
      "content": "Strain the mixture. Pour the cooled mixture into a cheesecloth-lined strainer that’s positioned over a bowl. This will remove the solid pieces of garlic, onion, and pepper, and leave nothing but a sprayable liquid behind. [10] X Research source"

When you spray foliage in the garden with a garlic spray, it will eliminate a number of common garden problems. Garlic can: [12] X Research source Repel aphids, slugs, caterpillars, ladybugs, and other insects Deter deer, rabbits, and other animals that could eat your plants Kill powdery mildew [13] X Research source of water and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of fresh lemon juice and add it to the oil.

Spritz the liquid to cover the tops and bottoms of the leaves with an even coating of spray. Many bugs like to hide on the underside of leaves, and powdery mildew can grow there too. [14] X Research source It’s best to apply the spray in evening, when the sun can't burn the leaves, and when insects tend to be more active."

For the best results, apply a coating of spray every 3 to 5 days (or possibly even daily) until the insects are under control, and once a week thereafter. Reapply after rainfall as well, because the precipitation will wash the spray from the foliage. [15] X Research source"
