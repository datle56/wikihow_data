      "content": "Play individually or as teams, with a non-player host. Traditional Jeopardy! games have three players, but you can make the game work with two. If you’re splitting people into teams in a classroom or organizational setting, create two to four even teams of three to twelve people. Assign someone to be the host—they’ll run the game and read the correct answers. [2] X Research source"

Whether you are creating a Jeopardy! game to use in the classroom, at work, or at home, you’ll have to assign point values when you’re creating the game boards for each round. To make adding points up simple, consider having the values of the five clues per category range from 100 to 500 points in the first round and 200 to 1000 points in the second round.

The highest dice roll or longest straw will be the person or team who goes first. You can also do a coin flip if there are only two players or teams. [4] X Research source In the television quiz show, the returning champion goes first. However, in a home, classroom, or organizational setting, there’s no returning champion. When playing in teams, pick one player from each team that will be responsible for buzzing in to respond."

      "title": "Have the first player pick a category and point value.",
      "content": "Have the first player pick a category and point value. In the first round of traditional Jeopardy!, there are six categories with five clues each. The clues increase by point value (dollar value, on the show) and difficulty. Players can pick any clue on the board by saying, “[Category name] for [point value]” or some variation of that phrase.

      "title": "Have the host read the clue before players respond.",
      "content": "Have the host read the clue before players respond. Players cannot buzz in or otherwise indicate they’re ready to answer until the entire clue has been read aloud by the host. [6] X Research source Once the clue is given, players have a 30-second window to respond. The first player to buzz in is allowed five seconds to provide the correct answer in the form of a question. For example, if the clue is “The place where Santa Claus has his workshop,” an acceptable answer would be, “What is the North Pole?” [7] X Research source Correct answers: If the player or team says the correct answer in the form of a question before their five seconds is up, they are awarded the point value for that clue. They must select the next clue by stating its category and point value on the board. [8] X Research source In traditional Jeopardy!, the host reminds players of the rules if they don’t phrase their answer in the form of a question, but their answer is still accepted in the first round—as long as it’s not a Daily Double clue. [9] X Research source One Jeopardy! show contestant said “What's...?” as the beginning of all his answers. As long as the answer is coherent, this is allowed—the question phrasing does not have to be grammatically correct. [10] X Research source Incorrect answers: If the player or team says the incorrect answer, the host will inform them verbally or play a sound that indicates they’re wrong. The point value of the clue will be deducted from their score. After an incorrect answer, if the 30 seconds are not up, other teams have the opportunity to buzz in and ‘steal’ or guess the correct answer (as a question). Once they buzz in, they have five seconds to answer. If they give an incorrect answer, the point value of the clue is deducted from their score also. [11] X Research source No answers: If the first player or team to buzz in doesn’t say an answer before their five seconds expire, others can buzz in and guess. If no one attempts to guess the answer after 30 seconds, the host can read the correct answer. No points will be deducted or earned. [12] X Research source Daily Double: In traditional Jeopardy!, one Daily Double clue is hidden in the first round. If the selected clue is a Daily Double, only the player or team that chose it can answer. Before seeing the clue, they must wager an amount between five and their total current score. The host decides how much time they have to respond—10 to 15 seconds is a good average. [13] X Research source If they give the correct answer in the form of a question before time is up, the amount they wagered is added to their score. They pick the next clue from the board. If they give an incorrect answer or let time run out, the amount they wagered is deducted from their score. They will select the next clue from the board."

      "content": "Continue this cycle until all clues are answered or time is up. When playing in a school or organizational setting, you’re likely operating under a time constraint. Your first Jeopardy! round may last between five and fifteen minutes, erring on the longer side if you’re playing with teams. When playing with teams, consider letting players have more than five seconds to respond to a clue so everyone on the team has a chance to guess. If you’re practicing to become a contestant , try to follow the show’s timing as closely as you can. The show doesn’t have an exact time limit for rounds, but if you don’t get through all the clues before you need to move on, that’s okay."

There are also two Daily Doubles hidden in the board instead of one. [14] X Research source The player or team with the lowest score at the start of the Double Jeopardy! Round selects the first clue. If two players are tied, the player with the last correct answer between the tied players gets to select the first clue. [15] X Research source"

Otherwise, you or your team are automatically eliminated from the game and receive last place.

If multiple players have the same negative score or zero scores, last place goes to the player who had the lower score at the start of the Double Jeopardy! Round. If all players are in the negative going into Final Jeopardy!, no Final Jeopardy! round is played. Use the scores going into Double Jeopardy! to determine the winner. [17] X Research source"

Once the host reads it, players or teams can decide what amount they want to wager between zero and their total current score. They have five minutes to write down a wager which they must hide from other players or teams. [18] X Research source The host can pass out whiteboards and markers, or index cards and pens, for players to write their wagers on. Make sure the paper they have is big enough for them to write their guess, too. In traditional Jeopardy!, players use the wager period to write the question phrasing of their answer, either “Who” or “What.”"

A correct answer allows their wager to be added to their total score; an incorrect answer will deduct their wager from their score. Only reveal the correct answer when confirming a correct answer.

In the event of a tie for first place, the host will present a new category and read a clue. The first player to buzz in and respond correctly wins the game. [20] X Research source If neither tied player is correct when responding to a tie-breaker clue, the host will present a new category and clue until one of the tied players responds correctly and wins the game. If every player is reduced to zero after Final Jeopardy!, use the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round to determine the winner."
