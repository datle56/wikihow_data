      "content": "Rinse the rice in cold water. Before boiling white rice, it’s a good idea to rinse it. That removes any dusty starch that might be on the rice so it doesn’t stick together when it cooks. Place 1 cup (195 g) medium- or long-grain white rice in a strainer, and rinse it under cold running water. [1] X Research source Rinsing the rice isn’t always necessary. Some rice may have more starch on it than others, though, so you may just want to get in the habit of doing it with every batch that you boil."

      "title": "Bring the water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil. Add 2 cups (470 ml) of water to a small saucepan, and place it on the stove at medium-high to high heat. Allow the water to heat until it comes to a roiling boil. [2] X Research source When you’re making white rice, use a use a 1:2 ratio for the rice and water. That means for every 1 cup of rice you plan to make, use 2 cups of water. As it cooks, rice expands so it’s important to use a pan that’s large enough for the amount that you’re making. In general, a 2-quart (2.5 L) pan is large enough for 1 to 2 cups of uncooked rice."

      "title": "Add the rice and salt to the pot.",
      "content": "Add the rice and salt to the pot. Once the water comes to a boil, add the rice and ½ teaspoon of (2.84 g) salt and stir gently. Allow the pot to come to a gentle simmer. [3] X Research source You can also add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter or oil to flavor the rice and keep it from sticking together as it cooks. Follow the instructions on the package because it may be different for various kinds of rice and recipes. If you cook one and a half cups of rice with three cups of water, you can bring it to a boil and turn it off. Do not remove the lid. There will be fewer chances of overcooking the rice. If you use more than three cups of water, you may need to let it simmer for a while."

    {
      "title": "Cover the pot and cook until the rice is tender.",
      "content": "Cover the pot and cook until the rice is tender. After the pot reaches a simmer, turn the burner’s heat down to low, and cover the pot with its lid. Allow the rice to cook for approximately 18 minutes. At that point, start checking its texture. When the rice is finished, it will be firm but not crunchy. You want it to be tender, so it’s okay if it’s somewhat sticky. However, make sure that you don’t cook it so long that it becomes gummy. [4] X Research source Don’t take the lid off the pot before the 18 minute mark. It helps trap steam that aids in the cooking process, so if you remove the lid, it may take longer for the rice to finish. If you don’t have a lid for your pot, use foil to cover it while the rice cooks. Just make sure to cinch the foil around the edges so the steam can’t escape. If there’s still water left in the pot when the rice is finished cooking, you should drain it. Just tilt it over the sink to allow the excess water to drip out."

Transfer the rice to a bowl or individual plates and serve. [6] X Research source It’s a good idea to allow the rice to sit for another 2 to 3 minutes after fluffing before you serve it. That gives it some time to dry out so it’s not too wet and sticky when you serve it."

      "content": "Rinse the rice in cool water. Just as with white rice, it helps to give brown rice a rinse before boiling it. That helps remove any dust and grit that may be clinging to it. Place 1 cup (190 g) medium- or long-grain brown rice in a strainer or colander and rinse it under cool water. [7] X Research source Rinsing the rice before cooking can also improve its texture, so each grain is distinct and doesn’t stick to the others."

      "title": "Toast the rice in a pot.",
      "content": "Toast the rice in a pot. To bring out the nutty flavor of brown rice, you should toast it before boiling it. Place a 2-quart (2.5 L) pan on the stove, and heat 1 teaspoon (5 ml) olive oil or sesame oil in it over medium-high heat. Add the rice to the pan, and toast it until the rice is completely dry and the ends begin to look lightly toasted. [8] X Research source You can also tell when the rice is finished toasting when it begins to give off a nutty aroma."

After the pot comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and allow it to reduce to a bare simmer before covering it with a lid. [10] X Research source Make sure not to cover the pot until the contents stop boiling completely."

At the end of the cooking time, uncover the pot and look to see if the rice has absorbed all of the water. Test the rice to see if it’s no longer crunchy too. It should be tender but slightly chewy when it’s done. [11] X Research source During the 45 minute cooking period, don’t uncover the pot. That will cause steam to escape, and the rice will need longer to cook. It’s okay if there’s a little water at the bottom of the pot when you check it after 45 minutes. If there’s more than 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water, though, drain the excess into the sink. If the rice is still crunchy after 45 minutes, pour a bit more water if necessary into the pot and allow the rice to cook longer. Be sure to check on it in 10 minute intervals, though, until the rice is tender."

Allow it to sit for approximately 10 to 15 minutes in the covered pot to get rid of some of its stickiness. [12] X Research source Allowing the rice to sit also helps it dry a little so it doesn’t seem as wet and freshly steamed when you serve it."

Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl full of cold water and soak it for 30 minutes to an hour before draining it well. [14] X Research source Soaking the rice isn’t entirely necessary, but it helps make the rice softer once it’s cooked."

Add a pinch of salt, and then pour 3 cups (705 ml) boiling water over the rice. [15] X Research source If you don’t have a lid for your pot, don’t worry. You can set a cookie sheet that’s large enough to cover it on top when the times comes. You can add as much salt as you like to taste. In most cases, ⅛ teaspoon (0.7 g) for each cup of rice is usually sufficient."
