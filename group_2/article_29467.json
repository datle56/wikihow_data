Re-pin the to fabric pieces.[ Choose a soft fabric, such as flannel or fleece. Jersey or cotton ill also work. You can use the same color and pattern for both sides, or coordinating ones.

      "content": "Sew the pillow, but leave a small gap for turning and filling. Begin and finish sewing at one of the side edges, leaving a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) gap. Use a matching thread color and a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. [3] X Research source Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. This will keep your stitches strong and prevent them from unraveling."

[5] X Research source If you want to use this as a therapeutic pillow, you can stuff it with rice instead; this way, you can heat it up in the microwave, then drape it around your neck.

Shake the pillow between each interval to distribute the heat evenly."
