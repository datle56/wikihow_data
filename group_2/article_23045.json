      "content": "Experts recommend spending around $500 for a quality suit. The $500 range will give you everything you need in a basic suit: quality stitching, nice fabric, and neutral, versatile colors. It isn’t the cheapest suit you can get, but it’s definitely not the most expensive, either. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Expect to spend $400 to $799 on a basic suit.",
      "content": "Expect to spend $400 to $799 on a basic suit. Basic suits are perfect for almost any occasion: a job interview, a wedding, or even a professional event. Suits in this price range are great to have on-hand at any age, and they’re also the perfect suit to splurge on if you’ve never purchased one before. [2] X Research source While most basic suits start at $400, you can often find them on sale for as little as $300. Most experts agree that you should buy the best quality suit that you can afford."

      "title": "Look for a wool / polyester blend suit.",
      "content": "Look for a wool / polyester blend suit. Basic suits are usually made of wool, and some are a blend of fabrics, too. Depending on where you purchase from, you may be able to find Italian wool or even English wool available. [3] X Research source Wool absorbs moisture and wicks it away, allowing the fabric to “breathe.” Most suits are made of wool because it helps them stay clean longer and last for decades. In this price range, the lining of the suit is typically rayon or polyester."

    {
      "title": "Go for a blue or medium gray suit.",
      "content": "Go for a blue or medium gray suit. Like their name suggests, basic suits typically come in basic colors: blue, gray, and black are very common. If you’d like a more versatile suit, opt for a charcoal gray or a navy blue so you can wear it to multiple occasions. [4] X Research source For your first suit, stay away from patterns or pinstripes. Since this suit is supposed to be versatile, you don’t want it to be too flashy. You can add pops of color to a neutral-colored suit with your pocket square. If you’re going to a funeral, opt for a black suit instead."

    {
      "title": "Pay a little extra to get your suit tailored.",
      "content": "Pay a little extra to get your suit tailored. Even the cheapest suit can look great if it fits you well. At most department stores, you can usually pay $20 to $50 more for tailoring so your suit fits you correctly. Have the tailor take your measurements, then try on your suit again once it’s been altered. Most basic suits are “off the rack,” meaning they’ve been mass-produced to fit general size guidelines. Odds are, an off the rack suit won’t fit perfectly without some alterations."

    {
      "title": "Set aside $800 to $1,500 for a mid-level suit.",
      "content": "Set aside $800 to $1,500 for a mid-level suit. Around $800 is when suits start becoming more high quality. You can still find some suits off the rack at this point, but oftentimes, they’ll be made-to-measure or bespoke, meaning the suit is custom-made for you. [5] X Research source At this price range, you’ll typically be measured before trying on a suit, and you can specify the color, fabric, and lining that you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a wool, silk, and linen blend.",
      "content": "Look for a wool, silk, and linen blend. Suits in this price range don’t contain any synthetic fabrics; instead, they’re typically a mixture of 2 to 3 high-end natural fabrics. Typical suits are a blend of wool, silk, and linen, but you can find 100% wool or 100% linen suits if you’d prefer. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim for a half-canvas lining.",
      "content": "Aim for a half-canvas lining. The “canvas” is the layer in between the suit and the lining inside. Typically, mid-level suits will have a half-canvas, meaning the liner is only in the top portion of the jacket. The half-canvas helps the suit hold its shape while conforming to your body, which will make it fit much better. [7] X Research source At this price point, the canvas is usually glued in rather than sewn in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for high-quality stitching.",
      "content": "Check for high-quality stitching. While most suits are machine-stitched, a suit at this price point should look high quality and almost hand-done. If you notice any imperfections or loose threads, ask to see a different suit, since that one is probably not worth the money. [8] X Research source Most suits in this price range are made in countries like Italy or England. However, it depends a lot on where you’re shopping."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try out a pattern or new color.",
      "content": "Try out a pattern or new color. If this isn’t your first rodeo, it may be time to step up your suit game just a little. Go for a pinstripe or a plaid suit, and check out the fun colors, too. Now’s your chance to buy a suit that will make you stand out, and one that isn’t quite so versatile. [9] X Research source Of course, you can always stick to neutral colors, like blue, black, or gray."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get the suit fitted to your body.",
      "content": "Get the suit fitted to your body. At this price range, you can typically expect multiple rounds of fittings to make sure that the suit is tailored to your body. If anything needs to be altered, don’t be afraid to speak up—the tailor wants to make sure you love your suit when you walk out that door. [10] X Research source Tailoring a suit in this price range will typically take around 1 to 2 months."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spend $1,500+ for a high-end suit.",
      "content": "Spend $1,500+ for a high-end suit. Once you spend $1,500 or more on a suit, it’s going to be custom-made for you with the highest quality fabrics. Suits like these are for people who want to make a statement, and who aren’t afraid to spend the money to do so. [11] X Research source This price range is usually for people who need to wear suits every day for their job. This isn’t necessarily a suit for a one-time event, it’s a suit that can be worn daily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get your measurements taken for a bespoke suit.",
      "content": "Get your measurements taken for a bespoke suit. Bespoke suits are totally unique to you: unlike made-to-measure suits, the tailor isn’t working from a pre-made pattern. Instead, they will take your measurements and draft the suit from scratch to fully fit your needs and your body. [12] X Research source A bespoke suit often takes upwards of 2 months to complete fully. If you’re looking for a bespoke suit, get the process started sooner rather than later."

    {
      "title": "Talk to the tailor about your wants and needs.",
      "content": "Talk to the tailor about your wants and needs. Since this suit is custom-made for you, you can have an in-depth conversation about what you’re looking for in a suit. Tell your tailor about the look and feel of what you want, and where you’ll be wearing your suit. They’ll be able to guide you to the fabric, color, and pattern that you need. [13] X Research source They may also have some guidance for you on the style of suit. Single breasted vs. double breasted, shawl lapel vs. notch lapel, and modern fit vs. classic fit are all decisions that you and your tailor can make. If you’re going for a double breasted suit, wear something fitted and tailored underneath to avoid looking bulky."

    {
      "title": "Look for a suit made from natural materials.",
      "content": "Look for a suit made from natural materials. Like mid-level suits, you’ll never find a high-end suit with a synthetic fabric blend. Instead, go for a suit made from wool, linen, silk, cotton, or some combination of those fabrics. [14] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy a full-canvas suit.",
      "content": "Buy a full-canvas suit. The canvas is the material in between the lining and the fabric of your suit. In high-end suits, the canvas typically covers the entirety of the jacket, and it’s sewn, not glued, in. [15] X Research source The canvas helps the suit hold its shape and last longer."

    {
      "title": "Check for high-quality stitching and handmade buttonholes.",
      "content": "Check for high-quality stitching and handmade buttonholes. Most of your suit will still be machine stitched, but in high-end suits, the buttonholes are typically sewn by hand. These hand-sewn buttonholes are sharp and sleek, and they look much more expensive than ones that have been made by a machine. [16] X Research source It can take up to 45 minutes for a tailor to hand-sew 1 buttonhole."

      "title": "Expensive suits are nice, but don’t break the bank trying to buy one.",
      "content": "Expensive suits are nice, but don’t break the bank trying to buy one. Most experts agree that you should spend what you can afford instead of over-extending yourself for a high-end suit. Basic suits and mid-level suits are still great suits, and no one’s going to judge you if you show up in a $500 suit for a job interview or your first day of work. [17] X Research source"
