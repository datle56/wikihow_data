Place your thumb under the cat's jaw, and your forefinger on their forehead. The cat's head should now be held in your hand. Hold the cat's head gently and twist your wrist so that the nose is rotated upward to point towards the ceiling.

      "content": "Squeeze the bottle. Holding the dropper bottle between your finger and thumb, invert the bottle such that the dropper is pointing towards the floor. Give the bottle a gentle squeeze until a drop of liquid appears at the end of the nozzle. Maintain this pressure and position the dropper nipple as close to the cat's nostril as possible. Once you are happy with the position of the bottle, squeeze the bottle until the required number of drops are dispensed into the cat's nostril."

      "title": "Bring the bottle a little closer.",
      "content": "Bring the bottle a little closer. The exact distance of the dropper nipple is not crucial, but the closer you are to the nose the more likely it is that the drop will go into the nostril. In an ideal world, you should touch the nipple to the nostril, but some cats will flinch away when they feel the bottle’s touch, which will make you lose the positioning of your bottle. Try to hold the bottle so that it hovers about two to three millimeters above the entrance to your cat’s nostril so that the drop is most likely to go in."

      "content": "Understand why it is important to restrain your cat. When your cat with faced with an unknown substance, such as nose drops, they may become skittish, which is why they will need to be restrained. However, keep in mind that you should always be gentle with your cat; do not shout at them or scold them, even if they do not cooperate. If you act gently and compassionately, your cat may still be unhappy, but will be less likely to run away from the medication in the future."

      "content": "Gather everything you need. Whether you choose to use an assistant or simply tackle the matter yourself, you will need several items before you can begin. It helps to gather these items before you begin the drop-applying process so that the process can run more smoothly. You will need: A table: Working at a table will make giving your cat the nose drops much easier. Protect the surface of the table from scratching claws with a thick towel. Good lighting : The cat's nose is small and you will need good lighting to see where to position the nozzle of the drops. Nose drops: Read the label and keep store them correctly; many drops need to be stored at 28 °C (82 °F) and away from light. When it is time to administer the drops, have them within hand's reach and remove the lid in anticipation of application. A large towel: A towel is handy for method one (two people) if you cat tends to strike out and scratch. The towel is essential for method two (one person) because you need it to wrap the cat up."

      "content": "Understand that this method of restraint requires two people. You will need an assistant to hold the cat while you administer the drops. This method is generally a little less stressful for your cat, and allows you to have both hands free to administer the drops efficiently. This is generally the preferred method for medicating an aggressive cat. The disadvantage is that it is not always easy to have two people available at the same time the cat is around to give them their medication."

      "content": "Get your assistant to restrain the cat by standing behind them and placing one hand on each of the cat's arms, just below the elbow (left hand to left arm, right hand to right shoulder). Curl the fingers around the arm so as to maintain a firm grip on the front legs, sufficient to stop the cat from lifting a leg or swiping at you. [2] X Research source The Anatomy of Domestic Animals, 5th Edition, Sisson and Grossman, WB Saunders Co., Philadelphia, 1975. It also helps to steady the cat if the assistant presses inwards with their forearms so that they lie pressed along the cat's chest and rump. This stops the cat from wriggling side-to-side. With a particularly wriggly cat, the assistant should lean over the cat and use his chest pressed over the cat's back to stop her from jumping upwards. Thus confined the cat cannot run forwards (the hands of the arms stop this), wriggle sideways (the forearms act as restraining bars) or up (the assistant's chest stops this) but their head is free and facing outwards. Note: If the cat is particularly spiteful and determined to lash out, you may need to wrap the cat in a towel (see the next method) and then have the assistant hold the cat."

Place the cat centrally on the towel, at a right-angle to the length, with their nose touching one edge. Let the cat rest on their belly in a natural crouching position, with their paws underneath. There should be an equal length of towel on either side of the cat’s body."

Now when you lower their back end down, their body weight pins the towel beneath them and there is no backwards escape route."
