[1] X Expert Source Souad Gharib Exercise & Wellness Specialist Expert Interview. 8 June 2021. To start, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold two dumbbells at your sides. [2] X Research source Choose a weight you feel comfortable with for the dumbbells. If you're just starting out doing squats, you will probably need to start with a lightweight, like something in the 2 to 5-pound range. Talk to a trainer at a gym, or your doctor, to figure out a safe weight for you. Pull your back up straight as you tighten your core. Bend your knees to lower your body. Take a quick look at the tops of your shoes when you are at the bottom of the range of motion. You must be able to see the tops of your shoes, or this means that your knees are coming too far forward in the squat. Keep lowering your body until your thighs are roughly parallel to the floor. Then, return to the starting position. You should repeat this exercise 10 to 12 times."

Keep your elbows under your shoulders and clasp your hands together just under your chin. Prop yourself up to form a bridge with your body running from your shoulders to your toes. Support your weight with only your toes and forearms on the ground, squeezing the muscles of your chest, abdominals, lower back, buttocks, and legs. Hold this position for 10 seconds when you're first starting. Eventually, you will want to build yourself up to 3-minute planks."

Talk to a doctor or trainer about a safe weight for you. If you feel like you need more resistance, then you can try holding a dumbbell just above your knee as you lift. This is a good way of increasing resistance without risking injury to your knee."

High-waisted clothing, like high-waisted jeans and skirts, can make your hips look bigger by slimming down your waist. In the winter, choose flattering sweaters that call attention to your figure. Avoid hiding your shape in bulky layers. You can also try wearing shapewear, such as Spanx, underneath your clothing to make your waist look smaller."

For example, if you have a carrot-shaped body, then this may have the opposite effect and make your hips seem even narrower. Wear pastels in places you want to emphasize, such as your hips, and wear black in places you want to slim down, such as your waist. For example, a light blue skirt with a black top will emphasize your hips and slim your waist."
