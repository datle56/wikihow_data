      "content": "No, \"freaking\" is not a swear word, but it still offends some people. \"Freaking\" is an adjective that emphasizes the word it describes. It's almost more of a slang word than a curse word, and a PG-rated alternative to the F-word . It's a safer, less offensive way to make a statement sound more forceful—but some people may still find it impolite or inappropriate depending on the context. [1] X Research source \"I freaking hate this movie. It's so freaking stupid.\" \"I freaking love Taylor Swift! Her songs are so freaking amazing!\""

      "content": "\"Freaking\" can be a positive or negative word based on context. For example, if the speaker complains about someone and says, \"That freaking guy!\" and rolls their eyes, that's an insult. If the speaker praises someone and says, \"They're so freaking talented!\" and smiles, that's a compliment. [2] X Research source Basically, \"freaking\" just amplifies the feelings someone has about what they're talking about, whether those feelings are positive or negative."

[5] X Research source Be aware that some people may think you're prudish or overly cautious if you substitute \"f*cking\" with \"freaking.\" If it would bother you to be regarded in that way, consider avoiding \"f*ck\" substitutes altogether."

Find out if it's a taboo word in your household before you start throwing it around and get in trouble.
