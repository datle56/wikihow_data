      "title": "Don’t scream.",
      "content": "Don’t scream. If your dogs get into a fight, your initial reaction may be to yank on their leashes, scream their names, and yell “No!” Unfortunately, your dogs are worked up, won’t be listening for that command, and your screaming will only stress and excite your dogs further. During a fight, your dogs are vulnerable and will only hear you yelling, not what you are yelling. [1] X Research source Use a firm, loud command, such as “Away!” Grunt at your dogs – the sound is unfamiliar to them and also primal. It may catch their attention. Keep in mind that dogs may act aggressively out of fear, and yelling or screaming may only intensify their fear."

      "title": "Make a loud noise.",
      "content": "Make a loud noise. Sometimes a loud noise is enough to distract the dogs out of fighting. When you’re out with your dogs, carry a whistle or other loud, easily accessible noisemaker. If your dogs engage in aggressive posturing with one another, another dog, or begin fighting, use your noise-making device to startle the dogs away from one another. [2] X Expert Source Colleen Demling-Riley, CPDT-KA, CBCC-KA, CDBC Canine Behavior Consultant Expert Interview. 25 March 2022. If your dogs are prone to aggression, consider carrying an air horn."

      "title": "Spray the dogs.",
      "content": "Spray the dogs. If you’re away from your house, carry a spray bottle with you. Some people fill the bottle with water, some with a vinegar and water solution, and some people fill the bottle with water and a few drops of citronella oil. Vinegar and citronella are unpleasant smells to a dog’s sensitive nose. Just as with sound, spraying the dogs should provide enough of a distraction to get the dogs to back away from one another. If you’re home, spray the dogs with a garden hose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a leash.",
      "content": "Use a leash. When dogs fight, they are hard to separate. Don’t put any part of your body near their mouths, as they will likely not distinguish your hand or leg from the other dog. Instead, if you are comfortable, get a leash and form a loop between the hook and handle. Toss the loop around the hindquarters of one of the dogs, creating a sort of sling, and slowly drag the dog at least 20 feet away. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source The other dog should stop fighting when it sees its opponent move away. The dog you’re dragging may twist and continue to snarl. Keep your body a safe distance away from the dog. Let them fight. You might not be able to safely break up a fight between two dogs. Your only option may be to let them fight, as much as you don’t want to do so. There are times, though, that the aggression is too high or you’re not in a position to help, as much as you want to, and the dogs will have to sort it out themselves. [5] X Research source This is a last resort, as there are ways to intervene without putting yourself in physical harm."

    {
      "title": "Watch the eyes.",
      "content": "Watch the eyes. One of the first signs that one of your dogs is uncomfortable is a targeted, unwavering stare at your other dog. This means that they are intently watching every non-verbal cue that the other dog is giving. In response, they will either lose interest and look away or become increasingly uncomfortable, and possibly more aggressive. [6] X Research source You may have heard that if a dog breaks eye contact that they are submitting to you or another dog. Don’t rely on this advice. Until your dog fully appears to have lost interest, assume that they are still paying close attention to the other dog. If the other dog returns a sustained stare, you should assume that tensions are mounting quickly and separate the dogs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to posture.",
      "content": "Pay attention to posture. Dogs, like other animals, do quite a bit of posturing when they are feeling threatened or challenged. If you notice either dog standing firmly in place, especially if they pull their neck back such that their head is over their shoulders, the dogs are posturing and should be separated. [7] X Research source Some dogs may drop their head low and bare their teeth. This is another form of posturing and indicates that a dog is ready to fight. You may see one dog mount another. This is not sexual; rather, it’s a behavior to establish dominance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the body language.",
      "content": "Look at the body language. If you see either dog’s movements become stiff or extreme, such as pulling their lips back or holding their head high or low, or even erratic movements, the dog is communicating a warning. Safely remove your dog to deescalate the situation. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to the growls.",
      "content": "Listen to the growls. Dogs communicate with one another through a combination of non-verbal and verbal communication, such as growling and barking. Listen to how your dogs interacts with people, other dogs, strangers, odd noises, and you will have a pretty good idea what they are talking about. This is helpful in identifying their aggressive growl. Older dogs will growl at younger dogs to help the younger dog recognize their position in the social hierarchy. If you hear your dog growl, pay attention to its other physical signals, which should help you identify if your dog is prepared to fight or is simply vocalizing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t make assumptions.",
      "content": "Don’t make assumptions. Your dogs may be even tempered or even typically quite relaxed. Do not assume that your dogs are not capable of fighting because of their mild demeanor, though. If your dogs have a bad interaction with one another, there is the potential for them to fight to sort out the problem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recognize your dogs’ stressors.",
      "content": "Recognize your dogs’ stressors. Dogs usually fight because they are stressed. The dog isn’t normally aggressive, but when stressed, its demeanor changes, just like with humans. Dogs are sensitive to their surroundings and my get stressed over simple, seemingly innocent things. Being aware of your dogs’ stressors will help you minimize the potential for a fight. Some stressors to look out for: [9] X Research source A treat or food bit that your dog is interested in Bad weather or ongoing inclement weather Loud noises Humans being emotional or arguing Dog’s normal routine is off Not getting exercised enough"

    {
      "title": "Be aware of your dogs’ triggers.",
      "content": "Be aware of your dogs’ triggers. All animals have triggers, or things that immediately make them uncomfortable and defensive. Knowing your dogs’ triggers is helpful because you can avoid them, when possible, and also help your dog, with training, become desensitized to some unavoidable triggers. [10] X Research source Some triggers include: One dog refusing to defer to the other. This is problematic because dogs operate in a social hierarchy at all times. Pain – dogs are great at hiding their pain and may react aggressively when approached by another dog. Protection – if your dog thinks that you’re in danger, it may act aggressively to protect you, fighting dogs (or humans) that it sees as a threat."

    {
      "title": "Remember that some posturing is normal.",
      "content": "Remember that some posturing is normal. Dogs work out who falls where on the social ladder pretty quickly. Sometimes, they might tussle a little to help them sort it all out. This isn’t encouraged, but it is normal. Posturing is different than acting aggressively. Posturing might include bouncing on the front feet a few times, a small, slight growl, or an attempt to herd the other animal to a different location. Posturing doesn’t include bared teeth, snarling, biting, or other overtly aggressive actions."

    {
      "title": "Train your dogs.",
      "content": "Train your dogs. Training your dogs is important because it establishes clear behavior expectations between you and your pets. It also allows you and your dogs to communicate more effectively with one another. Training your dogs puts you higher on the social hierarchy than them, meaning it should defer to you when it is stressed or encounters a trigger. [11] X Research source Ideally, your dogs will respond to your verbal or visual commands and immediately cease any aggressive behavior or fighting. Teach your dogs the “look” command to use as a distraction technique. This command teaches the dog to look at you when you say “look.” Using this command will provide a temporary distraction from the other dog and help to defuse the tension."

    {
      "title": "Socialize your dogs.",
      "content": "Socialize your dogs. Dogs who are well socialized with other dogs and humans will not be as prone to fighting because they will not view people and dogs as stressors. It’s important to start socializing your dogs as soon as they’re vaccinated, and continue that socialization throughout their lives. [12] X Expert Source Colleen Demling-Riley, CPDT-KA, CBCC-KA, CDBC Canine Behavior Consultant Expert Interview. 25 March 2022. Many cities have dog parks which are parks with enclosures specifically for dogs to run and play off leash. Some pet stores allow dog owners to bring their leashed or harnessed dogs in while they shop. Consider taking your dogs for walks around your neighborhood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed them separately.",
      "content": "Feed them separately. Food is a big stressor for dogs. Don’t force your two dogs to eat side-by-side or even in the same room or at the same time. Instead, allow your dogs sufficient space to eat their meals so that they aren’t feeling stressed or threatened. If your dogs fight at mealtime, you might consider separating them with a baby gate or even feeding them in separate rooms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t give out special treats.",
      "content": "Don’t give out special treats. Treats can be a great training reward and are nice to give to your dogs in moderation. If your dogs are prone to fighting, avoid giving them special treats like pig ears, rawhides, meat chunks, bully sticks, or real animal bones and knuckles. These might be considered too special or prized and lead to immediate aggression or fighting. If you do want to give extra special treats like these, separate your dogs or give them the treats in their crates."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid letting your dogs walk head on towards each other.",
      "content": "Avoid letting your dogs walk head on towards each other. If one of your dogs walks in a straight line towards the other, then this can be seen as a threat. To avoid potential conflict from this, try to walk your dog in an arc around the other dog. You may need to put one dog on a leash to accomplish this or grab him by the collar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seek help from a trained animal behaviorist.",
      "content": "Seek help from a trained animal behaviorist. A trained animal behaviorist can help by providing training, guidance, and information about how to help your dogs get along with each other. They can also identify trigger factors and any role you might unintentionally play in the conflict between your two dogs. Ask your veterinarian for a referral to an animal behaviorist and set up an appointment. Ask the animal behaviorist about having one of your dogs desexed. Having both dogs desexed may not solve the problem, and having the aggressor desexed may make matters worse. If you are considering this option, then ask an animal behaviorist which dog they think would be the best candidate for desexing."
