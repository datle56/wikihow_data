      "content": "Take care of your face as Serena does. Serena's skin is flawless. Of course, everyone's skin has bad days and nobody's skin can be blemish free, but there are ways of making sure you prevent the build up of acne. Cleanse and tone your face daily both morning and night to prevent the build up of grease and oil in your pores. If you have acne, don't wash your face more than twice a day, if you do, your skin is likely to be inflamed and make the problem worse. [ citation needed ] To fix blemishes, use a colorless foundation and dab it on noticeable zits, don't cover up the face, let it breathe. The less coverage means the quicker your face will get rid of the acne."

      "content": "Care for your skin as Serena does. Serena's skin is described in the Gossip Girl books as perfect, smooth and fair. Her cheeks are often flushed and rosy. Her complexion is flawless, and often tanned after exotic holidays in the Caribbean or on a private island. For the less fortunate (which is most of us), here are some steps on how to obtain that look: Moisturise your skin daily to keep it soft and hydrated. Make sure your legs, underarms and bikini line are always well groomed (for example waxed or shaved). Serena looks tanned and healthy all year long. To achieve this apply a gradual build-up tan. Do your research on the safety of tanning and tanning lotions before you use them. You may change your mind and you should make an informed decision, not simply follow the beauty herd. Serena would never do tanning beds. Don't overdo the spray tanning or self tanner. An orange bod is so not... hot. Make sure you always smell fresh by wearing fragranced deodorants and applying light amounts of perfume or body spray. Visit your dermatologist for a healthy set of products to get your skin in perfect condition. If you have minor acne, just get a gentle cleanser and maybe an over-the-counter cream."

      "title": "Wear makeup.",
      "content": "Wear makeup. Serena does not wear lots of makeup. Less is always more and it's best not to wear a lot of facial products on your face as it can result in the buildup of acne. Eyes: Serena has huge, navy blue eyes, with thick lashes that never require any form of makeup. Some of us aren't that fortunate. If you have small eyes, don't make it worse by lining the eyes with eyeliner on the top and bottom, that just makes the closeness appear worse. To make the eyes look bigger, line the inside corner of the eye with white eyeliner, it widens up the look of the eye. If your eyes are large, don't do that, the majority of the time it just looks weird. For mascara, don't load it on, coarse lashes are clumpy and ugly. Try using a little brush on the bottom, an a large brush on the top. Two swipes on top, and one on the bottom. Don't overload on eyeliner, it looks trashy and Serena isn't. Just line the top of the eye with a thin line to define it. If you like eyeshadow, use a pretty coir that complements the skin tone. Mouth: Serena has perfectly shaped lips. Her lips are not too thin, but not too plump. If you have thin lips, try using lipliner. Make the line discreet though, and make sure it matches the lip color. Or, get a lip plumping lipgloss. Try Sephora for one. Serena usually just dabs some cherry chapstick on her lips, so make your color natural and opt for chapstick or petroleum jelly, or a clear gloss. Also Serena has a perfect smile that models spend years trying to achieve. If your teeth are far from perfect visit your orthodontist if you can, or use a straightening system such as lumineers. A beautiful smile is worth the money. Serena's teeth are white. So brush, brush, brush! Or use whitening strips, but don't over-bleach the teeth so that the color looks unnatural. No one wants a horse mouth!"

      "title": "Care for your body.",
      "content": "Care for your body. Serena's body is free of flab as she is toned, taut, tall, and lean. Serena has the surreal gift of not exercising, eating what she wants, and never gaining an unwanted ounce. Hardly any of us have that, so exercise, and eat right. Yeah, you've heard that a million times, but it works. Not keen on running or lifting weights? Do pilates, it will kill the flab on your limbs and keep your body lean and your skin tight. Or try yoga, if you're feeling stressed, it practically will have the same effect. Don't go to unhealthy steps to be skinny though, that's wrong, you should love your body for what it is."

      "title": "Care well for your hair.",
      "content": "Care well for your hair. Serena has gorgeous, pale long, blonde hair, often said to be flaxen. To achieve this, use a shampoo that fits your hair type, and that smells good. For example, if you have oily hair, don't use a moisturizing shampoo. You don't have to dye your hair, but if you do, and if you have the time and money, go to a professional. If you can't do that though, just get a natural blonde color from a trusted dye company. Try going to a beauty outlet, one that has a billion colors to choose from. Don't bleach it though, Serena's isn't bleached. Serena's hair is straight, but not stick straight. Just straighten the strands of the hair that are curly. Make it look natural like you just woke up with it like that. If your hair is sensitive to heat, don't fry it by using a straightener, try a straightening shampoo. If you're a brunette and you don't want to dye, try getting honey highlights, but don't make it streaky."

      "content": "Add volume. Whatever your hair add some mousse to it. Then tousle it dry or use a diffuser, straighten any flyaways and just use some hairspray. Serena has messy bedhead hair which is always looking healthy therefore if your hair is dry use a nightly leave in conditioner treatment on your hair to restore its natural state."

      "title": "Get Serena's style.",
      "content": "Get Serena's style. Serena is said to be able to pull off any piece of clothing at any given moment. Not everyone has the luxury of that. Serena wears crazy prints, her brother's Oxford shirts, grungy boarding school clothes, and pretty much anything. She always looks perfect in whatever she is dressed in. She even goes topless on the beach. Serena doesn't have a signature style though, which leaves this part up to you. Fashion is a form of self expression and shouldn't be copied, but created. Be unique and shine! Wear what flatters your body and feels comfortable. After all, wearing a piece of clothing that doesn't feel right is the same as wearing a piece of clothing that doesn't look right. Wear what suits you and express yourself. And all of you gorgeous girls that wear glasses, try looking for contact lenses."

      "content": "Add accessories. Serena likes to wear a lot of chunky necklaces, delicate bracelets and classic earrings. For example, a pretty silver charm bracelet and pearl earrings, nothing too trashy. For a handbag, choose something like a town and country handbag which is fairly large, as Serena often likes large and colourful handbags. Perhaps attach a silk scarf around your neck or handbag to bring back that old school elegance look."
