Use a measuring cup to portion out 1 cup of unrefined, 100% organic shea butter , then scrape it into a bowl with your fingers or a spoon. Shea butter is a natural butter that is high in vitamin E, has anti-inflammatory properties and natural SPF, and helps with collagen production, making it a great base for homemade lotion.

Measure out 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable glycerin and dump it into the bowl with the shea butter and coconut oil. Then, do the same with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vitamin E oil. Vegetable glycerin helps moisturize and soften skin, while vitamin E oil is an antioxidant that helps protect your skin.

Get the highest quality products you can afford if you plan to sell your lotion. Alternatively, make your own vitamin E oil by combining a non-comedogenic base oil with the contents of vitamin E tablets."

      "content": "Add 2 ounces (60 ml) of extra virgin olive oil to the bowl. Measurements don’t have to be precise, but about 2 ounces (60 ml) is recommended. Olive oil is nice and thick, so it’s great for body lotion. However, if you prefer, substitute olive oil with an equal amount of one of the following oils: [4] X Research source Jojoba oil Avocado oil Sweet almond oil [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend for 1-2 minutes.",
      "content": "Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend for 1-2 minutes. Pulse the blender on high speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Body lotion is thick, so stop the blender occasionally and scrape down the sides to ensure the ingredients distribute evenly. Once they’re thoroughly blended, scrape down the sides a final time. [6] X Research source Check the consistency by dipping a finger into the lotion and massaging it into your hand. If there are still lumps, blend the mixture for another 1-2 minutes. Be sure to thoroughly clean and disinfect your blender first! If you plan to make lotion regularly, consider buying a dedicated blender for this instead of using your everyday kitchen blender."

      "title": "Blend in 1 teaspoon (3 ml) of essential oil for scent, if desired.",
      "content": "Blend in 1 teaspoon (3 ml) of essential oil for scent, if desired. While the lotion is still in the blender, add a single essential oil or blend several oils together to give the mixture a subtle fragrance. Blend the lotion for 1-2 minutes to incorporate the oil, then test it on your hand. If you want a stronger scent, add another teaspoon and blend the mixture again. However, avoid using more than a total of 2 teaspoons (6 ml) of essential oil. Use lavender oil for a relaxing, slightly herbal scent. Try rose oil for a classic floral fragrance. Add citrus oils , like sweet orange or grapefruit , for a bright, energetic scent. Use patchouli or cedarwood oil for a deep, woody scent. Try myrrh , frankincense , or benzoin for a dramatic resinous scent. Barcal recommends pomegranate seed oil for anti-aging. Essential oil is very concentrated and can irritate the skin if it isn’t properly diluted."

      "content": "Use skin-safe mica, oxides, and powdered pigments to add color. Instructions will vary by brand, but you’ll typically dissolve the pigment in oil and blend it into the lotion mixture with the other ingredients. Keep in mind that adding color only affects the way your lotion looks, so using it is completely optional. These products are oil-soluble, so they're perfect for this recipe. Shop at specialty stores and always check the packaging to make sure products are skin-safe. [7] X Research source Some skin-safe mica formulas can even add a little sparkle to your lotion! Check product instructions for how much pigment to use with the amount of lotion you made."

      "content": "Add plant extracts to give your lotion additional health benefits. The general usage rate is 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of extract for every 1 pound (453 grams) of product, so it’s difficult to use them unless you’re making big batches. Check individual instructions for different products for more information about how to add them to your lotion. Buy extracts at specialty soap-making and beauty stores. There are many extracts out there and the properties are different for all of them. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, chamomile extract has anti-inflammatory properties and can soothe irritated skin. Green tea extract and aloe extract are skin soothing extracts. Evening primrose and buckthorn extracts are often used for their anti-aging properties. Oat extract soothes irritated skin and is a great option if you have sensitive skin. Mallow extract has intense moisturizing properties. Barcal recommends “chamomile and calendula, which can really help with dry skin and promote anti-aging.”"

[9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Simply stir the zinc oxide into the lotion after it’s been blended. To calculate how much zinc oxide you need to add to achieve SPF 20, multiply the total amount of lotion you have by 0.20. Zinc oxide is usually weighed in grams, so it may help to convert the lotion’s measurements to grams. [10] X Research source For example, if you have 4 ounces (113 g) of lotion, you would use .8 ounces (22.6 g) of zinc oxide. Use a digital kitchen scale to measure out the zinc oxide for the most precise results. If you don't have a kitchen scale, measuring cups and spoons will work fine."

      "title": "Store the lotion in a 20 oz (600 ml) container with a lid for up to 18 months.",
      "content": "Store the lotion in a 20 oz (600 ml) container with a lid for up to 18 months. You should be able to pour the lotion straight from the blender into the container, but if the lotion is super rich, use a spoon to help transfer the mixture. It’s best to store it in an air-tight container, like a glass lotion bottle , especially if you don’t plan on using it right away. Keep it in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight and use it within 18 months. [11] X Research source Since this lotion is oil-based rather than water-based, you don’t have to worry about mold and bacteria growing during storage. However, oil is prone to oxidation and degradation over time. If you’re making lotion to sell, definitely use an air-tight container. If you’re making it for yourself, feel free to screw a pump dispenser onto the mouth of the container instead. Glass and plastic containers both work well. Ritzman recommends using a beauty spatula to remove the lotion from its original container, explaining how “this specialized tool ensures clean and hygienic scooping, [which prevents] contamination and waste. Insert the spatula into the lotion [bowl], glide it along the sides, and easily collect the desired amount.” Ritzman also suggests using a funnel to prevent spillage: “A small funnel can be incredibly helpful when transferring lotion into a new bottle. It will smoothly guide the lotion into the new container without spills or mess.”"

      "content": "Melt emulsifying wax and jojoba oil over a double-boiler. Because water and oil don’t mix, water-based oils need an emulsifier to combine them. Measure out 2 tsp (16 g) of emulsifying wax and ⅔ cup (157 ml) of jojoba oil and pour them into a glass bowl. Place the bowl over a double-boiler and heat until the wax is fully melted. Then, remove the bowl from heat. If you want, use beeswax in place of an emulsifying wax. Just know that your lotion likely won’t remain as stable for as long. Don’t microwave the mixture to melt the wax, as this will break down the nutrients in the oil."

Since the lotion is going on your skin, the water should be distilled, as tap water and filtered water have a lot of chemicals and debris. As the wax and oil heat, start heating the water as well. Once both are heated, carefully pour the water into the oil and mix with a small whisk or milk frother for 30-60 seconds. The color should be off-white and opaque. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix in an amount of cosmetic preservative equivalent to 0.5-1% of the lotion’s total weight. After letting your lotion mixture rest for 30 minutes, add your cosmetic preservative to preserve the mixture and prevent it from spoiling as quickly. Read the package instructions on your chosen preservative to determine how much to add, although it’s usually between 0.5%-1% of the lotion’s total weight. It is possible to make a natural lotion without preservatives, but it won’t last as long as lotions that contain them."

      "content": "Stir in 4 tsp (4 g) of vegetable glycerin. Add 4 tsp (4 g) of vegetable glycerin to the mixture. The addition of glycerin will help to moisturize and soften the skin, adding that extra bit of moisture to make your skin feel glowy and hydrated! Optionally, you can add 2 tbsp (6 mL) of vitamin E oil for additional moisture. Vitamin E oil is especially good to include if you have dry skin."

      "title": "Add up to 2 tbsp (6 ml) of essential oils for fragrance.",
      "content": "Add up to 2 tbsp (6 ml) of essential oils for fragrance. Optionally, you can swirl a few drops of essential oils into your lotion—but don’t exceed 2 tbsp (6 ml) total. These oils only add scent to your lotion, so don’t add them if you prefer an unscented lotion. If you do want a scent, mix in a few drops at a time until you’re happy with the strength of the fragrance. Barcal suggests using rosemary or tea tree essential oils for anti-inflammatory properties, cedarwood oil to reduce irritation, and ylang ylang oil as an effective cleaner."

      "title": "Pour the lotion into a bottle or jar and cool for an hour.",
      "content": "Pour the lotion into a bottle or jar and cool for an hour. For best results, use a glass container with an air-tight lid. Pour or spoon the mixture into your container, cover it, and let the lotion cool for at least an hour before you use it. For plastic containers, the lotion will likely need to cool for a longer period of time before use. The best bottles to use are those made of dark glass. This protects the lotion from UV light, which damages the oils and breaks down the chemical structures. If you have trouble pouring the lotion into a new container, Ritzman advises “warming it slightly” to make it easier to pour. If it’s too thick, she says to place the lotion “in a ziplock bag, snip a corner, and use it as a makeshift piping bag.”"

      "content": "Store the lotion in the refrigerator and use within 3-6 months. Anything made with water is capable of growing mold and bacteria, which is why you want to add a preservative to your lotion. If the lotion was mixed properly, it should last for up to 6 months when stored in an air-tight container. If you notice any mold or bacteria growth, dispose of the lotion immediately. If you choose not to use a preservative, the lotion may last up to 2 weeks when stored in the refrigerator."

If you have sensitive skin, are vegan, or prefer to use skin care products with all-natural ingredients, it’s important to know exactly what goes into your lotion. Store-bought lotions may have chemicals or ingredients that harm your skin, so the best way to avoid negative reactions is to make your own. This way, you approve of every ingredient that goes into the product. For example, if you’re allergic to a certain oil that many store-bought lotions contain, use an alternative in your own mixture. Seek out vegan-friendly or locally-sourced ingredients, if that’s something important to you. Develop your own signature scent by using your favorite essential oils. No more hunting for the perfect scent in stores!"

      "title": "What’s the difference between body lotion and body butter?",
      "content": "What’s the difference between body lotion and body butter? Body lotions are typically a more liquid product with a higher water content—which allows them to spread over your entire body. Body butters, on the other hand, have creamier and more spreadable texture. They tend to be more solid with a lower water content and a higher amount of butters and oils as ingredients. If you want a more lightweight and fast-drying option, stick to body lotions. But if you prefer a richer and thicker feel (and don’t mind an oily residue), then try body butter!"
