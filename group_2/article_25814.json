Make it clear that it’s in their best interest to send you to the nurse, because you might throw up in class if you don’t go. [7] X Research source There’s no need to be especially graphic. Don’t say, “I’m going to hurl all over my books if I don’t leave now.” Say, “I was sick in the bathroom just now, and I’m afraid that I’ll be sick again soon.”"

      "content": "Write a note. If you are under 18, this method will require that you fake a note from your parents or guardians saying you have to go to the doctor. If you’re not comfortable forging a note and a signature, consider a different method. [10] X Research source Be sure that the note includes the date begins with the phrase “Please excuse ___(your name)___...” says exactly when you need to leave explains specifically where you are going (to the orthodontist, the optometrist, etc.) says you’re not coming back that day has your parent or guardian’s signature at the bottom is free of spelling and grammatical errors (so that it’s clear an adult wrote it) is a tiny bit crumpled as if it’s been in your backpack Note that this method doesn’t really work unless you can drive yourself home. If you have to have someone come pick you up, the jig will be up! Depending on your school, the consequences for turning in a forged note may be pretty severe. Some schools will give you detention, suspend you, or, in extreme cases, even expel you. Think hard about whether it’s worth the risk! Depending on why you need to leave school early, it’s possible that your parents or guardians might write the note for you, so consider asking them before you go to the trouble of faking the note."

If it’s a parent or guardian, all they’ll need to do is write a note and be prepared to answer the phone if anyone calls. If it’s an older sibling or friend, they may have to be prepared to lie for you. [15] X Research source Anyone helping you with the plan can also make your story more believable by arriving at school to pick you up at the scheduled time. If possible, tell them what they have to gain by helping you. If it’s your older sister, and you’re skipping school to help her pick out a wedding dress, remind her how excited she’ll be to have you there. If it’s your dad, and you’re skipping school because of a bad breakup, remind him that he never liked your girlfriend anyway, and tell him how much happier and healthier you’ll feel after a “personal day.”"

Particularly if you’re faking sick, the key is to tell them exactly what you need -- to go home as soon as possible. [16] X Research source Don’t confuse assertiveness with aggression. Be clear about what you need, but don’t be hostile or angry. When talking to your teacher, you might want to say something like, “I’m feeling really bad and think I may need to leave. Can I please go to the nurse to talk to her about that?” When you see the nurse, remember to make your case with specific symptoms. For example, “I’m feeling nauseous and have vomited once already. I’ve also had a headache and chills all day. Could I please go home?”"

If there’s an obvious reason why you might want to skip school that day, and your teacher, the nurse, or an administrator knows that, you’ll want to get ahead of the game by mentioning that yourself. [17] X Research source If you’re talking to your teacher, try saying something like, “I feel awful about missing my group presentation this afternoon. As soon as I’m feeling better and back in school, could we please talk about the best way to make that up?” If you’re trying to convince the nurse to let you go home, try saying, “I know what my teacher’s make-up test policy is, so I’m planning to come in and take it during study hall on Friday, assuming I’m feeling better by then.”"

If your parent or guardian did write the note, just be sure they’re prepared to keep the lie going for you when they answer the phone. [18] X Research source If you faked the note yourself, some possible solutions include: Give a number you know no one will answer. If your parents are at work, you could give them your home number. Be prepared to delete the message before they can hear it. Have an accomplice ready to answer the phone at whatever number you give them. An older sibling or friend who isn’t in school is a good option."
