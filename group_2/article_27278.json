      "content": "Clean the jar with soap and water. It would be a good idea to do this, even if the jar looks clean. Any dust or dirt that's on the jar will prevent the paint from sticking. Be sure to scrub off any labels and glue residue."

      "content": "Wipe the jar down with rubbing alcohol. Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe down the jar. Be sure to get both the inside and the outside. This will get rid of any residue and oils that the soap missed."

      "title": "Choose your paint.",
      "content": "Choose your paint. You can use any color of glow-in-the-dark paint, but colors such as yellow and orange might look more like stars than purple and green. Glow-in-the-dark paint usually comes in two different forms: liquid paint and puff paint. Liquid glow-in-the-dark paint is just like any acrylic paint and needs to be put in with a paintbrush. Puff paint comes in a bottle with a pointy tip. You can draw with it straight from the bottle. You can find puff paint in the t-shirt and fabric paint section of an arts and crafts store. It may also be labeled as \"3D paint\" or \"dimensional paint.\" It has a slightly raised surface when it dries."

Do not pour out too much paint at one time. Most acrylic paints dry quickly. If you pour out too much paint, it may dry up before you finish using it. If you are using puff paint, you don't need to do this, because you can apply the paint straight from the bottle."

      "content": "Dip the paintbrush into the paint, and make small dots on the jar. You can paint inside the jar or outside the jar. Painting on the outside will be easier, but the paint will be more likely to get scratched off. Painting on the inside will be harder, but the paint will last longer. If you are using puff paint, simply take the cap off, and start making little dots all over the jar."

Read the label for more specific drying times. Once the paint is dry, you can put the lid back on. This is not necessary, since there is nothing inside the jar that can fall out. The sunlight will also activate the glowing particles in the paint."
