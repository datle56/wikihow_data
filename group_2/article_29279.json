Position the top of the knife blade approximately ⅛” from the centerline—the sharp side will face away from the centerline. Use a pencil to trace the sharp side of the knife. Begin at the centerline approximately ⅛” down from the tip of the blade. Following the blade's curve, draw a line up and around the sharp side of the knife. Continue the line ⅔ of the way up the handle. Do not trace directly along the handle. Since the handle is thicker than the blade, extra material is required in order to enclose it. [5] X Research source Measure and draw the welt. The welt is an additional piece of leather placed inside of the sheath. It runs along the sharp side of the blade to prevent the knife from cutting through the sheath. Create a second curved line that is 9/16” to ⅝” away from the first curved line. [6] X Research source Design a sleek top line to connect the pattern's curved outer-line to its straight centerline. Locate and mark a point on the centerline that is approximately 1 inch above the top of the curved outer-line. Connect this point with the top of the second curved line—this connecting line should gradually rises from the lower horizontal line up towards the top horizontal line. [7] X Research source Create the belt loop. Shift the centerline to the left ¼ inch and extend it up from the top of the handle 4 ½ inches. Connect the original centerline to the shifted centerline with a slight curve. Draw a ¾ inch straight horizontal line from the shifted centerline to the left.
