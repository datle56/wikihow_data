      "content": "Call an exterminator for best results. You’re probably trying to get rid of these yellow jackets on your own, but in some cases that may not be possible. If you don’t know where the nest is, if you’re allergic to yellow jackets, or if you’ve tried several strategies and still have a problem with yellow jackets in your walls, it’s best to contact an exterminator. These professionals have experience dealing with pests and can eliminate the problem for you."

      "content": "Treat the nest at night early in the summer, if possible. It’s best to treat a yellow jacket nest before the colony grows to an unmanageable size. The colony will grow over the warmer months, so it’s best to handle the problem as early as possible. Treating the nest at night ensures that most, if not all, of the yellow jackets are inside. The yellow jackets will die off in the winter, so if the nest is in an unused space (like an attic), you could simply wait for their life cycle to end."

      "content": "Find the entrance to the nest and the nest itself. In some cases, the entrance the yellow jackets use can be up to 30 feet (9.1 m) away from the nest itself. Generally, the entrance to the nest is outdoors. Inspect the structure for holes and try to determine where the yellow jackets are coming from. [4] X Research source If you aren’t sure where the nest is, look for a shiny area of the wall. The yellow jackets can actually use the drywall for nest material, leaving only a layer of paint between their nest and your living space. [5] X Research source You may also be able to hear the yellow jackets moving inside the walls. Find the area where the noise is the loudest, either by placing your ear against the wall or using a listening device."
