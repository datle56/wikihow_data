      "content": "Hinge is available for free, but the paid versions offer extra features. The free version allows you to make a profile , upload photos, and view profiles of people in your area. You can filter by gender, age, location, ethnicity, and religion. The free version lets you “like” up to 8 profiles per day, and if someone’s like you back, it’s a “match.” From there, you send each other unlimited messages and even do video calls. Hinge is available for free on iPhone and Android. There are also two paid versions, Hinge+ and HingeX, that offer extra features such as unlimited likes. We'll outline them in detail below. Hinge+ costs $29.99 for 1 month, $59.99 for 3 months, and $89.99 for 6 months. HingeX costs $49.99 for 1 month, $99.99 for 3 months, and $149.99 for 6 months."

      "content": "The free version of Hinge lets you send 8 likes per day. As you use the app, profiles will appear on your screen according to your filter settings. You can select “like” or “pass” on each one. Free users can see who liked their profile by going to the “Likes You” tab at the bottom of the screen. You can see one like at a time and select “like” or “pass” on each. After 8 likes, free users get a notice saying they’re out of likes for the day. Your likes reset every day at 4:00 AM."

      "title": "You can filter by gender, age, ethnicity, religion, and location.",
      "content": "You can filter by gender, age, ethnicity, religion, and location. You can even make certain traits “dealbreakers,” which means that your matches must have them. For instance, you can provide a specific age range—say, 25-33—then check the box for “dealbreaker” so that only profiles of users aged 25-33 appear on your feed. If you uncheck “dealbreaker,” users outside of this range may occasionally appear. Use the “dealbreaker” option for traits that are especially important to you . Any filter can be set to “dealbreaker,” including height, ethnicity, distance, etc. If you don’t set a filter to “dealbreaker,” you may still see users who don’t match that filter. For gender, you can filter by 50 different options, including traditional “male” and “female” labels and many genderqueer and tans-inclusive labels. The gender(s) for your desired partner in the “I’m Interested In” preference is automatically set to “dealbreaker.” That way, you will only see users who match your gender preference."

      "content": "You can send unlimited messages and do video calls. Once you match with someone, you can talk to each other on the app as much as you like. [1] X Research source You can also do video calls to get to know each other a bit before meeting face-to-face . This also lets you confirm that the person matches their photos, which is great for safety. Video calling becomes available once both of you have messaged each other ."

      "content": "You can send unlimited likes every day. This can be super helpful if you often run out of likes when using the free version. But more importantly, liking more profiles increases the chance of getting a match. Both Hinge+ and HingeX can send unlimited likes—in fact, most special features are available for both memberships, but we'll explain the one key difference below. You’re still limited by the number of users in your area. So for instance, if you live in a small town with only 20 nearby Hinge users, you might run out of profiles to “like.”"

You can then browse the profiles and select “Like” or “Pass” on each one. You can only see likes you received from someone else. When you like another user’s profile, your like is sent to that user’s feed and you won’t see that user again unless they like you back."

In addition to the filters in the free version, Hinge+ and HingeX users can also filter by political beliefs, drinking habits, marijuana use, tobacco use, drug use, educational level, and even whether someone wants to have children someday (or already has children of their own). These filters help weed out people you’re not compatible with. [2] X Research source The more filters you use, the fewer profiles you’ll see—but those profiles should be more compatible with you."

Instead of having to pay for boosts, your HingeX profile is boosted 24/7, making it visible to everyone in your area who matches your filters. When you like someone, that like appears at the top of their “Likes You” list (if they’re a free user) or the top of “All” (if they’re subscribed to Hinge+ or HingeX). Being more visible doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get more matches, but it definitely improves your chances ."

You can also buy a “Superboost,” which lasts for 24 hours. [3] X Research source Boosts work for the free version of Hinge and for Hinge+. HingeX profiles are automatically boosted. 1 boost costs $9.99, so they aren’t cheap—though you can purchase 3 for $26.97 ($8.99 per boost) and 5 for $39.95 ($7.99 per boost) A “Superboost” cost $19.99. Only boost your profile during the daytime or evening, when users are browsing the app. Boosting at 3:00 AM won’t get you more views if all your potential matches are asleep."

Paying for Hinge+ or HingeX isn’t worth it if few people will see your profile anyway. If you only see a few dozen nearby profiles when browsing Hinge, you’re better off sticking with the free version.

Hinge+ and HingeX may have fantastic features, but they’re not worth the money if you don’t use the app. 8 likes per day is plenty if you only browse Hinge for a few minutes every now and then. And besides, you can still get matches if you stick with it long enough. [8] X Research source If you find yourself using the app more often, try subscribing to Hinge+ or HingeX for a month."

Likewise, you can screen for drug use, sobriety, and other options not available in the free version. Set these to “dealbreakers” to ensure you only see what you’re looking for. [10] X Research source Using advanced filters could also reduce the amount of time you spend on the app since you won’t need to search profiles for specific dealbreakers."
