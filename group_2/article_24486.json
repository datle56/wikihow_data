      "content": "Yes, kissing someone else is usually considered cheating. If a person shares a romantic kiss with someone who’s not their romantic partner, especially if the kiss includes other physical touches or makes one or both people sexually aroused, that’s usually considered cheating. It can be both physical and emotional cheating, as well as a violation of trust, especially if the person doesn’t mention it to their partner. [1] X Research source However, it all depends on the boundaries the couple has set within their romantic relationship. [2] X Research source A friendly, non-romantic kiss may not be counted as cheating. In some cultures, a kiss is as regular as a greeting. So for some people, the answer here is no. If you and your partner have discussed cheating and decided that it’s only reserved for explicit moments where someone does something romantic, then friendly kisses probably won’t be an issue."

In many relationships, flirty comments on Instagram photos of hot people and suggestive DMs to people they may never meet in person are considered cheating.

Whether it’s flooding an ex’s feed with likes and comments or constantly DM’ing OnlyFans models, flirting with others on social media is usually cheating.

Depending on the boundaries you have in your relationship, your partner kissing another person can feel like the end of the world. To determine where the relationship will go from here, sit down and have an honest, heartfelt conversation about how it made you feel. Make sure to ask about their reasons behind the kiss, too. Then, discuss your boundaries and see if your partner will abide by them. If they don’t, then you may want to break things off. [11] X Research source For example, you can approach your partner and say, “When you kissed that person in the hall, it made me really upset. Can we talk about where to go from here?” If your partner doesn’t know that you know about the kiss, ask if you two can talk. When you’re both calm, initiate the conversation by saying, “I know you kissed someone else, and it was really upsetting. Can we talk about where things go from here?” When you initiate the conversation, try not to put any of your feelings onto them by saying things like “You made me feel this way.” Instead, use “I” statements and express your feelings without putting any blame on them. For example, “I felt betrayed.” Avoid making rash decisions to get revenge or hurt your partner. While it may feel like the best option at the time, it can cause further issues in your relationship."

When your partner reveals that they kissed someone once and immediately regretted it, it’s normal for you to be upset and to want time to process things. Once you process things, you may find yourself feeling like it’s something you can work through. In that case, the relationship is salvageable, it just depends on whether you’re willing to forgive them and set boundaries in the relationship. [12] X Research source If your partner is genuinely sorry and wishes to work things out with you, you may want to hear them out and discuss the situation if you also want to save the relationship."

Now, a friendly kiss goodbye to friends probably won’t implode the relationship, but if your partner kisses other people romantically and betrays your trust, it may be time to end things. If they’re willing to betray your trust and kiss other people when you’re not around, it’s often an indicator that they’re willing to go beyond that, too. You may be able to keep things together if both of you can sit down and have an honest conversation about why things are rocky. But you must both be willing to work through these hard times and commit to each other. It’s okay if the relationship has run its course. Not all relationships last forever, and even if you’re hurting right now, you’ll likely come out stronger on the other side."

      "content": "Sit down and talk about what you do and don’t accept. Bilek says to have a conversation about boundaries when you’re both calm and not stressed, tired, or hungry. Once you’ve made sure both parties are calm and in the right headspace, then have a conversation about your dos and don’ts in a relationship. Say something like “I want to talk about some of my boundaries, and also want to be respectful of what you’re comfortable with. Can we have a conversation about our boundaries in a relationship?” According to Tovar, setting boundaries means being very clear about what kinds of behavior you will and won’t accept. Bilek says boundaries look different for everyone, as everyone has different needs and things they’re comfortable with. One couple may view watching porn as crossing a boundary, while another may be okay with that. Discuss what you consider to be cheating or crossing a boundary, such as sending suggestive DMs to people who aren’t your partner, flirting with other people, using dating apps, sending sexts or nudes, and kissing or other physical contact."
