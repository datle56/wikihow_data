      "content": "Start with small talk. If you don't have many, or any friends, making small talk is the first part and can be the first step in developing a friendship. Small talk subjects often include the weather, hobbies, or what you do for a living, but another strategy is to talk about something around you. You might try a simple introduction by way of icebreaker (\"Hi. I'm Julie.\"). [1] X Research source Ask them about their hobbies to see if you can do something together within one another's shared interests. Get to know this person. Find their likes and dislikes, favorite activities, their favorite colors, etc. There is so much you can find out! Friends are everywhere, so don't be shy and stay inside your house! Go to the park, or even join a club or an after school activity! Make friends everywhere and anywhere!"

If you don't question them anything , some people might feel awkward, having to lead the conversation alone. If they don't seem to be interested, think to yourself to find another best friend- there are a lot of people just like you out there! [2] X Research source [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Look beyond the \"popular kid\" in the class or school. That is a given and looks like you're trying too hard. Instead, hang out with a new kid or someone you've seen around, but don't know yet. Try a shy person holding back - they may appreciate someone else making the effort for a change!

      "content": "Start hanging out with this friend. Be careful not to get too excited by talking too much or they might think youâ€™re strange. If you are at school, you can ask to hang out at the break. If you're a teenager, you could sit next to them and start a conversation.

      "content": "Nurture the new friendship. [6] X Research source Get their phone number and call them once in a while, maybe once or twice a week. Like plants, don't water them too often. Don't call on the same day every week; try to pick a random day or keep it unpredictable. Give them gifts if their birthday or a holiday is coming. It doesn't have to be something big or expensive. Homemade gifts are a good option. But don't make it look like you spent hours on it. Write a handwritten letter. Sure, It's easier to write emails or write on their Facebook wall. But, there is a certain charm to the handwritten letter or a card. Just how you took some time to find a suitable paper, write on it, and mail it instead of the online alternative, shows how much thought went into it. They may keep it for years to come! Ask if one day they can come over to your house, or do something fun together. Make sure you've known this person for a while first, though. If you know someone for a day or two, then ask them kindly and convincingly to come to your house, they may find this a bit strange. Some friendships come easily and nurturing them is not hard to do. Others, however, require more thought and action. That's okay. Putting effort into a friendship doesn't mean the friend is not right for you, it simply means that your friendship is different and you need to work to keep it strong. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure it goes both ways. Friendship is two-sided. Follow your friend's cues for whether they're also interested in a close friendship with you. If you pursue a one-sided friendship, [8] X Research source you'll likely be disappointed with the result, and may seem needy or desperate to the other person."

If it doesn't work out with your original friend, you will still be better off than before; with even more friends to try with."

If the person tells the secret, you will not have lost much because you did not mind this secret getting out. You will have learned that they cannot be trusted as your best friend. If the person keeps the secret, you can tell another, slightly larger secret. Soon your friend may build a track record of trust by keeping all of your secrets, and you will know that this is a person that you can share your deepest thoughts with. [9] X Research source"
