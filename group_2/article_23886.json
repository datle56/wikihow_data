      "content": "Pluck the lens from its case and stick it on a lens plunger. Use the pads of the fingertips—not the nails—of your index finger, middle finger, and thumb to grasp the lens around its edge and pull it from the case. Then, if you have a pair of color-coded lens plungers, press the suction cup of the “insertion” plunger onto the outside of the lens. Don't center the plunger on the lens, though—stick it right near the outside edge.

It's a bit more challenging but still very manageable to insert the lens with just your fingers. [3] X Research source If you have two scleral lenses, it's important that you put the correct lens in the correct eye each time. The easiest way to keep track is to always insert and remove the same lens first—for example, always do the right-eye lens first. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill the lens with saline solution after checking it for damage. Take a close look all around the lens for chips, cracks, scratches, or stuck-on debris. If you find any of these, don't insert the lens—call your eye doctor instead. Otherwise, hold the lens underside-up so that you can fill it completely with saline solution. [5] X Trustworthy Source Michigan Medicine The University of Michigan's medical center, which provides patient care, supports research, and educates the public on health topics Go to source Your eye doctor will likely recommend that you use a specific type of saline solution with your scleral lenses. Don't use saline intended for typical contact lenses unless advised to do so. Try to keep the lens completely filled with saline until it touches your eye. If you spill more than a tiny amount, refill it."

Bend your upper body and neck so that your face is parallel to the table (if you're sitting) or countertop (if you're standing). While keeping your head in this position, try to look down at your chin so that your eyeballs are at your lower eyelids. [6] X Research source Place a towel on the table or countertop. That way, if the lens falls, it won't break. You need to put in scleral lenses by “feel,” not by looking. However, you may want to lay a small mirror on the table or counter for the first few times you try this. Doing so may help you keep your head in the proper parallel position.

Don't worry about this. Scleral lenses are much larger than typical contacts, so you really need to peel back your eyelids to get them out of the way.

Allow your eyelids to relax slightly, so that they overlap the edges of the scleral lens—this, along with suction to your eyeball, will hold the lens in place.

If the lens feels and looks like it's centered, and if you can see clearly and don't see any air bubbles beneath the lens, the lens is in the right place. Move on to the other lens if you have two of them. If the lens isn't centered or doesn't feel right in your eye, follow the instructions for removing a lens, then repeat the insertion procedure from the start (including washing your hands).

Press your index finger (and the top eyelid it's holding open) towards your nose, then press in against your eyeball, downward, and slightly outward toward your temple. This will cause your upper eyelid to slide underneath the top edge of the lens, causing its suction hold to break. [15] X Research source The lens will fall out of your eye once the suction hold is broken. Either have your free hand ready to catch it, or place a thick towel on the countertop below you. This maneuver may take some practice to get right. If you have a removal plunger available, use it instead. Alternatively, you can perform the same maneuver with your lower eyelid, if that's easier for you."
