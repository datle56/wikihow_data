This will help you figure out the safest way to consume more alcohol. Have one drink and then wait 15 to 45 minutes to see how the alcohol affects you. [1] X Research source Then, consider having another one if you don’t feel any effects (you don’t feel a “buzz” or aren’t drunk). If you do not normally consume alcohol, or have 1 or 2 drinks once a week, your tolerance will likely be comparatively low. If you consume 2 drinks 5 days a week, your tolerance will likely be higher. Always drink in a safe environment with responsible drinkers. Do not put yourself in a situation where impairment is inherently dangerous or drink with people who are irresponsible and are likely to push you past your comfort zone."

Just make sure to do this without harming yourself, or anyone else. It is important to realize that alcohol consumption is never risk-free and that while you may not feel the effects of alcohol consumption, you may nevertheless be too impaired to function normally. [2] X Research source Go slowly . For example, consume only one additional drink than you normally would. If you never drink, start with one alcoholic beverage, or only drink half of it. If you usually have one glass of wine or one spirit (mixed drink), have 1 ½ or 2 drinks. This will ensure that you do not consume too much alcohol as you increase your tolerance. Have a glass of water in between each drink to help yourself consume drinks slowly, stay hydrated, and prevent a hangover . [3] X Research source Eat while drinking . Consuming food before you drink and while you’re drinking helps keep the alcohol from having quite as strong of an effect. Drinking on an empty stomach helps alcohol enter your bloodstream quicker, causing you to get drunk faster. [4] X Research source"

Generally, the more someone weighs, the more quickly their body can absorb alcohol. This dilutes the effects of alcohol, making their tolerance level higher. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Additionally, muscle tissue absorbs alcohol faster than fat, which helps lessen the effects of alcohol. [14] X Research source Muscle tissue is denser than fat, so you often gain weight when you build muscle and lose fat.

If you want to gain weight , remember to do so safely. Adding even 10 pounds (4.5 kg) to your weight can help increase your alcohol tolerance.

      "content": "Aim to drink in the same places or environments. There’s evidence that repeatedly drinking in the same settings, like a specific bar or friend’s house, builds an environmental tolerance to alcohol. Because your body gets used to drinking at a specific spot, it expects the effects of alcohol and absorbs it more quickly, which reduces how quickly you feel buzzed or drunk. [17] X Research source On the other hand, drinking in new settings can have the opposite effect. For instance, if you get drinks at a new bar or attend a day party when you usually drink at night, you might notice the effects of the alcohol more quickly. [18] X Research source"

[19] X Research source Make sure to keep track of how much you’ve consumed to help you figure out how much alcohol is in your system, too. [20] X Research source In general, you reach your peak buzz (when you feel most relaxed, social, happy) when you’re between a 0.02 and 0.06 blood alcohol concentration. Once you’re past this concentration, you don’t get any more positive benefits, but you do experience more negative effects (more impaired, fatigue, slurring speech, hangover).

      "title": "Have a meal before you drink and snack while drinking.",
      "content": "Have a meal before you drink and snack while drinking. Alcohol absorbs less quickly when you have food in your stomach, making the effects of alcohol less noticeable . On the flip side, having nothing in your stomach causes you to feel the effects of alcohol more quickly. So, aim to eat a hearty meal before you start drinking and plan to snack in between drinks. [25] X Research source The size of the meal you have matters. For example, if you consume a larger meal, it will slow the absorption of alcohol into your blood, making your tolerance temporarily increase. What you eat influences your tolerance, too. Meals rich in carbs, fat, and protein help you absorb alcohol more quickly, increasing your tolerance. So, aim to eat a hearty meal like a hamburger, salmon, tofu stir fry, or egg and cheese sandwich. The amount of time between food and alcohol consumption also affects your tolerance. For example, if you consume a large meal either just before or during alcohol consumption, your tolerance will be greater. If you have a smaller meal and wait to drink, your tolerance will be correspondingly lower. Remember that food only delays the absorption of alcohol into your system. You won’t necessarily be able to consume much more alcohol than you usually do, so it’s best to err on the side of caution and not go overboard."

Consuming alcoholic beverages when you’re dehydrated leads to decreased tolerance because there is less water in your blood to dilute the alcohol, says nephrologist Dr. Arvind Madan. So, make sure you drink plenty of water to help reduce the effects of alcohol. [26] X Research source Before you consume an alcoholic beverage, Dr. Madan recommends having a glass of water to help ensure you are hydrated. Have a glass of water in between each drink. This helps you stay hydrated and reduces your risk of developing a hangover, as well as ensuring you do not consume more than the sensible guidelines suggest.

If you’re out with friends who like to drink a lot and have a higher tolerance, don’t try to match their drinks one-to-one. Stick to the pace you’re comfortable with to help ensure you don’t overdrink. [29] X Research source There’s no shame in nursing the same drink for a few hours or ordering a water when your friends grab another drink. It’s better to go at your own pace and enjoy the drinking experience rather than drinking more than you’re used to (and dealing with the negative effects). Order a mocktail (non-alcoholic cocktail), non-alcoholic beer, or soda instead of water if you’re done consuming alcohol. Clinical psychologist Dr. Tala Johartchi says this is a great way to feel comfortable while socializing with friends who are still drinking."

There’s no set amount of time that it takes to develop an alcohol tolerance, though in general, it’s a slow process.

Body composition : People who have more muscle mass typically have a higher tolerance than people who have a higher body fat percentage. Sex : Women are usually smaller than men, have a higher percentage of body fat, and produce fewer enzymes that break down alcohol. So, women typically have a lower tolerance than men. Age : Alcohol tolerance usually decreases as you age, so older adults typically have a lower tolerance than younger adults. Ethnicity : Some ethnicities have a lower tolerance compared to others. For instance, people with Asian and Native American ancestry often have a lower tolerance. Certain medications : Some medications and prescriptions can affect tolerance or even have dangerous interactions with alcohol. If you take any medications, ask your doctor if it’s safe to drink before you consume alcohol.

Additionally, people handle different types of alcohol differently. [38] X Research source The average beer contains 5% alcohol, the average glass of wine contains 12% alcohol, and the average shot of liquor (vodka, tequila) contains 40% alcohol. [39] X Research source In general, the smaller the typical serving size, the stronger the drink. A shot of whiskey can have as much alcohol as an entire light beer. In many countries, the alcohol content (ABV) is labeled on the container. The higher the content, the higher the effect. Sweet fruity drinks and/or cocktails can be very difficult to judge on alcoholic content—especially as a novice. Since these can vary widely based on the bartender, there is no one standard. Not all types of drinks are standardized. A typical lager-style beer is usually about 5% alcohol, but some craft beers are 20% or more. Different drinks may produce different effects. Be aware that while inebriation has common effects, different types of drinks may cause slightly different effects. For example, a person may be much more mellow when drinking wine than after having tequila."
