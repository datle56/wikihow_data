Licensed cosmetologist Mark LoBiondo notes how to keep your beard clean while growing it out. “Use shampoo and hair conditioner on your beard as you would your head hair. Do not shampoo too frequently (once per week).” As your beard grows, you may develop what is called “beard itch.” Treat any itchiness by applying beard oil throughout your growing beard. It’ll bring moisture to your beard follicles and keep any itch at bay. Professional barber Juan Sabino suggests making beard oil yourself using olive or coconut oil as a base. He also recommends putting some brown sugar in the oil. “And you can use that as a pre-face wash to soften up the hair and also get rid of some of the dead skin.”"
