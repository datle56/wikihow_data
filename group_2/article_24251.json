      "content": "Measure the distance from the wall to the toilet floor bolts. It's a good idea to check the size of your toilet before you remove it, so you know the new one will fit. Place the end of a measuring tape against the wall behind the toilet and extend it until it reaches the center of the toilet's floor bolts. This distance is called the “rough-in.” [1] X Research source Toilets commonly come in three sizes, based on their rough-in: 10 in (25 cm), 12 in (30 cm), and 14 in (36 cm). Toilets with a 12 in (30 cm) rough-in are the most common. Take your measurements to the hardware store to look for a toilet that will fit your space."

      "content": "Turn off the water at the supply valve. According to Jones, \"This is usually accomplished by turning a valve to the right. If it's an older-style gate valve, it will require several turns before it closes. If it's a quarter-turn valve, you only have to turn the valve one-quarter of a 360-degree turn.\" [2] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 13 December 2021. Turning off the supply valve cuts the water to the toilet, so you can replace it with less mess."

Then, flush the toilet a few times until you've removed as much water from the tank as possible.

Then, he says to get out a large sponge and press it into the tank, so it absorbs the remaining water. Squeeze it out into a bowl and repeat the process for the toilet bowl.

[6] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 13 December 2021. Sometimes, nuts and washers can become so rusty that you can simply remove them by hand.

      "content": "Lift the toilet up and away from the floor. Although you may be able to lift the entire toilet by yourself, it can help to have another person lift one side of the toilet. According to Jones, the safest way to remove the toilet is to lift with your legs and keep your back straight. [7] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 13 December 2021. Once you pull the toilet up from the floor, remove it from your bathroom. If you're setting the toilet down in your home instead of outside or in a garage, place it on an old towel or tarp until you can throw it away. If you're working by yourself and want to make the toilet lighter before you remove it, unscrew the bolts from the inside of the tank. Then, lift the tank away so you're only pulling up the toilet base."

To insert the new bolts, put the bolt head facing down into the large opening on the flange. Then, slide the bolt to the narrow end of the slot and repeat this for the opposite side.

      "content": "Fit a new wax ring around the flange. Most new toilets come with a wax ring, but it's always a good idea to check. Open the new wax ring and center it on the flange. If your wax ring has a sloped edge, place it upside down so the narrow end of the wax ring touches the flange. [11] X Research source Wax rings can last 20 to 30 years if they’re well-maintained. If your toilet starts leaking near the base, you'll know it's time to replace the wax ring."

It can help to have another person lifting the toilet or guiding it onto the bolts. Once you've pressed the toilet to the wax ring, don't remove the toilet again or you'll break the seal."

Then, use a wrench to finish tightening the bolts, but go back and forth between the two bolts. Stop tightening as soon as the nut is snug. This way, you're applying even pressure on the toilet so it stays level and the bowl doesn't crack. [13] X Research source The toilet bolts will stick way up even after you've installed the washers and nuts. This is completely fine, since you'll saw them down."

      "content": "Cut the excess length from the bolts and pop on decorative caps. According to Jones, it’s normal for the new bolts to be too long. He says, “Use a hacksaw to cut off away the excess length of the bolts—leave about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of bolt above the nut. Then, push the decorative caps over each bolt, so they're no longer visible.” [14] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 13 December 2021. Brush away the metal filings with a clean cloth or suck them up with a vacuum. Many new toilets will come with the seat already installed.

Run the caulk all the way around the base of the toilet, so there's no gap between the toilet and the floor. Then, drag your fingertip through the caulk to smooth the line and remove excess product. [19] X Research source Most caulking products require about a day to cure, so avoid mopping the floor around the toilet. Use 100% silicone caulk or one designed for kitchen and bath for a faster cure time and mildewcide properties."

      "title": "Call a plumber if you’re unsure about the process.",
      "content": "Call a plumber if you’re unsure about the process. Installing a toilet is fairly easy, but it does require lifting the toilet into place and lining it up just right with the bolts. This step is best done with two people—one to lift the toilet and the other to help guide the base onto the bolts. If you don’t have anyone who can help you lift the toilet, have a professional come in and install it for you. You should also call a plumber if you’ve tried to install the toilet but it’s leaking, or if you think there’s an issue with the plumbing under the toilet."
