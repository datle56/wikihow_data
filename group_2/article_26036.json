      "title": "Grab a long pole.",
      "content": "Grab a long pole. Traditionally, people played limbo with a broom, but any long rod will work. For quick solutions, try using a wrapping paper roll, curtain rod, pool noodle, or a smooth stick from outside. Ropes, cables, and similar items can also work as long as you have people to hold them tight. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have two people hold the pole parallel to the ground.",
      "content": "Have two people hold the pole parallel to the ground. At the beginning of the game, hold the rod high enough so that the tallest player can get under it easily. Professional limbo kits include stands to hold the pole, but you can also just have two people hold it by the ends. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Line up players behind the pole.",
      "content": "Line up players behind the pole. Have all participating players stand in a straight line behind the limbo pole. Keep the line at least 3 feet (0.91 m) away from the rod itself, that way the current player has room to manoeuvre. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a song to play (optional).",
      "content": "Find a song to play (optional). Due to its roots as a Trinidadian dance, most people listen to music while playing limbo. The most popular song choice is “Limbo Rock” by Chubby Checker, but any island-themed music is appropriate. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have players bend backwards and go under the stick without touching it.",
      "content": "Have players bend backwards and go under the stick without touching it. The goal of limbo is to successfully pass underneath the stick without letting it touch any part of your body. Players cannot crouch, duck, or crawl to pass under, meaning they have to bend backwards to get beneath the pole. [6] X Research source For older groups looking for a challenge, try adding additional rules like “Your hands cannot touch the ground” or “Your hands must stay behind your back.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower the stick and start a new round.",
      "content": "Lower the stick and start a new round. After everyone has had a turn, lower the stick by 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) or however much seems appropriate for your group. Then, have everyone pass under again. As the game continues, it will get harder and harder to pass underneath the pole. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Disqualify a player if they fall over or touch the stick.",
      "content": "Disqualify a player if they fall over or touch the stick. In traditional limbo rules, a player is out if they touch the pole in any way or can’t keep their balance. If you’re playing limbo casually or with children, keep the fun going by making the rules less strict, like letting players touch the pole with some parts of their body or giving people multiple chances before disqualification. [8] X Research source To keep players happy after they’re out, ask them to cheer on or heckle other players."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep playing until only one person remains.",
      "content": "Keep playing until only one person remains. Continue lowering the stick and having players pass under it until all but one person have been disqualified. This person is the limbo champion. If the final pole height is too low for all the remaining players, try: [9] X Research source Declaring the game a draw between the final players. Moving the pole to its previous height and having players pass under it until someone messes up."

    {
      "title": "Use a water hose as a pole on hot days.",
      "content": "Use a water hose as a pole on hot days. Hook your hose up to a water faucet and turn it on. Hold your thumb over the hose opening to create a stream of water. As with normal limbo, have players pass under the water, disqualifying players that get wet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a flashlight as a pole so you can play in the dark.",
      "content": "Use a flashlight as a pole so you can play in the dark. Turn on your flashlight and hold it horizontally, creating a beam of light. Have everyone pass under the beam, disqualifying players that touch the light. This can be done in a clear, outdoor location at night or in a room with the lights turned off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear hats or pillows for a fun challenge.",
      "content": "Wear hats or pillows for a fun challenge. To make the game a bit more difficult and zany, have players wear big, tall hats or stuff their shirts with pillows. The added bulk will make it harder to move and the added girth will make it harder to avoid the pole."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play the game backwards to shake things up.",
      "content": "Play the game backwards to shake things up. Traditionally, players pass underneath the limbo stick feet first, allowing them to easily see the pole. To add some variety to the game, try going head first instead."
