      "content": "Observe your dryer's efficiency. The best way to tell if the appliance might be on its last legs is to simply see whether it's doing its job properly. Start paying close attention to how your appliance is working. If your clothes are coming out damp, for instance, it might mean that they just need a little more drying time, or it could indicate a problem with the dryer's heating elements. Look for recurring issues that point to a specific flaw in the unit itself. Failure to start, erratic drum rotation or a tendency to shut off mid-cycle are all common (and potentially serious) dryer issues. [1] X Research source"

Inspect all the dryer's main components (including the drum, lint trap, dials or display and wall outlet) to see if another factor might be the cause.

Sticking to the same color scheme and general construction will also keep mismatched units from being so obvious. [17] X Research source It's important to choose appliances with similar capacities—the dryer should be able to hold the washing machine's maximum load size. If you have the space, consider buying a washer/dryer combo. That way, your appliances will match, and you can be sure that they'll both stay in good working order for years to come.
