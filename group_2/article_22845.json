      "content": "Evaluate your relationship with her. It’s important to consider whether telling her your feelings is appropriate based on the strength of your relationship. Imagine you tell her. Is your relationship strong enough to handle it if she doesn’t feel the same way, or if she does but decides to stay with her current boyfriend? If yes, it might be worth the risk. If no, weigh your options carefully. If you haven’t known this girl very long, this probably isn’t a good option. She could see your professed feelings as very abrupt or forward. Make a pro/con list to weigh the risks and benefits of telling her your feelings. Also consider the risks and benefits of not telling her. Is it worth the risk? [1] X Research source"

Not only could this admission change your relationship with this girl, but it could affect your relationship with her boyfriend or other mutual friends, if you have them. Fear signals that the outcome is important to you. Once you’ve decided you want to go ahead with expressing yourself, use your fear to motivate you, rather than deter you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Tell her. Once you’ve built up your courage, go for it. When you're alone with her, say something along the lines of: \"Caitlin, I know that you're dating Sam, and I don't want to mess anything up for you, but I've started to have feelings for you. I want you to know.\" If you think she reciprocates the feelings, you can add, \"I've sensed that the attraction might be mutual, and I want to clear the air.\" If she has been giving you vibes that she's interested, it's important that she knows so that she doesn't keep giving you mixed signals."

      "content": "Respect her response. You’ve weighed the risks and benefits of your decision, and you knew that she might not respond favorably. It is important, especially if you want to remain friends, to accept and respect her response. She may tell you that she does not feel the same way. Rejection is painful, but it is one of the ways that we reduce our ego and grow. [3] X Research source She may tell you that she does have feelings for you, but that she wants to stay with her boyfriend because they have a strong relationship and she also has feelings for him. This is harder to accept, because it feels like there is a glimmer of hope, but once she tells you her decision to stay with her boyfriend, you need to move on. Don’t torture yourself. Waiting around and hoping that she’ll change your mind will only be a waste of your time. If you accept her response, you will be better able to move forward and search for a romantic connection elsewhere."

If you want a shot with her, you need to see her regularly Join her friend group. Ingratiate yourself to her best friends. If her friends hold you in high regard, chances are she will, too. Being part of her friend group ensures that you will be invited to events that she will be attending. Get her phone number. Wait for a natural opportunity to ask for her number. You were having a conversation and it was cut off? Ask for her number so you can continue talking. You’re planning a get-together for your friend group?

Casually ask her about her relationship. As she grows to trust you, she’ll share more information with you. If she tells you that her boyfriend never takes the time to hear about her day, don’t tell her that you’d always make time to listen to her if you were in his shoes. Store this information. Another day, make sure you ask her how her day is going and actively listen. If you are hanging out with her friends while she’s not around, pay attention if they are gossiping.

If she tells you she’s attracted to you, too, give her some time to decide if she wants to act on that. Don’t pressure her. That will make her withdraw from your friendship and undo the work that you’ve done to show yourself off. If you physically hook up with her, recognize that there will be consequences. In all likeliness, she’ll feel guilty, and might even be angry with you for disrespecting her relationship status. You will seriously damage any relationship you have with her boyfriend, and likely with mutual friends. If you make this move and she tells her boyfriend, you will probably be cut out of her life unless they decide to break up."
