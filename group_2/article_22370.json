She asks viewers to “Guess the millennial.” The Millennial is the person who completes the gesture with their thumb and pointer finger. Taylor Swift famously does Millennial heart hands. Fans also refer to it as “Fearless Heart Hands” because Swift frequently did the gesture while singing “Fearless” during the Eras tour. [5] X Research source"
