      "title": "Splash your face with water.",
      "content": "Splash your face with water. Since water is the base of most cleansers, splashing it on your face can help clean your skin without other products. However, be aware that using water only may not clean all of the excess dirt, debris, or oil off of your face. Use lukewarm or warm water to splash your face. Hot water may not only strip your skin of important oils, but may also burn it. Rub a washcloth soaked in warm water over your face. This can cleanse your skin while gently exfoliating dead skin and removing dirt and debris. Don't scrub too hard because you might damage your skin."
