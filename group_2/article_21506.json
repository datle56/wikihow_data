      "content": "Make a hole with the knitting needle. Place the tip of the large knitting needle in your selected spot and hammer it all the way into the ground. Pull the knitting needle out of the ground. This makes a nice, neat hole for your rose cutting or stem to be placed."

      "title": "Place the cutting into the hole.",
      "content": "Place the cutting into the hole. Immediately place the cutting into the hole you prepared with the knitting needle. If you are propagating from a rose stem, push the stem all the way into the hole until the bottom of the flower head touches the ground. If you are propagating a cutting with leaves, push the stem down far enough that at least five of the leaves are not in the ground. It will look like a tiny plant."

      "title": "House the cutting.",
      "content": "House the cutting. Place the jar over the cutting and water. In approximately nine months, the cutting will have taken root and will be a new baby rose bush for your garden."

      "title": "Keep a summer cutting well watered.",
      "content": "Keep a summer cutting well watered. If you are propagating during the summer, itâ€™s important to water the cutting regularly, as you would a normal rose bush. However, if you are propagating in the fall, simply leave it alone until spring and remove the jar when you see new growth and there is no more threat of frost. For outdoor plants, water them every other day, because they usually dry too fast. If the leaves are becoming yellow, it's a sign that you're over watering them."
