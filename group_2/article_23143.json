      "content": "Do keep your profile positive. According to dating and relationship coach Suzanna Mathews, you should highlight all the “awesome and amazing characteristics that you bring to the table,” such as your playfulness or sense of humor. Negativity can turn a lot of people off, and you don’t want to lose a potential match because of a poorly-worded answer. If you present yourself in a positive manner, you’re more likely to attract the right partner! Remember, you want to draw attention to your unique and interesting traits. If you've had negative dating experiences in the past, it's normal to be jaded or keep your guard up, but try to avoid letting that affect the tone of your profile."

      "content": "Do be honest about your intentions. It’s important to “be very clear about why you’re on [dating apps],” says relationship coach Maya Diamond. Make sure your answers reflect what you’re looking for so you don’t waste your time and energy, plus “filter the people who are not right for you.” Being upfront will narrow down your matches to give you the most compatible results, whether you’re seeking a long-term commitment or a casual fling.

      "content": "Do include a mix of funny and serious answers. There are endless prompts on Hinge, but it’s a good idea to take on three categories: one that showcases your humor, one that showcases your knowledge, and one that showcases your dream date scenario. [3] X Research source That way, your matches can get a good view of your personality and know what you’re looking for. Dating coach Imad Jbara says that “humor is the key to success” when it comes to flirting, so don’t be afraid to throw out jokes and be playful. As a rule of thumb, keep your answers short and sweet so there’s room for discussion in your chat (and when you go on your date). Some great prompts to help you get a response include: “ The way to win me over is ,” “ Together we could ,” and “I won’t shut up about.”"

      "content": "Don’t choose common or cliché answers. Your Hinge prompt answer is the perfect place to show off your personality, so get creative and come up with a unique response. If you pick a basic answer that everyone else has heard before, people are less likely to like your profile. So, think about your hobbies, interests, and favorite activities to craft a response that’s entirely your own. According to matchmaker and dating coach Lauren Sanders, “profiles that are very detailed stand out from the rest.” For example, a common answer that guys use for the “I go crazy” prompt is “MILFs.” That answer doesn’t provide any insight into your personality or give your matches anything to work with."

While Hinge prompts are supposed to be fun and playful, some people answer them in a way that makes them seem materialistic or shallow. Avoid answering questions in a way that showcases unrealistic standards for a partner, such as listing how tall they should be or how much money they should make. Instead, answer the prompt so it highlights your personality, values, or relationship goals."
