[1] X Research source If you can't find any crackers, you can use biscuits or light-colored cookies (ie: vanilla wafers, sugar cookies, graham crackers, etc.). Don't use chocolate chip cookies or Oreos—those are way too dark!"

      "title": "Add some water, if needed.",
      "content": "Add some water, if needed. If you spat the crackers into a toilet, you don't need anymore water. If you spat them into a bowl, bag, or sink, then add in a little water. This makes the vomit look more real. [3] X Research source You can also try some white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, apple juice , or even a little milk."

    {
      "title": "Add something mushy and smelly.",
      "content": "Add something mushy and smelly. Wet cat food or wet dog food work great for this. You can also use a little bit of canned tuna or baby food. It will help make the vomit look (and smell!) more real. [4] X Research source You could also chew up some cereal, spit it out, then mix it with vinegar."

[9] X Research source If the cereal has large flakes, you can crumble them with your hands first. If you don't have Raisin Bran or Cornflakes, you can use another type of brownish, flaky cereal. Granola is a great one!"

      "title": "Add something chunky.",
      "content": "Add something chunky. A handful of dry cat or dog food will look gross. If this is human vomit, you could try a handful of dry oatmeal or granola. Put most of the chunks in the middle of the glue puddle, and a few bits on the edges. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Peel the vomit off. The glue will dry semi-flexible, but be careful not to bend it too much. Leave the vomit some place for your victim to find, like the floor or their pillow. Because this vomit is made from glue, it should last a very long time. [19] X Research source"
