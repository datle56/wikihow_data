      "content": "Exercise your core. Your core muscles include the muscles in your lower back, as well as your abdominal muscles. It is extremely important as a track athlete that you have very strong core muscles, as these play a huge role in running mechanics. One great way to strengthen your core muscles is to do a plank. To do a plank, begin by laying flat on your stomach on the floor. Then, lift yourself off the floor by planting your bent elbows on the ground directly under your shoulders, and lifting so that your toes are holding you up. Keep your back straight, and your abs engaged. This will work both your abs and your back. Hold the plank for 30 to 60 seconds, and repeat one to two more times."

      "content": "Work your glutes with single-leg deadlifts. This exercise is designed to target your glutes, the key muscles in your buttocks. Strong glutes play a vital role in running and overall fitness, helping you achieve better performance and shape. If they aren’t strong enough your body may try to rely solely on your hamstrings (the muscle in the back of your thigh), which will slow you down and reduce your endurance. Hold a dumbbell, a weighted plate, or a kettlebell in your right hand. Keep the opposite (in this case, left) leg planted firmly on the floor. Begin to hinge forward, bending at the waist. Keep your left leg planted on the floor, and allow your right leg to lift straight into the air behind you. You should feel the muscles in the back of your left leg, and your left glute begin to contract in order to support you. Be sure to keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles engaged in order to avoid injury. Stop at the point you feel your muscles contract. When you feel the hamstring and glute muscle in your left leg engage, stop there and hold for a few seconds. Return slowly and carefully back to standing. Then repeat the exercise eight to 12 times, and then do it again using the other leg."

Although you don’t want to overdo it, you do want to train enough so that your aerobic fitness will be tip top by the time the season starts. Mix up your running, doing different things each day of your training in order to keep it interesting. For example, do sprinting one day and a longer distance run the next day."

      "content": "Run longer distances. Whether you are a long distance runner or a sprinter, you should do some long distance running to improve your endurance. Long distance runs are important for improving cardiovascular fitness, and are also important for teaching your body to run efficiently. If you are a distance runner, this will be your main mode of training, but if you are a sprinter, you should still try to do at least one day of distance running each week. For example, run five miles one day, and then run 3 miles the next. You will want to vary your distance so that you can focus on speed during the shorter distances, and then focus on endurance during the longer runs."

Sprinting is important for teaching your muscles how to store and expend energy quickly and efficiently. [7] X Research source If you are a long distance runner, then you can probably limit your sprinting days to one or two days each week, but don’t skip it! Sprinting will help you increase your speed, even over long distances. One good example of a sprint workout is to sprint 400 meters as fast as you can, give yourself a one to two minute break, then sprint 300 meters, repeat your break, then sprint 200 meters, take another break (limit this one to a minute), and then sprint 100 meters. Repeat this circuit once more."

      "content": "Run stairs. This is a great way to improve your aerobic fitness, and it will also help to build the muscles in your legs. A really good place to do this running is at your local football stadium, as these usually have several rows of stairs. Start with running (not sprinting) as quickly as you comfortably can up and down one row of stairs, then keep running to the next row of stairs. Continue this for 10 – 15 minutes, then repeat the set one or two more times. Do this with caution though! As you get tired you may not lift your legs as high, making it more likely that you will trip on the stair. Alternatively, if you don’t have access to stadium stairs, you can also find a steep hill and run up that as fast as you can. Then walk carefully back down. Repeat this for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure to wear sunscreen if you are doing this on a sunny day."

      "content": "Practice dynamic stretching . Before you begin any workout, especially if it is an aerobic exercise, you should consider doing some dynamic stretching or dynamic warm-ups. Dynamic stretches should get your body moving and warmed up, putting the muscles you will be using through their full range of motion. [8] X Research source Start with some simple moves, such as high knees, heel kick backs, then straight leg lifts forward, back, and out to the side. Try doing leg circles in both directions. Big arm moves are very effective for increasing blood flow. Arm raises in front, out to the sides, triceps press backs, overhead reaches, shoulder circles, rowing motions, can all accompany leg moves and improve the warm up. Stretch your spine . [9] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019. You can do this by rounding your back as you bend down to try and touch your toes.

[10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Any stretching done before you run must be a dynamic stretch. Static stretches, in which you elongate your muscle and hold it for several seconds, should not be done as part of a warm-up. Doing so can reduce your performance.

If you are outside, and it is cold, put on some warm, dry sweatpants and a sweatshirt while you are stretching to keep yourself and your muscles warm."
