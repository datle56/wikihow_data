      "content": "Give them a great name. Many people also believe that someone's name can affect their personality.

      "content": "Identify your character's beginning. Once you know where they end up, decide where you want them to start out. This should follow logically from where they end. For example, if you want a character that learns to appreciate others, you want to show them not appreciating the people that care about them in the beginning. You probably also want to show why they think they don't need people. The backstory can make the character deeper, but it is not always necessary. You can only hint at it instead of elaborating in detail."

If you want to hint at a character's past, think of things that they might wear or keep that are significant to them. For example, in The Legend of Korra , Mako wears his father's scarf at all times.
