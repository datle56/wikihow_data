For a vegan substitute, try agar agar powder, which you can buy online or from a health food store. You can substitute agar agar for gelatin in the same amounts, so there’s no need to adjust your measurements for this recipe. [1] X Research source"

Flavored gelatin comes in many flavors and colors, so you can make a whole rainbow of gummy bears. For example, you could get strawberry, orange, lime, and blue raspberry."

The gummy bears are now ready to eat. [2] X Research source If you don't have a mold, you can make gummy drops on some parchment paper instead. You can leave the gummies in the freezer longer, if you like. Frozen gummy bears are chewier and taste juicier than refrigerated or room-temperature gummies.

      "content": "Pre-measure your ingredients to make classic “Gold Bears. ” To get perfect, store-bought texture and taste in your gummies, you'll need a few harder-to-find ingredients as well as high-end gelatin (known as 250 bloom). Measure your ingredients by weight instead of by volume for more accurate results. Weigh them out in advance and have them on hand to be quickly mixed in—timing in candy making is key. To make this classic gummy bear recipe, you’ll need: 70 grams (2.5 oz) of gelatin, 250 bloom 140 millilitres (0.59 c) of water 225 grams (7.9 oz) of sugar 22.5 grams (0.79 oz) of sorbitol powder 245 grams (8.6 oz) of glucose syrup, or 179 millilitres (0.76 c) 15 grams (0.53 oz) of tartaric or citric acid 12 grams (0.42 oz) of food grade essential oil, any flavor"

Mix the 70 ounces (2,000 g) of gelatin and 140 millilitres (0.59 c) of water in a Ziplock bag and let it rest in the water bath for 30 minutes.

For a more unusual flavor, try a flavoring oil or extract, such as vanilla extract, orange rind oil, or cherry extract.

Honey also makes a healthier alternative to the corn syrup used in many store-bought gummies. To do this, mix the following ingredients in the saucepan, turn on the heat, then add 3 tablespoons (28 g) of gelatin.

If you don’t eat dairy, even almond, soy, rice, coconut, or oat milk works well and imparts a distinct, creamy texture and feel to the common gummy. To make creamy gummies, whisk half the milk in with the gelatin. Then heat it up like normal, whisking in the other half right at the end before it comes off the heat. [11] X Research source Adding a touch of vanilla or almond extract, or even some cinnamon, to the mixture can take it to new heights. This substitute works with basic gummies as well as the pureed fruit versions."
