      "title": "Choose an opaque, plain-looking box.",
      "content": "Choose an opaque, plain-looking box. Something made from plastic, metal, or cardboard will keep people from seeing what's inside. Its ordinary appearance will blend in with the background and lower the chances of people looking through it. Avoid boxes made from clear or frosted plastic. They may look pretty, but people will be able to see what's inside."

      "title": "Be discreet about your box.",
      "content": "Be discreet about your box. You can decorate it if you really want to, but the more boring it looks, the less likely people will want to go through there. Don't write things like \"Keep Out,\" \"Top Secret,\" \"Girl Supplies,\" on it, however. It will make people realize that you are hiding something, and they will be more likely to look through it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the box out of sight.",
      "content": "Keep the box out of sight. Place it in an inconspicuous spot, such as the back of a cupboard, under your bed, or in a drawer. Be sure that the location is easily accessible for you. Make sure that no one sees you taking out your supplies or hiding them. It may be wise to switch your hiding spots once in a while."

      "title": "Choose higher shelves, especially if you have younger siblings.",
      "content": "Choose higher shelves, especially if you have younger siblings. Whether you share a room, closet, or cabinet with a younger sibling, you may want to store your period supplies on the highest shelf that you can still reach. If the supplies are out of their eyesight, they won't know that they are there, and won't go snooping around."

      "content": "Establish privacy rules with your family. Tell them that you are not comfortable with them prying through your private belongings. If your family members respect you, and they come across your box, they won't go through it."

      "content": "Keep enough pads or tampons to last a day in a separate pencil case. [1] X Research source If someone takes a peek inside your bag, all they will see is a pencil case. They will assume that you have a bunch of pens or pencils in there, and would never guess that you actually keep pads or tampons in there. Choose a flat pencil bag for pads. Choose a narrow pencil box for tampons. You can also use a makeup bag. A glasses or spectacles case is a discreet container for tampons or small liners. How many pads or tampons you bring depends on how heavy your flow is. Some people will need to change theirs out more often."

    {
      "title": "Don't keep entire packs of pads in your locker.",
      "content": "Don't keep entire packs of pads in your locker. Pads come in large, bulky packs that are hard to disguise. They also take up a lot of valuable locker space. Instead, keep enough pads to last a day or two in your locker. Bring more pads with you when you run out. Store these pads in a pencil case or a makeup bag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep some pads or tampons in your backpack.",
      "content": "Keep some pads or tampons in your backpack. Choose a side pocket, or better yet, an inside pocket. Stick enough pads or tampons to last you a day or two. This way, when you have to use the restroom to change out a pad or tampon, you can take your bag with you. People will assume that you are simply protective of your belongings."

      "content": "Consider having other period-related supplies handy. Pads and tampons are the must-haves for any person's period, however, there are a few extra items that can make the period more bearable. Here's a list of items you might want to consider having in your locker or bag: Pain medication (note that not all jobs and schools allow this) Spare underwear in case of unexpected periods or leaks An extra sweatshirt, to tie fashionably around your waist, in the case of leaks. Feminine wipes, to clean yourself up in between changes Emergency chocolate"

      "title": "Keep spare underwear and feminine wipes in a makeup bag, pencil bag, or pencil case.",
      "content": "Keep spare underwear and feminine wipes in a makeup bag, pencil bag, or pencil case. Try to keep these (especially the feminine wipes) with the rest of your tampons or pads. This way, you will have everything together, and won't have to take as much with you when you go to the restroom. Feminine wipes are like baby wipes, but they contain no harsh chemicals and are specifically designed for sensitive regions."

      "title": "Hide a pad or tampon in your coat pocket.",
      "content": "Hide a pad or tampon in your coat pocket. Make sure that the pocket is big enough; you should not see the pad or tampon sticking out of it. This way, if you have to use the restroom, all you have to do is put on your coat. If your pocket has a zipper, zip it shut so that the pad or tampon doesn't accidentally peek out."

      "content": "Hide a pad up your sleeve. [2] X Research source If you have to go to the restroom, but can't take your backpack with you, keep a thin pad up your sleeve. Keep in mind that this only works with sweatshirts and shirts that have tighter sleeves. It won't work on loose, flowing sleeves."

    {
      "title": "Slip pads or tampons inside your boots.",
      "content": "Slip pads or tampons inside your boots. If you like to wear boots, you can always tuck a pad or tampon inside them. Pads will fit most comfortably in fitted, lace-up boots. Tampons may fit inside bulky, slip-on boots. You may need to tuck the tampon under your sock to keep it from rattling around, however."

      "title": "Hide thin pads in the back pocket of your pants.",
      "content": "Hide thin pads in the back pocket of your pants. Most pads will fit completely inside the pocket, and won't stick out. If they are thin enough, they also won't create any suspicious bulk."

      "content": "Hide tampons inside an old, empty lipstick tube. [3] X Research source Once you use up a tube of lipstick, clean it out well, and use it to hide tampons. When you go to the restroom, bring the lipstick tube with you. People will assume that you are just going to reapply your lipstick. Keep in mind that this only works if you are wearing lipstick that day. You can clean out empty lipstick tubes using soap, water, and lots of q-tips. [4] X Research source"
