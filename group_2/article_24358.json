      "title": "INTPs are logical, while INFJs are emotional.",
      "content": "INTPs are logical, while INFJs are emotional. Despite both personality types being introverted and intuitive, how they communicate could hinder a platonic or romantic relationship. Thinking types are focused on the purpose of detailed information while feeling types judge the values of general content information and derive meaning from that. Simply put, INTPs like to use their heads, whereas INFJs tend to follow their hearts. This could cause disagreements during an argument; however, because of their open minds, these personality types can make up easily. [5] X Research source If you’re an INTP, focus on being open-minded and practicing active listening with an INFJ to help them feel heard. If you’re an INFJ, work on describing your emotions rationally to let an INTP know how you feel. The other difference between feeling vs. thinking is the relationship between perceiving and judging. These two functions are connected to the resulting communication with each other, which can leave each of these individuals feeling deeply disconnected from one another if they're rigidly attached to their own inner perspectives."

If you’re an INTP, refrain from asking an INFJ personal questions too fast. Instead, focus on small talk and work your way up. Ask about their job or what their favorite color is before diving into their family history."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Even with these personality differences, these types are an ideal pair because they help support one another’s weaknesses. If you’re an INFJ, work on being more direct about your feelings. Use “I” statements to express yourself , and understand that conflicts don’t always have to be divisive.

      "content": "INFJs have a hard time adapting to change, while INTPs don’t. Even with their easy going nature, INFJs may struggle in quickly changing environments due to overwhelming emotions. They manage themselves best in structured situations where they can predict their outcome. On the other hand, INTPs are quick thinkers that look at change rationally rather than emotionally. Despite these differences, the 2 types make an excellent pairing because they’re able to fill in the gaps: INTPs help INFJs think logically, while INFJs help INTPs express their emotions. [10] X Research source If you’re an INFJ, take a few deep breaths to ground yourself if you are in the middle of an unforeseen change. Uncomfortable emotions will pass, and you can do this. If you’re an INTP, allow yourself a few moments to ask yourself, “How do I feel about this?” It’s okay if a change makes you uncomfortable—don’t be afraid to address that."

      "content": "All in all, an INTP and an INFJ are a golden pair. These personalities form a yin-yang relationship that brings out the best in each other. Because of this, an INTP and INFJ make for an excellent romantic, business, or platonic relationship. They can support each other’s weaknesses equally while learning something in the process. Keep in mind that you and your partner’s Myers-Briggs personality types aren’t a tell-all for your relationship—every relationship is different, and nobody is perfect! Even if you are a “golden pair,” your opposite personality preferences can still lead to disagreements. Understanding your personality type , however, can help you and your partner, friend, or coworker learn each others’ strengths and weaknesses so you can be a better pairing. [11] X Research source"
