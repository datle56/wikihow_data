      "content": "Get 8 regular size skeins of a soft, medium-weight yarn. You can knit a quick and easy baby blanket by holding 2 strands of yarn together and knitting with 2 strands at once, so you will need 8 regular-sized or 4 double-sized skeins. Any soft, medium-weight yarn in the desired color will work for a baby blanket. You will need approximately 1,600 yards (1,500 m) of yarn, so check the label for details on the amount of yarn in each skein. [1] X Research source You can purchase a special type of yarn in craft supply stores that is meant for knitting baby blankets. The yarn label will usually indicate that it is meant for knitting baby items. This yarn is extra-soft and comes in a variety of colors. Babies can be messy, so be sure to choose a material that is machine-washable. [2] X Expert Source Jen Webber Knitting Specialist Expert Interview. 4 August 2020. Consider the climate where the baby livesâ€”if they live somewhere that's really warm, choose something light, like a cotton yarn. If they live somewhere cold, go with something like a washable wool.

      "content": "Get a pair of US size 11 (8.0 mm) circular knitting needles. [4] X Research source This size works well for knitting a simple baby blanket with 2 strands of medium-weight yarn at a time. Make sure that you get a pair of needles with a long cable in between them. This will help to ensure that there will be plenty of room for your stitches. A size 29 in (74 cm) or longer cable is ideal. Circular knitting needles are best for knitting a blanket because there is plenty of room for the stitches in between the needles. Knitting a baby blanket with straight needles is harder on your wrists because the weight of the yarn pulls down on the ends of straight needles. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a slipknot and place it on your right-hand needle. Hold 1 strand from 2 separate skeins of yarn so that the ends are even, and the strands are together. Loop the 2 working yarn strands around your index and middle finger 2 times and then pull the first loop through the second loop. Pull the tail of the yarn to tighten the knot. Then, slip the loop off of your fingers and onto your right-hand needle. This will count as your first cast on stitch, so make sure to include it in your total number of casts on stitches."

Loop your working yarn around the end of the left-hand needle. Then, insert the right-hand needle into this loop, and yarn over again. Pull this yarn through the loop on the left-hand needle.

Turn the knitting needles so that the working yarn is on the right-hand side of the cast on stitches. Then, insert the right-hand needle into the first cast on stitch, loop the yarn over the end of the needle, and pull it through the old stitch. Let the old stitch slip off the end of the needle as the new stitch replaces it. Repeat to the end of the row.

      "content": "Change colors every 10 rows if you want to create stripes. You can use a single color of yarn for the entire blanket, or switch colors every 10 rows for a chunky striped look. To switch colors, tie the end of 1 skein of yarn to the beginning of a new skein of yarn. Do this every time you want to switch colors. Remember to always use 2 strands held together for the pattern in this article. The end of a row is a good place to switch your yarn, but you may switch colors anywhere you like. Make sure to cut the excess yarn after you switch."

Check the length of the blanket using a tape measure. A good time to check is when the blanket looks like it is getting close to the desired length, or when you are almost out of yarn.

[9] X Research source When the yarn is too short to weave through the edge any more, tie a knot around the last stitch. Then, cut the yarn about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the knot. Keep in mind that weaving in the end if the yarn is optional. You may also cut the yarn 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the last stitch to finish your work."
