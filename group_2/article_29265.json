    {
      "title": "Select the right materials.",
      "content": "Select the right materials. For a basic cuff, you will need several feet of an elastic string, a selection of pony beads, and a pair of scissors. Although pony beads are classic for making a traditional kandi cuff, you can use any type of beads as long as the hole is large enough to fit your string through twice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure and cut your string.",
      "content": "Measure and cut your string. Depending on how large your wrist is and how wide you want your cuff to be, you will have to use varying amounts of string. Wrap the string around your wrist to get a general measurement, and then multiply this length 5-6 times over. Cut the string at this length; if you run out of string during the beading process, you can always cut and tie on a bit more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bead your first row.",
      "content": "Bead your first row. Tie a knot at the end of your string (leaving a small tail), and begin sliding on beads. Using about 25-30 beads is standard, but you'll just want enough so that the cuff will be big enough to slide on and off your wrist without being too loose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie off the first row.",
      "content": "Tie off the first row. Pull the string and beads taut so that they are all lined up tight against the knot at the end of the string. Tie the short knotted end with the long loose end in a secure knot. Cut off the excess string from the short end, but leave the long end of the string intact.."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bead the second row.",
      "content": "Bead the second row. The second row is a bit slower-going than the first, because the process involves adding a single bead and then weaving the string through the previous row. To bead the second row, string one bead on the long end of the string, and then slide the string through the bead directly under and next to the bead you’re working with. Add another bead, and slide the string through the bead next/under it on the first row. Continue this process all the way around, until you reach your starting point.Add one bead to the string, then thread the string over the first bead and through the second bead of the first row. This is how you weave the rows together. Because you’re skipping beads in the first row in order to weave the second row, your cuff will appear zig-zag with only two rows completed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a third row of beads.",
      "content": "Add a third row of beads. Use the same process for adding the second row of beads to add the third row of beads. This time, you don’t need to tie the string off in a knot but can continue the process by adding beads to fill in the spaces. Slide a bead onto the string where there is a gap, and then attach it to the cuff by putting the string through the corresponding bead in the first row. Work your way all the way around the bracelet until you’ve created two full rows of beads, and tie off the string."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add additional rows.",
      "content": "Add additional rows. Although you can technically have a complete cuff with only two rows of beads, many people prefer to add multiple rows in addition to the first two. Use the aforementioned method of weaving on beads to create an uneven row, and then adding another row to fill in the spaces."

      "content": "Finish your bracelet. When you feel that your kandi cuff has been perfected, tie off the string and try it on for size! If at any point in the bracelet-making process you run out of string, you can cut an additional length and tie it to the ends, trimming off any excess to create a smooth transition.

    {
      "title": "Get your materials ready.",
      "content": "Get your materials ready. An X-cuff is aptly named for the series of ‘X’ shapes that appear in the completed cuff. Because of its width, though, it requires a bit more string and beads than a regular cuff. It is also particularly attractive if you use an assortment of colors for your beads. Regardless, grab a spool of elastic string, pony beads of your choice, and a pair of scissors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bead your first row.",
      "content": "Bead your first row. Wrap your string around your wrist to estimate the length for the cuff, and then tie a knot on the end to secure it (leaving a tail). Add on beads in a color pattern of your choice, pulling them taut to the knot on the end. When you’ve beaded an entire row long enough to wrap around your wrist, tie the two ends together and pull the long end of the tail through the bead next to the knot."

    {
      "title": "Bead the second row.",
      "content": "Bead the second row. To bead the second row, you’ll be adding a series of beads to the string and then sliding the string through the first row of beads to weave them together. Slide 3 beads onto the long string, and then pull the string through the adjacent bead in the first row. Add another 3 beads, and tuck the string through the next bead in the first row. Continue this process until you’ve worked all the way around the bracelet, and then pull the string tight to secure it."

      "content": "Add the third row. The third row of beading is the same as the second, except that you will weave the string through the center bead (the middle bead in each set of 3 beads) from the second row. Slide the string through the row of beads in the second row until it comes out of the first ‘center’ bead. Then, add three beads, and tuck the end through the next ‘center’ bead in the second row. Continue this process all the way around until you’ve completed the third row, and pull the string tight."

      "content": "Work your way back to the beginning. With four rows of beads completed, you’ve probably noticed that the cuff is a bit uneven looking - the first row is straight across, but the fourth row is wavy. This is because you’ve only completed one half of the bracelet, and need to go back to the beginning to complete the mirror half on the other side of the bracelet. Carefully weave your string through your bracelet until you reach the starting point of your first row (where the knot is tied). If you run out of string during this step, you can add more and trim the ends short so that the knot doesn’t stand out."

      "content": "Finish your bracelet. When you’ve completed the two halves of the bracelet, you’re ready to tie it off! Knot the end of the string multiple times so that the beads cannot slide off of it. Then, trim the excess off both this string and the other tail end (still somewhere in the center). With that, you’re done! [2] X Research source"
