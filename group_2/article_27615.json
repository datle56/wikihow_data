      "title": "Boil the water.",
      "content": "Boil the water. This can be done in a kettle, over a fire, in a pot on the stove, in the microwave, or any other way you typically boil water. To conserve water, energy, time, and money, only boil as much water as you’re going to use in your tea."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash and tear the mint leaves.",
      "content": "Wash and tear the mint leaves. Rinse them to remove any residual dirt, bugs, or soil that may be on the leaves. Then, tear the leaves to help them release their aromas and give your tea a stronger flavor. There are a variety of mint leaves you can use, including chocolate mint, spearmint, and peppermint.

    {
      "title": "Prepare the leaves.",
      "content": "Prepare the leaves. The mint leaves can go into a tea ball, a teapot designed for loose leaf tea, into a coffee filter, in a French press, or straight into a mug."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the boiling water over the leaves.",
      "content": "Pour the boiling water over the leaves. Some teas should be done at different temperatures, so you don’t burn the leaves, but mint is hardy, and you can pour fully boiling water right over the leaves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Steep the tea.",
      "content": "Steep the tea. Mint tea should steep for five to 10 minutes, [2] X Research source but longer is fine if you want a stronger tea. Once your tea reaches the strength you like (either take a taste or go by the smell), remove the leaves. You can also leave the leaves in, and the tea will continue to get stronger. Use a strainer if desired to remove the loose leaves if you didn’t use a tea ball or special pot. If you’re using a French press, push the plunger down when the tea has reached the desired strength."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add additional ingredients.",
      "content": "Add additional ingredients. Once your tea has steeped, you can add honey or sweetener if you desire, or a splash of lemon before you drink it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your mint tea.",
      "content": "Make your mint tea. Using the ratio for a larger batch, make your hot mint tea. Just place the mint leaves in a large heat-safe bowl and pour the boiling water directly over the top. Allow to steep. To make a single serving, use the same mint–water ratio and method as you would for a mug of hot mint tea."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir in sweetener and lemon.",
      "content": "Stir in sweetener and lemon. Once the tea is ready, squeeze the lemon juice into the tea, making sure you don’t get any seeds in the tea. Add your sweetener of choice, to taste, if you want sweet tea. Stir vigorously to break down the sugar particles. Agave nectar also works well as a liquid sweetener and honey substitute."

    {
      "title": "Let the tea cool to room temperature.",
      "content": "Let the tea cool to room temperature. Once it’s cool, strain the tea into a pitcher and discard the used mint leaves. Refrigerate until it’s cold. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Serve over ice with cucumber.",
      "content": "Serve over ice with cucumber. When the tea has chilled, and you are ready to serve it, fill your glasses with ice. Thinly slice a cucumber and add a few slices to each glass. Pour the tea and enjoy."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the tea leaves.",
      "content": "Rinse the tea leaves. Place the green tea in a teapot and add one cup of boiling water. Swirl the water to rinse the leaves and warm the pot. [4] X Research source Pour out the water, leaving the green tea leaves in the teapot."

      "content": "Add sugar and mint. Steep for an additional four minutes, or to taste, and serve. [5] X Research source You can take mint or herbal tea if you have an upset stomach. Drink a lot of ginger ale or eat ginger which is like a natural remedy. Stay away from acid, like lemonade or soda. You can take over-the-counter medicine like Pepto Bismol. It helps to reduce stomach acid."

      "title": "Freeze your mint leaves in an ice cube tray.",
      "content": "Freeze your mint leaves in an ice cube tray. Leftover mint from the store or garden can be preserved for later use. To freeze your mint, place two washed mint leaves in each basin of an ice cube tray. Fill each with water. Freeze them until you’re ready to use the mint. [6] X Research source Once the mint cubes have frozen, remove them from the tray and place them in a plastic bag in the freezer. (Now you have your ice cube tray back!) When it’s time to use your mint, pull the ice cubes out of the freezer (as many as you need for how much mint you require) and place them in a bowl to thaw. When the ice has thawed, drain the water and pat the mint dry."

    {
      "title": "Dry your mint.",
      "content": "Dry your mint. Dried mint can be used to make teas, and can even be put into the reusable cups for single-serve coffee machines. Take the fresh sprigs of mint and loosely bundle a couple together with elastic bands. Hang them upside down somewhere warm and dry until the leaves are dry and brittle. Mint contains more moisture than some other herbs, which means it can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks to dry, depending on the climate. The warmer and dryer the room you use for drying, the less time the process will take. When the leaves are dry, place them in a bag or between sheets of wax paper and break them up. Store in a spice jar."
