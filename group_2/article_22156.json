      "content": "Expect to have to work on maintaining the relationship. Remember that marriage is a nuts and bolts arrangement. While you're planning your wedding, you may entertain fairy-tale notions of a life lived happily ever after. The reality of marriage is that sometimes, it's just a day to day grind - one or both of you may be tense, on edge, bored, not happy with the other one, not feel so warm and fuzzy. It's not all about your feelings. Repeat: It is not all about your feelings. It's about your commitment to one another. Whether or not you \"feel\" like you're in love, \"feel\" you're getting your needs met, or whatever, the reality is, you have sworn a vow to one another. A lot of the time, marriage isn't romantic at all - it's about teamwork and getting the job done every single day. [1] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Show appreciation and don't ever take him/her for granted or you will miss him/her when they're gone! You are made differently, that's why you were attracted to each other. Most people clash about these differences, but when you realize that your strengths compensate for your spouse's weaknesses, then their strengths will cover your weaknesses too."

Don't do things to get a rise out of your spouse, and if someone at the office is hitting on you and won't stop, tell your boss about it and ask that one of you be transferred.

But it's far better to simply come to a point in the argument where you can stop fighting actively and sleep on it. Instead of continuing an argument that is escalating out of control and going in circles, stopping, resting, and waking refreshed can give you new perspective, and help you come to a better and more satisfying resolution than just fighting it out until you're both battered, bloody, and after you've said things you can never take back. Sleeping on it will also help you allow residual negative feelings to dissipate - you don't always just say, \"Okay, that's it, argument over,\" and return to those warm, loving feelings - sometimes resentment lingers awhile. Let it go - get some rest. You'll both feel better in the morning. [13] X Research source"
