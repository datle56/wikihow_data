      "content": "The longer you wait, the harder it’ll be for her to hear. If she tells you that she has feelings for you or if you notice that she may want to be more than just friends, tell her that you don’t feel the same way. Don’t drag it out or it’ll only be harder for you to say it and for her to accept it. [1] X Research source If you want to stay friends with her, don’t lead her on or wait too long to tell her that you don’t have romantic feelings for her. If you think she might like you as more than just a friend, but you aren’t sure, try asking one of her friends about it."

      "title": "Break the news face-to-face so she has closure.",
      "content": "Break the news face-to-face so she has closure. Telling her in person is the most respectful way you can do it. She’ll be able to see your face and hear your voice, which can show her that you’re being genuine with her and you really don’t want to hurt her feelings. It may help her move on more easily. [2] X Research source If you really can’t meet up with her in person, try setting up a video chat or at least a phone call so she can hear your voice."

      "title": "Tell her straight up that you’re not interested in a relationship.",
      "content": "Tell her straight up that you’re not interested in a relationship. It may not be what she wanted to hear, but it’s important that you clearly communicate your thoughts and feelings. Keep it clear and succinct so there isn’t any confusion. [3] X Research source You could lead with something nice and then deliver the news like, “I think you’re really nice, but I just don’t see us being together.” You could also give a clear and direct no and say something like, “I’m not interested in a relationship right now.”"

    {
      "title": "Avoid putting the blame on her.",
      "content": "Avoid putting the blame on her. She’s already put herself out there by telling you that she likes you, so don’t make it even worse for her by pointing out any faults or issues you have with her. Instead, focus on yourself and your own feelings by using statements that use “I” instead of “you.” [4] X Research source For example, you could say, “I don’t want a relationship” instead of something like, “I’m not interested in you.”"

    {
      "title": "Nobody likes being rejected, so try to be kind about it.",
      "content": "Nobody likes being rejected, so try to be kind about it. Just because you don’t feel the same way about her doesn’t mean you should dismiss her feelings. Be respectful and kind when you let her down, even if she gets emotional or upset. Try not to make it into a big deal and she’ll likely be able to move on and you may even be able to remain friends. [5] X Research source You could try being apologetic so she understands that you don’t enjoy hurting her feelings, but you also didn’t want to lead her on. For instance, you could say something like, “I’m really sorry I just feel the same way, but I hope that we can still be friends.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest about why it’s not working out.",
      "content": "Be honest about why it’s not working out. Don’t give her abstract reasons like “I’m just not ready for commitment” or “You’re too good for me.” Instead, give a real, concrete example of why you don’t think you’re right for each other. She’ll appreciate that you’re being honest and you aren’t just making up an excuse. [6] X Research source For instance, you could say something like, “You’re good friends with my ex and I just don’t feel comfortable with it” or “I don’t think we share common interests.” The truth doesn’t have to be harsh. Instead of saying something like, “I just don’t like you,” you could say, “I just don’t think we’re compatible.”"

      "title": "Try to stay as upbeat as you can it doesn’t feel as awkward.",
      "content": "Try to stay as upbeat as you can it doesn’t feel as awkward. Telling her you don’t have feelings for her is uncomfortable for both you and her. Stay calm and positive so she doesn’t feel any worse than she already does. Keep an upbeat attitude to help console her and make the moment feel less awkward. [7] X Research source For example, after you tell her that you don’t have romantic feelings for her, you could say something like, “I really treasure the friendship we have and I feel like a romantic relationship could ruin that.” If she’s really upset and wants you to leave her alone, don’t try to crack a joke or be funny."

      "content": "You can remain friends if she’s okay with it. If she takes the news relatively well (meaning she’s not furious or inconsolable), try telling her that you hope you can still talk to each other and hang out. Let her know that you still hope to spend time with her and be friends, especially if you both have mutual friends and will likely see each other often. [8] X Research source Try saying something like, “I know this sucks, but I hope we can still hang out. I really appreciate our friendship, but I understand if you need some time.” It may be awkward for a bit, but eventually, things may go back to normal and you can spend time around each other without it being weird."

      "title": "A hug or an inside joke could make her feel better.",
      "content": "A hug or an inside joke could make her feel better. After you tell her how you feel, she may understandably be hurt and a little upset. Try not to end the conversation on a bad note or by walking away and leaving her alone. Instead, try to offer some consolation like a hug. If you both have a bunch of inside jokes, try to make her laugh. Do whatever you can to end things positively. [9] X Research source For instance, if you’re both fans of the TV show The Office , you could quote a line from the show like, “I am ready to be hurt again” or “Oh how the turntables.” If she’s really upset, it may be best for you to give her some time and space."

      "content": "Wait at least a week before you hang out with her. Allow her to emotionally recover from the news. [10] X Expert Source Cherlyn Chong Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 21 June 2019. Don’t ignore her or avoid her, but try to give her at least a week to get over it. After that, if she’s comfortable, you can spend time with her and things may be back to the way they were before she started having feelings for you. [11] X Research source Keep in mind she may not be comfortable being around you. If that’s the case, respect her wishes and give her space. If she still continues to pursue you after you've told her how you feel, you can be more direct about your lack of interest and set boundaries around your time together. Reader Poll: We asked 488 wikiHow readers about how they’d handle a girl continuing to pursue them after rejection, and 58% of them agreed that they would set clear boundaries and communicate their disinterest .

Kissing, flirting, or hooking up with her could really mess with her emotions, especially if you just told her that you don’t have romantic feelings for her. However, if you do start to feel attracted to her, tell her about it! Just don’t hook up with her and then continue to say that you don’t want to be with her. [13] X Research source"

If you haven’t spent much time with her or if you were set up for a date and things didn’t seem to be going anywhere, you can send a text to tell her how you feel. Just type out a simple, direct text that is kind and clearly says that you aren’t interested in a romantic relationship. [14] X Research source For instance, you text her something like, “Hey, I had a great time, but I don’t think there’s a connection here,” or “Hi! Thanks for dinner, but I don’t think there’s a lot of chemistry between us.”"

But it could really hurt her feelings and just isn’t the right thing to do. If she likes you, but you don’t feel the same way, just tell her. She may not like it at first, but if you’re honest, she’ll eventually move on. [15] X Research source Ghosting her can make you seem like a jerk, especially if you have mutual friends."
