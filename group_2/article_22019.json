      "content": "Create fun outfits. Don't think of it as \"dress up.\" Think of it as creating new outfits that scream \"you!\" Play around with your clothing, trying out different items in ways you don't normally wear them. You can even put on some music and have a mini fashion show once you get some looks you like. Try some new accessories, or layer clothing you don't normally layer. Add scarves, and try tying them in creative ways. You can even tie large scarves into summer shirts! You could also try mixing and matching clothing with a sibling or a parent. Just make sure you're not doing it without their permission. Ask them before they leave the house."

      "content": "Make jewelry. If you've got beads and things to make jewelry, haul it all out. No one's around to tell you you're making a mess or in the way. Use the internet to come up with some new designs or stick to making your own amazing creations. If you don't have beads already, you can make your own from magazines. Simply cut strips into long triangles, then roll them over a toothpick, gluing as you go. Another way to make beads is to start with a round plastic bottle with no ridges. Cut off the top and bottom, and then slit it down the side. Cut 5-inch strips of plastic in horizontal lines from the top. The width you cut is the width of the bead. Color on the strip with permanent marker in whatever design you want. Use needle-nose pliers (pliers with a skinny tip) to grab one end of the strip, and then wrap the strip around itself, creating a bead shape. Trap the other end with the needle-nose pliers, and then heat up the bead with a hair dryer on hot, turning the bead to heat the whole thing. Be careful, the bead will be hot. You can use another pair of pliers to turn it or wait until it cools. Once the bead is sealed, it's done. [1] X Research source Just be sure to clean up the mess before your parents get home!"

Try making a card for a friend, or creating a scrapbook page with printed out photos. You could also make bookmarks or try your hand at origami. To make a simple card, fold a piece of card stock or brightly colored paper in half. Decorate the front with drawings, or cut out shapes in other colors. Glue or tape them on to create a design."

      "content": "Create a basic science experiment. Science can be fun, especially when you use things you already have around your house. You can find any number of experiments on the internet to try at home, and you won't even realize you're learning something interesting about the world. For instance, try making a hoop glider. You'll need an index card or some other type of stiff paper, as well as a straight straw and some tape. Cut the card into 3 pieces. Each piece should be an inch long by 5 inches long. Curl the first strip into a loop, overlapping the edges. Tape it together. Make a larger loop with the other two pieces, by overlapping the edges and taping them together. Tape the small loop on one end the straw, with the straw inside the loop. Tape the other loop on the other end, once again with the straw inside the loop. Hold the straw at the bottom with the loops up, and toss it across the room like a paper airplane. [2] X Research source To get into the experimental mood, try other configurations. Will a stir stick work as well as a straw? What about different size loops? What if you move the hoops around on the straw? What happens?"

      "content": "Write a story or poem. If you've never tried your hand at writing much, now's as good a time as any to try. If you don't know where to get started, think about some of your favorite stories. What do you like about them? Maybe the story has a great main character or the plot is really interesting and action-packed. If you know what kind of stories you like, it can help you when you start writing. For poems, try a descriptive poem. Think about a really good memory. What made it good? Use all your senses to describe the day. Also, don't be afraid to use similes or metaphors. Similes and metaphors are when you describe one thing by comparing it to something else that is seemingly different on the outside. Similes use \"like\" or \"as,\" while metaphors don't. For instance, if you wanted to describe the sun, you could say, \"The sun was like a giant yolk in the sky,\" which is a simile comparing the sun to an egg yolk. A metaphor would be \"The sun was a giant yolk in the sky,\" since it doesn't use \"like\" or \"as.\""

      "content": "Make a facial scrub. All you need for a facial scrub is some cooking oil, sugar, and a bit of salt. Olive oil is a good choice, but coconut oil would work fine if you melt it in the microwave a little. Sea salt is also better than regular salt. Mix a tablespoon or two with enough sugar and a dash or two of salt to make thick concoction. If you heat the coconut oil, make sure to test it first so you don't put hot oil on your face. Use a pinky to test it. To use the facial scrub, rub it on your face in gentle circles, avoiding your eyes. Don't rub for longer than a minute or two, as you don't want to take too much skin off. When you're done, simply wash it off. Making face masks can also be a fun thing to do!"

You can also look up fun nail designs on the internet to try yourself. [3] X Research source Make sure you don't make a mess. Nail polish can be difficult to remove from surfaces, especially once it dries. Wipe up any spills right away."

The point is to choose something that you find relaxing and enjoyable, and then let yourself soak in the warmth. Pick a candle in a soothing scent like lavender or jasmine or even use bath salts in one of those scents. [4] X Research source You can also just pick a scent you enjoy. Add in some bubble bath for extra fun."

Messing around with your hair can be silly and fun, plus you may find a new hairdo that rocks your world. [5] X Research source Try a French braid if you've never done one. Gather a small portion of your hair at the top of your head. Divide it into 3 equal parts. Pull the right piece over the middle piece, making it the middle piece. Then pull the left one over the middle piece, making it the middle piece. Now, add a little bit of your loose hair to each of the sections. For instance, gather a bit of hair starting near you left ear, and pull it into the left section. Pull from the middle for the middle section, and the right for the right section. Make sure you're gathering hair evenly. Repeat the process, braiding and adding hair until you reach your neck, where you should add any remaining hair and continue braiding. Use a hair tie to hold it together."

Stick to some basic, so it'll be easy to learn and you won't hurt yourself. You can look up videos of how to do basic moves on the internet. Try a standing forward fold. Place your feet about shoulder-width. Place your arms folded over the top of your head, with each hand grabbing the other arm near the elbow. Bend over at the waist, going as far forward as you feel comfortable doing. Hold the position for a minute or two before moving on to another one. You can bend your knees a little if it helps. [6] X Research source Move into downward-facing dog. You can easily move from a standing forward fold to downward-facing dog. All you need to do is put your hands flat on the ground in front of you. Your arms should end up straight. As you move into this position, move your feet back. Your legs should also be straight. You should basically make an \"A\" shape with your body. Hold this position for a minute or two. [7] X Research source Go into warrior I pose. From downward-facing dog, step forward with your right leg, bringing it between your arms. Turn your left leg in a bit as you lift your torso up until it is straight above your legs. Push your hands into the air above your head, reaching up. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Try learning a jump-rope routine. You may think jumping rope is just for kids, but it can be a lot of fun even for teenagers like yourself. You just have to make it a little harder for yourself then you did when you were a kid. Also, it will really get your heart pumping, and it's fun to jump in rhythm to an upbeat song. Once you get a rhythm going, trying jumping on just one foot, then switching to the other. You could also try alternating feet. Another option is criss-crossing. Cross your arms in front of yourself as you jump, still bringing the rope under you. You could also try double turning the rope. That is, jump higher, and try to get the rope under you twice. Make sure you have enough room when jumping, as you need a lot of space. Also, be careful, as whipping the rope around can cause hurt if it hits your skin."

It can be just as fun to challenge yourself to a contest. Get into a plank, and time your plank. Next time around, try to beat your time by holding it for longer. To plank, lay flat on the floor, face-down. Raise your body above the floor, with your feet in a push-up position. Rest your upper body on your forearms. To do a proper plank, keep your body as straight as possible. Lifting your middle up makes it easier, but it's not a true plank. However, don't worry if you need to start with an easier position. You can always work into a harder plank later."

Streaming services like Amazon and Netflix have shows that teens loved in the 1980s and 1990s, and now you can view them anytime. While you may find them a little cheesy, you'll get a fun glimpse at another time. If your family has a subscription, all you have to do is pick a show and go. [9] X Research source"

You could play games on the Cartoon Network's website ( http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/games/index.html ) or National Geographic's website ( http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/games/ ). You could also visit national sites where you could explore history and science, such as the Library of Congress' digital collections ( https://www.loc.gov/collections/ ), NASA's section for students ( http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/index.html ), or the Smithsonian's digital collections ( http://www.si.edu/Collections )."
