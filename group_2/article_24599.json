      "title": "Choose a program based on the airline you frequently fly.",
      "content": "Choose a program based on the airline you frequently fly. Star Alliance is made up of 28 different airline programs that you can earn travel rewards through. Because of this, you don’t apply for a Star Alliance membership, but you instead enroll in 1 of the 28 programs. You can choose any one that you want, but it’s best to go with the one that you have the easiest access to and/or the one that’s provided by the airline you fly the most. [2] X Research source The programs vary based on airline and country. If you live in the United States, for example, then you may want to enroll in United Airlines’ MileagePlus program."

Once you’ve started filling out the enrollment form, simply proceed as you’re directed to. Depending on the program you choose to enroll in, you may need to read and agree to terms and conditions.

      "content": "Fly 10,000−35,000 miles (−56,000 km) every 1-2 years to earn Silver status. Through Star Alliance, you can earn 1 of 2 different elevated statuses if you fly often enough. Silver is the lower of the 2, and can be achieved in various ways, depending on your program’s specifications. However, no matter the program, you have to fly a certain number of miles within a certain amount of time to qualify. The minimum amount of miles you must fly ranges from 10,000 miles (16,000 km) to 35,000 miles (56,000 km). Silver status members have the following added benefits: [5] X Research source Priority reservations waitlist: If the flight you want to go on is already booked, you will be placed high on the waitlist for the flight, in case anyone cancels their booking. Priority airport standby: If your travel plans change or you want to go on an earlier flight and you need to fly standby, you’ll be granted higher priority on the standby list if the new flight is full."

Lounge access: You and 1 additional guest who is a member of Star Alliance have access to all 1,000 of the Star Alliance airport lounges, regardless of the class you travel in. Priority baggage handling: Your luggage is prioritized so that it’s one of the first bags to be brought out to the baggage claim area, allowing you to leave the airport faster. Extra baggage allowance: You’re allowed 44 pounds (20 kg) of extra weight in your bag, or a second bag, without any additional charge. Priority check-in: You can check in for your flights at the specially marked “priority” counter, where the lines are generally shorter.
