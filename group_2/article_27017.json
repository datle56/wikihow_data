      "title": "Add six drops of a base note essential oil to a measuring cup.",
      "content": "Add six drops of a base note essential oil to a measuring cup. Use a pipette or the oil lid’s built-in dropper to measure the drops. Base notes are the underlying aroma of the cologne and last the longest of all the notes—upwards of six hours after applying. Pick carefully: A good base note ties the other scents together. [1] X Research source Base notes tend to be musky or woody fragrances like vetiver, sandalwood, tonka bean, patchouli, vanilla, amyris, muhuhu, oud, and ylang ylang. For any DIY fragrance, most sources recommend a ratio of 20 percent base notes, 50 percent middle notes, and 30 percent top notes. This ratio also depends on the strength of the scents you’re using. You can experiment to find out which ratio works best for your cologne. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a middle note essential oil, add 15 drops, and whisk.",
      "content": "Select a middle note essential oil, add 15 drops, and whisk. Middle notes are the heart of the cologne. They last around 20-60 minutes, emerging as the top note fades. They frequently include herbal or floral scents such as rose, fennel, and lavender. [3] X Research source Other middle notes include sage, geranium, lavender, jasmine, and cinnamon. Cinnamon and other spice oils can be skin irritants, so use them in smaller amounts than other oils. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a top note essential oil and add nine drops.",
      "content": "Pick a top note essential oil and add nine drops. Top notes are the cologne’s first impression and last the shortest amount of time, only 5-15 minutes. They’re usually sharp scents that you’ll notice right away—for example, citrus oils like lemon and tree scents like pine. [5] X Research source Top notes to consider are grapefruit, peppermint, spruce, eucalyptus, blood orange, basil, neroli, tangerine, ginger, bergamot, and yuzu. Certain oils, like peppermint and spearmint have a particularly strong odor. Use them in smaller quantities, regardless of your ratio. For a more top-note heavy cologne, add 20 drops of a top note oil, 15 drops of a middle note oil, and 10 drops of a base note oil (44/33/22 percent ratio)."

      "content": "Add 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of perfumer’s alcohol and whisk. For a standard cologne concentration, you’ll want a ratio of five to ten percent essential oils to 90 to 95 percent alcohol base. The alcohol should be high proof—you can use perfumer’s alcohol or grain alcohol. [6] X Research source Alcohol is used in fragrances to dilute and carry the scents. Dilution is desirable because it helps the blend combine faster. Because alcohol evaporates quickly, it helps carry the scent off your skin when applied. [7] X Research source Witch hazel or rubbing alcohol are common substitutes for alcohol as the base liquid. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Funnel your blend into a perfume bottle and age it. Secure the lid tightly and give the spray bottle a shake for a final mix. Let the cologne sit for 48 to 72 hours in a cool, dark place. [9] X Research source Shake the spray bottle again after 48 hours to help the contents mix. Some DIYers use a dark glass bottle for aging and a separate glass spray bottle for use, but many age their homemade cologne directly in the spray bottle."

      "content": "Add glycerin and distilled water to dilute. You don’t need much vegetable glycerin — 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) will do to help emulsify the mixture. As for distilled water, you can add 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) to dilute your cologne (especially if you have sensitive skin), but you can also leave it out for a stronger scent. [10] X Research source Homemade cologne should last for around six months, although distilled water shortens the shelf life to two to three months. Be sure to store your creation in a cool, dark place like a bathroom cabinet. [11] X Research source"

Consider combining douglas fir essential oil and cedarwood essential oil base notes with an herbal middle note like basil or sage . Top with a bright top note like lemongrass . [12] X Research source Basil, along with some other scents, can be considered a top or middle note; these note categorizations are subjective and not every oil fragrance fits neatly in one category."

      "title": "Cologne has a lower fragrance concentration than perfume.",
      "content": "Cologne has a lower fragrance concentration than perfume. A proper eau de cologne has three to five percent fragrance oils, while an eau de parfum has 15 to 20 percent essential oils. While some people believe that cologne is for men and perfume is for women, this is untrue. Both fragrance types are made for (and can be worn by) either gender. [16] X Research source Colognes tend to feature musky, woody, and earthy scents more than perfumes, which emphasize florals and citrus notes."

      "title": "Prep your skin before applying cologne.",
      "content": "Prep your skin before applying cologne. To make your cologne last longer, start by applying shortly after a warm shower or bath. The steam will open your pores to absorb the fragrance. After washing up, apply a body lotion or cream to your body to moisturize—hydrated skin holds fragrance better than dry skin. [17] X Research source Pick an unscented lotion to avoid it clashing with the scent of your DIY cologne. Use a dab of petroleum jelly on pulse points where you intend to spray your cologne for extra moisture—and to prevent body oils from breaking the fragrance."

    {
      "title": "Spray pulse points, hair, and clothing.",
      "content": "Spray pulse points, hair, and clothing. Instead of just spritzing the air around you, target pulse points like the back of the ears, the base of the throat, and the wrists. Since these areas of the body are the warmest, they’ll help your scent stay strong. The same goes for hair and clothing, which have porosity and hold onto scents better than skin. [18] X Research source Consider your hairstyle and fabric type before spraying. Some colognes will damage certain fabrics. Spritz an unnoticeable corner of the fabric to test for damage. As for hair, you can spritz some on a comb before styling."
