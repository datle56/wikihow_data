Fold the paper in half lengthwise so the paper looks like a long rectangle. Press crease the fold with your fingernail before unfolding the paper again.

Press along the fold with your fingernail so the fold stays in place. Repeat the fold along the other top corner so the top of your paper forms a point. [2] X Research source Make sure the crease points toward you when you’re folding your paper airplane or else you’ll fold the wrong corners."

Crease the paper with your knuckle or fingernail. Flip the paper airplane over to create the wing on the other side. Once both sides are creased, unfold them slightly so the plane is flat on top. [5] X Research source Make sure your wings are symmetrical to one another so your plane stays level when you throw it."
