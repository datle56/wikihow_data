      "title": "Know when to hoe.",
      "content": "Know when to hoe. Hoeing weeds is an important part of managing flowerbeds, vegetable gardens, and fields. You should always hoe weeds at first sight. Waiting until the weeds take over your garden will make hoeing more difficult. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hoe when the soil is dry.",
      "content": "Hoe when the soil is dry. The best time to hoe is when the soil in your field or garden is as dry as possible. This creates what some gardeners refer to as dust mulch, which can help prevent new weeds from germinating. Try hoeing your garden early in the morning, before you water the plants."

    {
      "title": "Stay as upright as possible.",
      "content": "Stay as upright as possible. Before you begin to hoe, stand tall. Pick up the hoe by its handle and stand it on the ground beside you. Take notice of your upright position. Try to maintain as close to an upright position as possible while you hoe. This will make the process easier on your back. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a sweeping motion to slice off weed tops.",
      "content": "Use a sweeping motion to slice off weed tops. Grab the hoe and make sweeping motions over the tops of weeds, much like you would do if using a broom to sweep a floor. Make broad, fluid sweeping motions to slice the tops off the weeds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the weed stem just below the soil.",
      "content": "Cut the weed stem just below the soil. You should aim to sweep your hoe just below the surface of the soil. This will result in cutting off the tops of the weeds at this level, which can prevent future weed growth. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Exercise caution and aim for accuracy.",
      "content": "Exercise caution and aim for accuracy. It is important that you are precise and cautious while hoeing weeds. An accidental sweep to the right might result in an accidental chop to your favorite flowers. Make sure the hoe passes easily and precisely between the rows of plants and does not disturb your flowers or crops."

    {
      "title": "Change hands frequently while hoeing.",
      "content": "Change hands frequently while hoeing. Hoeing weeds can be hard on your hands, arms, and back. Try to evenly distribute the labor on both sides of your body. You can easily do this by switching hands and arms frequently while hoeing. You can wear gloves while hoeing to protect your hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure the hoe is the right height.",
      "content": "Make sure the hoe is the right height. You should be able to stand upright while you hoe weeds. Make sure the handle of your hoe is long enough to allow you to stand while using it. If the hoe forces you to hunch over while hoeing, try to find a hoe with a longer handle."

      "content": "Control young weeds with a lightweight scuffle hoe. If you want to control young weeds that are popping up in a large area or amongst your rows of plants, try a lightweight scuffle hoe. A diamond, triangle, or stirrup hoe will work best on young weeds. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep large weeds under control with a field or grub hoe. If you are dealing with large weeds, you can use a variety of hoes to get the job done. Try a field or grub hoe. You can also use a Warren hoe or a standard American garden hoe. These hoes can also be used to make furrows and chop compost. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a short handle hoe in tight spaces. If you need to perform spot weeding, or if you need to remove weeds from a tight space, a hoe with a short handle will work well. You can also try using a circular hoe, collinear hoe, or any other hoe that is mounted on a short handle. [6] X Research source"
