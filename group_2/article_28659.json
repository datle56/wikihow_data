      "content": "Make a square to set the baking soda in. Tear a paper towel in half or tear off a square of plastic wrap, approximately 7 inches (17.8 cm) by 7 inches. Measure out about a tablespoon of baking soda and place it in the center of the paper towel or plastic wrap. Set aside. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the baking soda square inside the bottle.",
      "content": "Place the baking soda square inside the bottle. Pick up the paper towel or plastic wrap by the corners so that the baking soda is cupped inside. Stuff the cupped paper towel or plastic wrap just inside the mouth of the bottle so that the portion with the baking soda is just past the mouth and the corners of the paper towel or plastic wrap are poking out of the top of the bottle. [2] X Research source Don’t let the paper towel/plastic wrap drop all the way into the bottle."

      "title": "Find a safe place to set off the bomb.",
      "content": "Find a safe place to set off the bomb. You want a place with plenty of open space, away from people, animals, and property. Keep in mind that you’ll be throwing the bottle, so there should be enough open space for you to be able to throw the bottle a safe distance away from you."

      "title": "Take the bottle and the bottle cap outside.",
      "content": "Take the bottle and the bottle cap outside. Bring them to the place where you plan to set off the bomb. Push the paper towel or plastic wrap all the way into the bottle. Screw on the cap and vigorously shake the bottle. As soon as you feel the bottle begin to harden from the internal pressure, throw the bottle up and away from you. The bottle should explode when it hits the ground. Be very careful when shaking the bottle because it could potentially explode in your hands. Take the proper precautions."

      "title": "Poke a hole in a Mentos.",
      "content": "Poke a hole in a Mentos. Take a single Mentos and poke a hole through the center. You can use a nail, safety pin, pencil, ballpoint pen, or similar to create the hole. If you need help getting the object through the center of the Mentos, you can gently tap it with a hammer to push it through. Be careful not to hurt yourself. You can also try tying the string or floss around the Mentos rather than through it, but be sure it’s tied very tightly."

      "content": "Place a string through the Mentos. Run about four inches of string (sewing thread or floss works best) through the hole in the Mentos. Hold the string by the two ends so that the Mentos is suspended in the center."

      "content": "Wait for someone to open the soda. When they unscrew the cap, the Mentos will drop into the soda and cause the soda to explode out of the bottle. (Be prepared for a mess.) [3] X Research source"
