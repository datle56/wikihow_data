      "content": "Clip this edge of each circle of the bolster pillow, .5 inches (1.27 cm) apart, all the way around. Clip up to the stitched line, but not through it. The clipped edges will make it easier for you to sew the pillow together in the end."

      "content": "Find the circumference of the 2 circles by measuring the diameter. You can do this by multiplying the diameter of the circle by 3.14 for the circumference. You need this measurement to find out how much fabric to cut for the middle of the bolster pillow. For example, if the diameter of the circles is 5 inches (12.7 cm), the circumference is 15.7 inches (39.9 cm), or 5 x 3.14."

      "content": "Pull on the long row of stitches on the circle to gather it. This is so that it fits inside the rounded edge of the rectangle. If you don't, you'll have excess fabric on the edges of your pillow."

      "content": "Start sewing the circle to the edge of the rectangle. Use the row of long stitches on the fabric as a guide as you sew the pillow, so that they will be concealed when the decorative pillow is finished. Repeat with the second circle if you are using the polyester batting. Don't sew the second side all up! Leave a 3-inch (7.62 cm) gap so you can add the batting to the bolster pillow."
