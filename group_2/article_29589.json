To tell whether or not your bottle is made out of PET or PETE plastic, turn it upside down and look at the bottom. If there is a recycling symbol with a 1 inside it, it's PET/PETE plastic. [6] X Research source Turn on your iron and make sure the steam setting is turned off. Consider wrapping a sheet of fabric or tin foil over the bottom of the iron to keep it clean. Press the bottle, cut-side-down against the bottom of the iron. Every couple of seconds, lift the bottle to see the progress. As the plastic warms up, it will start to curl in on itself, creating a neat rim. Turn the iron off and let the bottle cool before you start decorating it."
