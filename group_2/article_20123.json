The FCC offers a list of authorized COLEMS on its Website, along with their respective fees. To access this, go to the Examinations page and select \"Testing Managers, Locations, Schedules, and Fees.\" Once you have decided which COLEM you will use for your exam, contact them to check when the next scheduled exam is and how to register. Many COLEMs offer online testing, in addition to in person exams. This may be beneficial to you if there are no testing facilities in your area. [5] X Research source In some cases, if you pass the exam, the COLEM will electronically file your application for you. Otherwise, they will give you a Proof of Passing Certificate (PPC) that needs to be included with your license application."
