      "title": "Measure the space.",
      "content": "Measure the space. Before you try to install your washer and dryer, measure the area where you intend to put them to ensure your appliances will fit. Keep in mind that your dryer will need about 6 inches (15 cm) of additional space in the back for venting. Also, consider how much space you will need for opening and closing the doors. Doors are typically around 20–30 inches (51–76 cm), in case your particular appliance doesn’t list the dimensions on the spec sheet. Play it safe and give yourself at least 30 inches (76 cm) to open the doors."

      "title": "Check and clean your dryer vent.",
      "content": "Check and clean your dryer vent . Electric and gas dryers both require venting. Unless your house has never been lived in, it is important to make sure your dryer vent is free and clear of all debris, as a blocked vent may be a fire hazard. Buy an inexpensive vent brush . Starting indoors, insert the brush a few inches and spin it. Then, remove the brush and clean off the bristles. Repeat until the bristles come out clean. After cleaning the indoor side of the vent, go outside and remove the vent hood to ensure it is clear of all lint and debris. It's a good idea to clean your vent every year. In addition to the safety issues that a blocked vent can cause, drying clothes with a blocked vent can damage your dryer and void your warranty. [2] X Research source Where is my dryer vent? The dryer vent is the port in the wall where you connect the dryer hose. That port leads outside and its how your dryer gets rid of any carbon dioxide and gas fumes. The dryer vent is not the same thing as the dryer hose."

      "title": "Make sure you have the right outlet for your dryer.",
      "content": "Make sure you have the right outlet for your dryer. Electric and gas dryers require different types of outlets because they have different electrical requirements. Confirm that the dryer you’re installing has a plug that matches the dedicated outlet for it in the wall. If there’s a mismatch, contact an electrician to swap the outlet out. [3] X Research source Here are the requirements: Electric dryers: These require 240-volt, 30-amp circuits. These outlets are usually round and have three square-shaped slots on the top and sides, a circular pin in the middle, and an L-shaped slot at the bottom. Do you see a 3-prong outlet? This is an outlet for an electric dryer from before 1996. It doesn’t have a ground, the way modern 4-prong outlets do. Contact an electrician to have this outlet updated. Gas dryers: Gas dryers require “normal” 120-volt circuits. These are the typical interior outlets you find around most homes."

      "title": "Carefully slide the dryer into place.",
      "content": "Carefully slide the dryer into place. Leave yourself a couple of feet of space behind the dryer so you can stand comfortably while hooking up the vent hose. If you’re using metal ducting instead of a flexible hose, you'll need to move the dryer all the way into place and attach the ducting while standing alongside the machine."

      "title": "Attach the vent hose or duct to your machine.",
      "content": "Attach the vent hose or duct to your machine. Place one end of the vent hose over the vent hole in the back of the dryer. It is extremely important that this hose is installed securely with no tears or rips, since it’s responsible for channeling dangerous fumes and carbon dioxide away from your home. Slide the hose over the port on the machine, and use hose clamps to secure it in place. [4] X Research source If space permits, use a metal vent duct, as ribbed plastic and aluminum hoses can catch lint and clog more easily. Joints in the metal duct should be sealed with duct tape, as screws may also catch lint. The end should fit snugly into the machine, so no clamps or tape should be needed. The straighter the vent, the better it will function, as lint can gather in areas where the hose bends. This is another good reason to use metal ducting rather than a plastic or flexible aluminum hose. If using a plastic vent hose, slip a circular dryer clamp over the hose to hold it securely in place. Make sure your clamps are the right size and fit tightly. Many hoses come with clamps that are made to fit."

      "title": "Run some water through the faucets.",
      "content": "Run some water through the faucets. Place a bucket or tub underneath the hot and cold water outlets you'll be hooking up to and run some water through each. This will clear any debris that might clog your valve screens. Afterwards, make sure the faucets are turned completely off. If you do not have faucets you’re hooking up to (probably because you have dedicated supply lines installed), don’t worry about running any water."

Most hoses only have a reach of a few inches; you may need to leave yourself room on the side to hook it up."

Make sure the hot water hose (red) is connected to the hot water faucet (red) and the cold water hose (blue) is connected to the cold line (blue). Screw the valves in clockwise all the way until they won’t turn any further. [6] X Research source If your hoses aren’t color-coded, look for a little H or C on the hoses somewhere. These stand for “hot” and “cold.” The end of the hose that has a filter screen in the coupling attaches to your faucet. If the filter screen is not yet in the hose, insert one into the coupling before attaching the hose to the wall. The screens should be included with your hoses. [7] X Research source Turn the coupling clockwise by hand until tight. Then, with a pair of pliers, tighten the coupling by rotating it another quarter to half a turn. Do not over-tighten, as this may cause leaks. [8] X Research source If the valves are old, you may need to use a wrench or channel locks to fully tighten the couplings at the water lines."

If the hoses didn’t come attached to the machine (they usually are these days), install them yourself after hooking the supply lines up to the faucet or water supply in the wall. Make certain the correct hose is attached to the correct inlet. [9] X Research source The ends of the hoses with plain rubber washers attach to the washing machine. If the couplings do not have washers in them, insert the washers first, otherwise your hose will leak. As with the screens, washers should be included with the hoses if they’re not already inserted."

Depending on your plumbing, you'll need to feed the hose into a drain on the floor, the wall, or into a laundry sink, or there may be a rigid pipe that extends down to a floor drain. [11] X Research source Your washer should come with accessories such as straps and/or a hook to help you secure the drain pipe. Consult the manual for your machine to learn how to use these parts correctly in conjunction with your plumbing. Make sure to leave a space of several inches between the end of the hose and the bottom of the drain or sink. Otherwise, your machine may siphon drained water back up the drain pipe."
