      "content": "Water, broth, sports drinks or ginger tea can help. Nausea and mild stomach pain after a night of drinking is usually caused by an irritated stomach lining and too much acid in the stomach. [1] X Research source These soothing drinks will help get your stomach back to normal: Plain water often does the job by itself. Sip as slowly as you need to. Thin vegetable broth or an isotonic sports drink treat multiple issues at once by restoring some salt to your system as you hydrate. Ginger tea is a common folk remedy for nausea with some decent evidence behind it, though a few unlucky people react the opposite way.

      "content": "These drinks worsen pain, but may help with nausea. Sparkling water or other carbonated drinks are a common home remedy for nausea and acid reflux, but can make indigestion and other stomach pain worse. Similarly, the sugars in fruit juice or soda can settle an upset stomach and help with other hangover symptoms, but it's best to avoid them while you are in pain. [4] X Research source Carbonated drinks, and especially sodas, can be quite acidic. However, this has surprisingly little effect on acid reflux and overall stomach acidity for most people. [5] X Research source Some people do react badly, so start with small sips and see how it goes. Avoid caffeine and dairy products. These drinks can worsen stomach pain and nausea after a night of drinking. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As with any drug, don't take more than one at a time before talking to your doctor. Here's a quick guide: Antacids are widely available and work okay. The options that contain sodium bicarbonate (such as Alka-Seltzer) are less effective but have fewer side effects. [8] X Expert Source David Schechter, MD Family Medicine Practitioner Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. [9] X Research source H2 histamine blockers (also called acid blockers) are a great choice. Ask a pharmacist or look for the generic drug names cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, or famotidine. [10] X Research source Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole are great for multi-day symptoms, but not so much for immediate relief.

      "content": "Baking soda is a mediocre but easy to find antacid. If you can't make it to the pharmacy, this antacid might be sitting in your kitchen. This isn't as effective as most other antacids, but it helps a little with heartburn or indigestion from too much stomach acid. [12] X Research source Try half a teaspoon (3 mL) of baking soda mixed into half a cup (125 mL) of water. [13] X Research source This is only recommended as a short-term home remedy. It is not safe for people on medically necessary low-sodium diets, and it can make it harder to absorb other prescription medicine."

      "content": "Aspirin and ibuprofen can irritate your stomach. Many people turn to these painkillers to help with a pounding hangover headache. But if your stomach is in pain, avoid drugs that irritate it further like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and other NSAIDs. Small doses of acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol or Tylenol) are a better choice while your stomach is hurting. [19] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Warning: acetaminophen can damage your liver, as does alcohol. If you are a heavy drinker or frequently have hangovers, this is not a good solution. Talk to your doctor about treatments that can protect your stomach and make NSAIDs a safer option."
