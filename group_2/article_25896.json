Work 3-4 weeks before the severe heat of summer or the cold of winter so new grass has time to establish before the weather turns.

Look for areas in your yard where water pools up, and hire a professional plumber to inspect if there are any damaged pipes. Have any broken or damaged pipes repaired before you level your lawn to ensure the low spots don’t form again. [3] X Research source Contact a professional landscaper to determine the source of your drainage issues if there aren’t any damaged pipes. You may need to fix poor drainage or have your lawn re-graded."

Use a rake to sift through the soil and break apart any clumps larger than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) so it spreads across your lawn evenly. [4] X Research source If your yard already has sandy soil, it’s okay to just use only sand. [5] X Expert Source Keith Souza Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021."

      "content": "Water your lawn to compact the soil. Use a shower attachment on your hose and lightly water the section of lawn that you’re filling in. Make sure the soil feels soft underneath your grass instead of hard and dry. [6] X Research source The water helps your soil settle so you’re able to see the actual depth of the holes you need to fill."

      "content": "Remove the grass if the hole is deeper than 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm). Deep soil that’s covering grass can cause decay and harm the rest of your lawn. Measure how deep the holes in your yard are to see if they are deeper than 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm). If they are, push the blade of a shovel around the patch to cut and remove the grass from the surface. [7] X Research source If the hole is shallower than 2 inches (5.1 cm), then it’s okay to put soil directly on the grass. Save the grass if you can because you may be able to replant it when you’re finished filling in the holes."

Spread a few shovelfuls of the soil from your wheelbarrow into ruts or holes in your yard. Try to spread the soil evenly across the holes in the area. Tamp the dirt into the holes with the back of your shovel. [8] X Research source It’s okay if the soil isn’t perfectly flat when you shovel it in since you’ll level it out later. Cutting your grass as low as possible can help you get a more accurate view of your lawn’s level. [9] X Expert Source Keith Souza Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021."

If the low spots in your yard aren’t completely filled, add a little bit more lawn soil and level it out. Keep working the soil throughout your lawn until you can see the grass poking through the top-dressing you just added. [10] X Research source Make sure your layer of top dressing is less than 1 in (2.5 cm) thick or else it could cause your existing grass to die. Alternatively, run a manual leveler over your grass to smooth it out. [11] X Expert Source Keith Souza Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021."

Leave your yard alone for 1-2 days so the soil has time to compact before inspecting if it’s level again.

First, try fitting the old patch of grass over the spot and tamping it down so the roots make good contact with the soil. If the old patch doesn’t fit, then plant new seeds. [13] X Research source Use sod if you don’t want to wait for new grass to grow in. Cut the sod into the shape of the bare spot and press it down onto the soil. Use the same type of grass as the rest of your lawn so your yard looks uniform."

Set your level on top of the lumber and check the bubble. If the bubble is in the center of the tube on your level, then you’re finished flattening your lawn. If it isn’t, find the low spots and fill them in with more top-dressing. [14] X Research source If your lumber doesn’t span the entire area you leveled, you may get an inaccurate reading."

Get a roller for yourself, or contact your local gardening or landscaping stores to see if they offer equipment rentals so you’re able to save some money. [16] X Research source Steel garden rollers are heavier and flatten your lawn better, but they’re tougher to maneuver. Polyurethane rollers are lighter and easier to move around, but they are less durable and could get punctured."

      "title": "Water your lawn before you roll it.",
      "content": "Water your lawn before you roll it. Use a sprinkler attachment on your garden hose to wet your grass. Run the sprinkler on your lawn for about 20-30 minutes so your lawn doesn’t get too wet. Just avoid watering your lawn so much that it turns muddy since you’ll have to wait for it to dry before rolling. The water moistens the soil so it’s softer and easier to flatten with your roller."

      "content": "Fill the roller barrel ¼-full with water. Garden rollers are hollow so you can transport them easily, but they’re not heavy enough to flatten your lawn yet. Turn the roller on its side so the fill hole points up, and use your hose to fill it with water. Once it’s ¼-full, turn off your hose and seal the cap. [17] X Research source Refer to the instruction manual if you have trouble locating the fill hole on your roller. It’s okay to fill the entire roller with water, but it will be extremely heavy and could be difficult to maneuver around your yard."

      "content": "Pull the roller across your lawn in long strips. Start at the end of your yard furthest from your home. Slowly walk across the length of your lawn and pull the roller behind you to flatten the raised areas of your yard. When you reach the other end of your lawn, turn the roller around and start a new strip that slightly overlaps the first one. Keep working across your lawn until you’ve rolled it completely. [18] X Research source Try pushing the roller in front of you if it’s easier to maneuver. Take breaks frequently so you don’t get sore or worn out. If your yard has a hill or slope, work across it horizontally rather than moving up and down. The weight of the roller could make it difficult to push uphill. If your yard isn’t leveling out, try adding more water to the roller so there’s more weight pressing down on the soil."

      "title": "Cut the grass and dig out soil from large bumps if they aren’t flattened.",
      "content": "Cut the grass and dig out soil from large bumps if they aren’t flattened. Walk over your lawn after you’ve rolled it to see if there are still any mounds left. If there are, use a shovel to cut into the grass. Try to peel back the grass around the mound, and dig out some of the soil from the mound. Fold the grass back down occasionally and tamp it down with the back of your shovel to check if the spot is level with the rest of your lawn. [19] X Research source Mounds that don’t flatten out with the roller are usually compacted and need to be removed by hand. If you can’t easily peel the grass back from the dirt, just cut out the section of your lawn with your shovel. When you’re finished, put the grass back over the patch or plant new grass seed on the bare soil."
