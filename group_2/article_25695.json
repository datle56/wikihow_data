      "content": "Toss chopped veggies in olive oil and roast them at 425 °F (218 °C). Roasting is an easy, healthy, and delicious way to cook just about any vegetable. Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut vegetables into bite-sized pieces, put them in a bowl, then coat them in 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of a healthy vegetable oil, such as olive, canola, or sesame. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper, then spread them on a baking sheet. Roast them in the oven until you can easily pierce them with a fork and they’re slightly browned or charred around the edges. [2] X Research source Roasting is especially good for root vegetables, like potatoes, carrots, and parsnips, but you can also roast things like brussels sprouts, cauliflower, zucchini, and bell peppers. Some vegetables take longer to roast than others. For instance, potatoes will roast a lot more slowly than something like asparagus. Most veggies will need to spend at least 15 minutes in the oven before they’re tender."

      "content": "Cook meats in the oven for a flavorful and tender result. You can cook almost any cut of meat in the oven. Preheat your oven to the recommended cooking temperature for about 20 minutes while your meat sits at room temperature to ensure even cooking. Season the outside of the meat with plenty of salt and pepper and set it in a wide roasting pan, preferably on a rack or a bed of vegetables. 30 minutes before your recipe says the meat is supposed to be ready, use a meat thermometer to see if it’s reached a safe internal temperature. [3] X Research source The amount of time it takes to roast a piece of meat, and the recommended cooking temperature, will vary depending on the type of meat and how big it is. Check the packaging or look online for recommendations. For example, some chefs recommend starting a beef tenderloin at 450 °F (232 °C) for the first 10 minutes, then cooking it at 275 °F (135 °C) until it reaches an internal temperature of 115–118 °F (46–48 °C). The cooking time will depend on the weight and thickness of the tenderloin. [6] X Research source Seasoning the meat with salt and pepper will give it flavor and help it stay juicy as it cooks. You can also lightly rub the surface with oil or butter to help the seasonings stick."

Cut some meat or tofu into bite-sized chunks and toss it into a skillet or wok at medium-high heat with convert 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of vegetable oil. Brown the meat (or cook it through, if it’s chicken, pork, or shrimp) and set it aside. Cook some chopped-up vegetables in the pan for 2-3 minutes, then return the meat to the pan and cover it with broth or sauce. Take it off the heat after 1 more minute, or once the sauce is bubbling hot! [7] X Research source You can either buy pre-made stir fry sauce, or make your own by combining 1 cup (240 mL) of chicken or vegetable broth, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (13 g) of sugar, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of rice wine vinegar. To make your stir fry extra flavorful, add in some aromatic veggies and let them fry for 30 seconds before you pour in the sauce. Some tasty options include garlic, shallots, onions, fresh ginger, chilies, and celery. You can also spice it up by adding fresh herbs at the very end of the cooking process, such as parsley, basil, cilantro, or chives."

      "content": "Simmer brown rice for 45 minutes if you want a simple side. To make simple brown rice, put 1 cup (about 180 grams) of rice in a strainer and rinse it with cool water to remove dust. Put the rice in a pan with 2 cups (470 mL) of water and 1 teaspoon (4.16 g) of salt, then bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, tightly cover the pot, and let the rice simmer for 45 minutes without stirring or checking on it. After 45 minutes, the water should be absorbed and your rice should be tender. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit with the cover on for 10-15 minutes. [8] X Research source Give the rice a more complex flavor by toasting it for a few minutes in oil before you add the water. Grain-based sides like rice, pasta, quinoa, or couscous are simple to cook and will nicely complement most meals. If you’re pressed for time, instant rice or couscous can be ready in just a few minutes! Simply follow the directions on the box. Serve your rice on the side with a meat and vegetable, toss a stir fry over it, or eat it with a fried or poached egg on top for a simple but nutritious meal!"

Dice up the vegetables into bite-sized pieces. Sauté hard veggies, like carrots, potatoes, or cauliflower, in a frying pan with a little butter or olive oil to soften them a little and bring out their flavor. Then, bring some broth or stock to a boil, add the veggies, and turn down the heat. Let your soup simmer for about an hour or until the veggies are nice and tender. [9] X Research source Your soup will take on the flavor of the vegetables, but you can also boost it by adding salt and pepper, fresh herbs, aromatics like garlic, onions, or bay leaves, or sweet and tangy diced tomatoes. Experiment around with different flavors to figure out what you like best! If you want some protein in your soup, brown some bite-sized chicken pieces in olive oil and add them to the soup along with the vegetables. Or, if you prefer non-meat proteins, add some tofu or beans."

Pour 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of water into the bottom of a stovetop steamer and put it on the stove at medium-high heat until it boils. Reduce the heat so the water goes down to a simmer (just bubbling slightly), then place your vegetables in the top part of the steamer and put on the lid. After a few minutes, check to see if you can easily pierce your veggies with a fork. Most vegetables will be ready within 5-10 minutes. [10] X Research source Really dense vegetables can take a lot longer to steam. For example, whole artichokes may take up to 40 minutes. Leafy greens like spinach will be done within about 3-5 minutes. You can speed up the steaming time for slower veggies, like potatoes or carrots, by chopping or slicing them before putting them in the steamer."

As you get more comfortable with basic cooking techniques, move beyond the basics of salt and black pepper and try a variety of other herbs, spices, aromatics, and other flavor-boosters. For example, you can: [11] X Research source Use lemon, vinegar, or other acidic flavors to brighten up the taste of your dishes and give them a little zing. Add a hint of heat with chilies or crushed red pepper. Impart a savory flavor with soy, oyster, or Worcestershire sauce. Give your dishes an instant flavor boost with an aromatic, such as garlic or shallots. Liven up your food with distinctive-tasting herbs, like basil, oregano, mint, or rosemary.

Avoid vegetables that are wilted, slimy, or squishy, and stick to meats that have a healthy looking color and a mild, pleasant odor. Purchasing fruits and vegetables that are in season will help ensure that you get good-quality ingredients. For example, in the U.S., the best time to get fresh corn is in the summer and fall, while asparagus is at its peak in the spring.
