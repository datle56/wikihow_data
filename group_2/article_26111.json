      "content": "Change your routines to avoid social media. Some people check their social media accounts as soon as they wake up, during breaks at work or school, and while falling asleep. Think about when you tend to look at social media, and then find another activity to fill that time. While eating meals, focus on the food. Think about the taste and texture. If you’re eating with others, talk to them instead of looking at your phone. When you feel like having a conversation with someone, do it in person. If nobody is around, try going to a café or other busy location where people may be available to chat. Keep your phone far away from you at night. Not only will this prevent you from using social media, but you may fall asleep more easily. [2] X Research source"
