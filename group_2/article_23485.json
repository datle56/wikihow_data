      "content": "Identify the appropriate category for your visa. If you are currently outside the US and want to immigrate into the US permanently, you must first acquire an immigrant visa. There are several categories of immigrant visa, each of which requires a different application form and supporting documentation. [3] X Research source The US prioritizes immigrant visas based on categories. The highest priority is given to immigrants who already have family in the US who are either US citizens or permanent residents. The next highest priority is given to immigrants who already have employment in the US. You can apply for a visa in other categories, such as an asylum visa. These visas are extremely limited. The number of available visas may be further limited depending on your current country. The wait list for a visa in these categories can sometimes be years long."

      "title": "Choose someone to sponsor your visa application.",
      "content": "Choose someone to sponsor your visa application. If you want to apply for an immigrant visa, you need a US citizen to sponsor you. If you're applying under the family visa category, that person will be a family member of yours who is a US citizen. For the employment-based category, your sponsor will typically be your prospective employer. If you are being sponsored by a family member, they must be a US citizen over 18 years of age. If the person sponsoring you has never sponsored an immigrant before, the two of you may need to take some time to read through the process and understand what's involved. An attorney who specializes in immigration law can help walk you through it. There are also nonprofit organizations that help immigrants."

The required forms your sponsor must complete and file are available for download from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. The forms include instructions for completing them and submitting them to USCIS.

      "content": "Wait for notification from the National Visa Center (NVC). If your petition is approved, USCIS will send it to the NVC for processing. The NVC collects your visa application, fees, and supporting documentation. Because there are a limited number of visas available each year in each category, it may be months or even years before you hear from the NVC. [5] X Research source The NVC notification includes instructions on the next steps to apply for an immigration visa. Read these instructions carefully and get assistance from an immigration lawyer or nonprofit agency if you don't understand them. Not following the instructions could delay the processing of your application, or result in your application being rejected. At this time, you can choose an agent to receive NVC communications on your behalf. This may be necessary if you move frequently, or do not have a stable permanent address. You can also serve as your own agent."

Most of the information you provide on your application must be supported with official documentation. When you've completed your application and gathered the required documents, send the entire package to the NVC. [6] X Research source It's a good idea to go through your application and documentation with an immigration lawyer before you submit it. You must pay fees of more than US$1,000. If your application is denied you won't get any of that money back, and you'll have to start the process all over again. In some countries, you'll use the Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC) to submit your application, fees, and documents, rather than mailing them. This process is more secure and saves time."

Do not take the form out of the envelope. You must deliver it to the consular office in a sealed envelope on the day of your interview. This medical examination is valid 6 months."

[8] X Research source During the interview, the officer will review your supporting documents and ask you questions about your application. If you are applying with a family member, typically they must attend the interview with you. You will find out at the end of the interview if your visa has been approved. If the consular officer needs additional documents or information before they can approve your visa, they'll let you know. Get those documents to them as soon as possible. The consular officer may deny your visa application. There usually is no appeal from a denial. You may be able to get your application reconsidered by another officer.

[10] X Trustworthy Source US Citizenship and Immigration Services U.S. government agency in charge of the naturalization and immigration systems Go to source For example, if you came to the US on a student visa and were later hired as a professor by your university, you could apply for an employment-based Green Card with the university as a sponsor. Green Cards are also issued to people here on a non-immigrant visa who fall in love with someone while in the US and decide to get married. All available categories are listed on the USCIS website.

If you're seeking an adjustment of status because you have a full-time job in the US, you would need documents proving your employment.
