      "content": "Try simply adding a black slide. This is an easy way to build a black screen directly into your presentation. This way, you don't have to worry about pressing the B button – you can plan for a dark screen when you want the audience to focus on your words, and then click onward to the next slide when you're ready to proceed. You can do this by adding a blank slide with a plain black background, or you can make the words fade out to black before you move on to the next slide."

      "content": "Review the presentation. Before you try to present this PowerPoint to a group of people, make sure that the screen goes black when you want it to go black. Click on the Slideshow icon on the bottom right-hand corner or the Slideshow – From the Beginning option on the panel at the top of the screen. Your computer screen should now look completely black except for a small set of pointer arrows in the bottom left corner. Unfortunately nothing can be done about that but from a distance they are not too visible."
