      "title": "Purchase high quality pork fat.",
      "content": "Purchase high quality pork fat. If you want to make the lard as healthy and beneficial as possible, you should purchase pork fat from a local farmer instead of a grocery store butcher. You can usually find a local farmer who raises pigs by asking around at your nearest farmer's market. You can also try small \"family run\" butchers or specialty markets."

    {
      "title": "Select the right cut of fat.",
      "content": "Select the right cut of fat. There are three main types of pork fat, and each type produces lard that is best used for different purposes. Back fat, also called fatback, comes from the back, shoulder, and rump of the pig and is located directly beneath the skin. It works well for sauteing and frying. Belly fat is rich and layered with meat. Bacon is actually cured pork belly. Rendered belly fat can also become lard used for frying, however. Leaf lard is fat located around the pig's kidneys. It is the cleanest fat and is the most suitable if you want to make lard used for pastries and baked goods."

    {
      "title": "Cut the fat into small cubes.",
      "content": "Cut the fat into small cubes. Use a very sharp knife to cut the fat into 1-inch (2.5-cm) strips. Cut across the strips crosswise to produce 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes. The pieces should be at least this small. The smaller they are, the easier it will be to render lard from them. Cut away as much meat and skin from the fat as you dice it, as well. Also note that it will be easiest to cut the fat if it has been chilled or partially frozen beforehand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider grinding the fat down further.",
      "content": "Consider grinding the fat down further. To produce even more rendered lard, put the cubes of fat through a meat grinder and grind them down into even smaller pieces. Alternatively, you could put the lard cubes into a food processor and slightly pulse them into shreds. Use no more than a handful at a time, however, since you could wear the motor out if you stress it with too much. You could skip the cutting and grinding process completely by asking the farmer or butcher to grind the fat down before you take it home."

      "content": "Preheat an oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius). The oven needs to be set to a low temperature to prevent the fat from burning as it renders."

      "title": "Pour a little water into a Dutch oven.",
      "content": "Pour a little water into a Dutch oven. Fill the pot with about 1/4 inch (0.625 cm) of cool to warm water. The water prevents the fat from browning too quickly at the start of the process. As the fat continues to cook, the water will evaporate, so it should not affect the quality of your lard. Use a cast iron Dutch oven for best results. If you do not have one, another deep, oven-safe pot would also suffice."

      "content": "Place in the hot oven for several hours. Stir the fat every 20 to 30 minutes or so. Remove the pot from the oven once the chunks stop giving off fat. This process will usually take at least two hours. That amount of time will increase depending on the size of your pot and the amount of fat you choose to render. It will likely be obvious once the fat has been rendered off. If you think the chunks look the same way they did 40 to 60 minutes earlier, you've probably gotten as much fat from them as possible."

[2] X Research source After the first hour, you should check on the fat every 20 to 30 minutes to make sure that it is not burning. Stir each time you check it. You may wish to ladle out some of the liquid fat throughout the process. Doing so can make it easier for the rest of the solid fat to melt down. The fat is ready once the cracklings (crisp residue) begin sinking to the bottom of the slow cooker. These cracklings should still be soft, however, and not crispy. The entire process will usually take two to eight hours, depending on the size of your slow cooker and the amount of fat being rendered."

      "title": "Add a little water.",
      "content": "Add a little water. Pour roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water over the fat inside the stockpot. You only need a little water. The water can help prevent the fat from burning during the initial stages, and it will evaporate from the stockpot as the fat continues to heat up."

Increase the heat to medium, then continue rendering the fat for another hour or so. Keep a close eye on the fat to make sure that it does not burn. You may want to remove and strain some of the rendered fat as it melts down. Doing so can help the rest of the fat melt down quicker.

      "title": "Remove any remaining chunks.",
      "content": "Remove any remaining chunks. Ladle the rendered fat through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solid pieces, leaving you with nothing but liquid lard. Alternatively, pour the fat through a paper coffee filter wedged inside of a cone or funnel, or through a piece of cheesecloth draped inside a colander. You can pour the lard into a separate bowl or directly into your intended storage containers."
