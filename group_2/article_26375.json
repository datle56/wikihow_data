      "content": "Black is best, but wearing any head-to-toe color looks mature. Wearing monochrome outfits make a stylish statement and shows everyone that you put thought and effort into your look. Black always looks stylish and grownup, but you can try other neutral colors, too. [6] X Research source Neutral colors: black, grey, tan, cream, white, navy, and brown. See what shoe colors you have first since they need to match, too. You probably have mostly black, white, and/or brown, so build your outfit from there."

      "content": "Little kids love wearing shirts with big, bright graphics. Stick with simple clothes, especially shirts, without graphics. Avoid anything with huge logos or cartoon characters on them. Wild prints can also make you look younger. Avoid sports team T-shirts and jerseys when you're trying to look older. [7] X Research source Striped tops are great, just choose subdued, neutral colors. For example, try a white and navy striped T-shirt."

      "content": "Wrinkled and torn clothes can make you look young. See if your parents have a clothing iron or steamer around the house and ask them to show you how to use it. Hang up your clothes when you're done ironing. That way, they'll stay wrinkle-free until you put them on! [8] X Research source It's easy to burn yourself, so be sure to ask your parents for help."

      "content": "If you do wear sneakers, go with brands/styles that teenagers like. For example, sneakers can be cool if you rock a pair of Converse, Jordans, or Vans. Otherwise, stick with a cute pair of flats, loafers, or boots. Shoes with low heels are also good since they make you look taller. [9] X Research source Skip tall heels—they’re too hard to walk in and can look costume-y."

      "content": "Older kids love carrying cool purses and handbags. Stick with simple designs in classic colors like black, cream, or brown. Leather (and faux leather) handbags are always a good choice. [10] X Research source Leather messenger bags are also great—college kids use those a lot."

      "content": "Stick with a nice wristwatch or necklace. Big pieces of jewelry and bright-colored watchbands can look childish, so stick with gold or silver. Leather watchbands are nice, too! Avoid piling on the accessories and go with one simple piece that you really like. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Switching up your hairstyle can give you a whole new vibe. Some styles, like blunt bangs and ponytails, can make you look younger. To look older, opt for a side-swept fringe or use a curling iron to create loose, carefree waves instead of putting your hair up, if your hair is too short add different clips or DIY it. [12] X Research source You can also try looks like: Flat ironing your hair for a smooth, polished look. Wispy, 70s-inspired bangs instead of short, blunt bangs. [13] X Research source Edgy, spiky styles or deep side parts for short hair. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Natural-looking makeup looks more youthful than heavy makeup. For example, darker lashes that contrast a bit with your hair color can make you look slightly older, so try applying a thin coat of brown or black mascara to your top lashes only. [15] X Research source You can also: Curl your lashes if you’re not ready to wear mascara yet (or if your parents won’t allow it). Your lashes will look way longer, which emphasizes your eyes. Skip heavy foundation and use a tinted moisturizer instead. Just spread it all over your face with your fingers like regular lotion! Swipe on a little clear or tinted lip gloss. A pretty rose tint can enhance your features."
