      "content": "Buy or find a pair of tights, leggings, or control-top pantyhose . You can use any tights for this purpose. If you're about the same size at your waist as your chest, you can just purchase your normal size. [2] X Research source Otherwise, use a soft tape measure to measure your chest. Start with 1 end at the front (over the fullest part of your chest) and go around your back until you reach the front with the other end. Pull it slightly tight over your chest and then take the measurement where the end overlaps the rest of the tape measure. [3] X Research source Use this measurement to find the size of tights you need. Check size charts on the back of packages or online when buying your tights."

      "title": "Cut the legs off the tights.",
      "content": "Cut the legs off the tights. Leaving about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of the legs on both sides, use sharp scissors to cut straight across each leg. You should have tights that look like shorts now. [4] X Research source The amount of “leg” you leave on the tights or leggings will become your sleeves later. Longer sleeves will look like a T-shirt or thick-strapped tank, while shorter sleeves will look more like a tank top."

      "title": "Create a hole for your head by cutting open the crotch.",
      "content": "Create a hole for your head by cutting open the crotch. Find the crotch in the tights. Then, smooth the tights out so they look like a flat pair of shorts. Using a pair of scissors, cut a hole out of the crotch that's big enough for your head to fit through. [5] X Research source If the hole isn't big enough for your head to fit through when you try the binder on, use your scissors to open it up more. A wider hole will create a lower and looser neckline, while a small one will make a higher and tighter neckline. Cut whatever feels and looks best to you!"

    {
      "title": "Put the tights on like a small t-shirt.",
      "content": "Put the tights on like a small t-shirt. Stick your head through the hole you made in the crotch and your arms through the “legs” that are left on the tights. Pull the waist part of the tights down over your chest to help flatten it out. [6] X Research source You may want to layer this over a sports bra or fitted compression shirt for a smoother, flatter look. Tights are elastic and breathable, making them a safer DIY binder than other methods. Avoid making binders with t-shirt fabric or other non-stretch fabric as these can be too constrictive and potentially harmful. Remember that this is not a permanent solution!"

      "title": "Layer sports bras without cups for a relatively smooth chest.",
      "content": "Layer sports bras without cups for a relatively smooth chest. Choose sports bras that are flat rather than having cups, as that will help smooth out your chest. If you have a larger chest, layering one on top of the other can help flatten it out. Aim for ones that fit a little tighter, though not so tight that it cuts off your breathing. [7] X Research source Avoid sports bras with a “push up” effect since these will just make your chest more prominent. Consider wearing a second sports bra backwards and letting the elastic band sit on the fullest part of your chest to help flatten it."

      "title": "Wear a camisole with a built-in bra backwards.",
      "content": "Wear a camisole with a built-in bra backwards. Put the camisole on backwards and adjust the straps (now in front) until they’re as short as you can get them. Fold the camisole upward 2 or 3 times so it wraps around your chest, helping flatten it. If needed, you can layer and fold up another camisole on top. [8] X Research source Camisoles are usually available for cheap at most big clothing stores. Purchase one that’s snug and fitted, but not so tight it hurts or constraints your breathing. This method may not work as well for folks with a large chest."

      "title": "Wrap a neoprene back brace around your chest for an easy-to-put-on option.",
      "content": "Wrap a neoprene back brace around your chest for an easy-to-put-on option. These usually attach with Velcro straps. Place the Velcro part under your arm so it doesn't show through your shirt as much, tightening up the brace as needed. It will help flatten out your chest. [9] X Research source You can find these anywhere that sells back braces, such as big box stores and drug stores. Don't make it so tight that you can't breathe. This works best under loose clothing or layers because of the Velcro. Stiff materials like a denim jacket will help disguise bulky binders."

      "title": "Pick up a compression shirt to wear for a simple solution.",
      "content": "Pick up a compression shirt to wear for a simple solution. Compression shirts, like compression leggings or socks, hug the body tightly. When you wear it around your chest, it tends to flatten it out. Then, you can wear whatever you want on top. You can find these in most athletic stores. [10] X Research source If you only have compression shorts available, you can cut them into a shirt by cutting a hole in the crotch that's large enough for your head and wearing the “legs” as sleeves (the waistband area will compress your chest)."

      "content": "Take advantage of layered clothing. If you don’t have any of the garments above, you’re not totally out of luck. Put on a sports bra if you have one, or if not, put on a tight-fitting undershirt (or 2 for more support). Then, layer one or two larger shirts on top—maybe a larger t-shirt and a button-down shirt over it—to dramatically reduce how big your chest looks. [11] X Research source This method isn’t the most effective for folks with large chests, but it’s better than nothing! To make this optical illusion more convincing, try an outer shirt with a crazy or chaotic pattern to distract onlooker’s eyes (using a geometric or repetitive pattern is less distracting).

However, a doctor can help you learn to bind safely and provide instructions for your unique body and needs. For example, if you have any heart, lung, or chest issues, a doctor can help you find a binding solution that doesn’t impact those issues.

Binding 24 hours a day can cause skin problems and other medical issues like overheating, dizziness and headaches, rib fractures and shoulder popping, or breathing issues. You need to leave it off for at least several hours a day to give your body a chance to rest. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When possible, only wear your binder 8 to 10 hours at a time maximum. Remove your binder as soon as possible if you feel any pain, discomfort, or have trouble breathing. Never intentionally wear a binder that is too small or tight to get a flatter look. Mirza warns, “Tight binding can lead to breathing problems and even broken ribs. Over time, compressing your chest in this way can even change your skeletal structure.” [15] X Expert Source Shahpar Mirza Community Transgender Expert Expert Interview. 3 March 2020."

      "content": "Skip the binder when you work out if possible. A sports bra is fine to exercise in since it's designed to move with your body, but makeshift binders like back braces and even tights might be too restrictive. They don't allow you to move enough and you won't be able to breathe as well as you should. [16] X Research source"

If you're having trouble with your binder rubbing your skin and causing redness, a layer of body powder may help, such as baby powder. Just add a light dusting before putting your binder on. [17] X Research source You can also wear a tight undershirt below your binder. Or, use an anti-chafing stick , which goes on like deodorant and protects your skin.

      "content": "Never use tape or Ace bandages to bind your skin. These materials do not move properly, aren’t breathable, and they can cause serious issues with your skin, muscles, and even ribs. Tape can harm your skin by trapping moisture and doesn't bind evenly, while Ace bandages will keep getting tighter as you wear them. This is what they're designed to do for an injury, but that can make breathing difficult. [18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source These types of bindings are more likely to lead to broken ribs. You may see ads for “trans tape” (or kinesiology tape) for binding. This tape only goes on your front and reduces the risk of over-constriction, but the risk for skin irritation and damage remains.

Pro binders aren’t without risks either, but they’re generally safer than DIY solutions that can accidentally be too tight or unbreathable. Mirza reminds us that there are companies that manufacture vest-like binders that go halfway up your torso and compress your chest, as well as longer ones you can tuck in to compress your stomach as well.

Here are some reputable brands to browse when the time is right: [21] X Research source Underworks : A popular, trans-friendly brand with a reputation for good customer service. Gc2b Transitional Apparel : One of the most affordable brands. MyDouble Design : Also makes zip-up binders, but may not have many options for plus-size people. ShapeShifters : Makes adjustable binders to fit your unique measurements. There may also be programs you can apply to for free or reduced-cost binders, like Point of Pride’s chest binder donation program .

There's no need to feel obligated to do so.” [22] X Expert Source Shahpar Mirza Community Transgender Expert Expert Interview. 3 March 2020. Skipping a binder and wearing your natural chest does not take away from your transness or non-binary-ness. In fact, some openly trans and non-binary folks rarely bind or only bind for specific situations. Some don’t bind at all! Always listen to your body and give yourself a break when you feel sore instead of pushing through the pain to maintain a flat appearance."
