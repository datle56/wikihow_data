If there’s any adhesive, such as old tape or sticky tack, pull it off of the wall as well.

Use a sponge, your hand, or another utensil to stir the solution well so it fully combines and gets nice and soapy. Make sure the bucket is clean so you don’t add more dirt to the wall. Use warm water so the mixture combines better. Go with a mild dish soap so there’s no chance of you damaging the paint on the wall."

      "content": "Put sticky tack on the corners of the poster for an affordable option. Sticky putty, or sticky tack, is a cheap adhesive that is strong enough to support the weight of a poster on a painted concrete wall. Take a small pinch of the sticky tack out of the container and apply it to each of the corners of the poster. Then, press each corner of the poster against the wall to hang it up. [3] X Research source You can also apply the sticky tack to just the top 2 corners if you prefer. You can find sticky tack at department stores and online. Popular brands include Blu-Tack and Sticky Tack."

Then, gently press the poster against the surface of the painted concrete wall. Hold the poster in place for about 30 seconds, then carefully release it. The hot glue can be easily washed from the painted concrete wall when you want to take down the poster. Use a laminated poster so it won’t tear whenever you take it off of the wall."
