      "content": "Do planks to strengthen your core muscles. Assume a push-up position with your elbows resting on the floor and your forearms bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep your elbows directly under your shoulders and look straight down toward the floor. Flex your abdominals and hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds at a time (or longer, if you can). [2] X Research source Start by doing 3 to 4 sets of 30-second planks per day and adding 10 to 15 seconds as you notice planking becomes easier. Only your toes, elbows, and forearms should be touching the floor. Your body should make a straight line; avoid letting your back sag down or round up."

Notice that your belly button will go slightly inward toward your spine. Hold this contraction for 5 to 10 seconds before relaxing to make 1 rep. Do about 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps per day. You can feel your transverse abdominis muscles engaging when you say “shhh.” [3] X Research source Do transverse holds while you’re sitting, standing, or lying down."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source When you do a lunge, keep the knee of your forward leg aligned with your ankle. Bend your back knee so it’s aligned with your shoulder and hip. And don’t forget to squeeze your ab muscles inward when you lunge! To perfect your squat form, keep your back neutral (not arched), lift your chest, and pull your belly in toward your spine for the entire squat."

      "content": "Find a physical therapist to safely tone your core if you have diastasis recti. Diastasis recti occurs when your front abdominal muscles abnormally split due to overstretching during pregnancy. Perform a self-check for diastasis recti by lying on your back and lifting your head up to look at your abdomen. If you see a gap between the two bands of your abdominal muscles, you have diastasis recti. Ask your doctor if they can recommend a certain physical therapist or find a licensed physical therapist near you at http://www.apta.org/ . [6] X Research source A physical therapist can lead you through different core exercises to strengthen your abdominal muscles while correcting the gap in your muscles. Avoid doing crunches if you have diastasis recti because it can make the abdominal separation worse! You’re more likely to get diastasis recti if you’ve been pregnant more than once. Don’t worry, diastasis recti isn’t a serious condition, but it can increase your risk of urinary incontinence and pelvic floor disorders later on in life."
