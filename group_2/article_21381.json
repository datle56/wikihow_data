You could do a single french braid down the center of your scalp, pigtail braids, or a chic side braid. [2] X Research source This look works best for medium to long hair, though you could still create braids with short hair! You may just have to modify the look a little bit."

      "content": "Pull your hair back in a ponytail or bun to relax your perm as it grows. This style is an excellent way to hide the fact that your hair is growing out while also encouraging your perm to relax. For a more professional look, try creating a low bun at the nape of your neck. For a more stylized look, do a high ponytail or bun. [3] X Research source To make your ponytail look more stylized, leave out a few strands of hair around your face. Keeping your hair out of ponytails and buns is standard advice when you first get a perm because it can change the look of your curls, but once you’re growing out your hair, it can be a helpful styling method."

      "content": "Keep the texture of your hair consistent with a curling iron or wand. As your perm grows, your hair’s ends may still be curly while your roots turn straight or limp. If you’re wearing your hair down, curl a few sections of hair on the sides and back to add volume and make it less noticeable that your hair is growing out. You may not be able to replicate the exact style of curl as your perm, but adding some curls and waves throughout your hair will help create a more cohesive style. You could curl your entire head of hair, though just doing 7-8 small sections should add enough texture and volume to give you a great look."

      "content": "Use bobby pins and clips to style short hair while it’s growing out. These styling tools can be particularly helpful for growing out a permed pixie cut or shaggy bob. As your hair gets longer, it might hit an awkward length and be curly at the ends and more limp toward your roots. Try out some of these bobby-pin styles: Make a small twist with the hair on either side of your head and pin them back behind your ears. French braid your hair on either side if it’s long enough. Use bobby pins to tuck away stray strands of hair. Put your hair back in a small, low ponytail and use clips to pin back any hairs that were too short to reach the elastic."

      "content": "Style your hair with a blowdryer to create the same texture throughout your locks. If you’re in the middle of growing out a perm, the hair near your roots may be relaxed while the ends of your hair might still have a lot of curl. Use a big, round brush to blow-dry your hair and smooth out the ends so that there isn’t such a big difference between the top and bottom sections. You could even use a straightener to smooth out your hair from root to tip. Remember, heat can damage your already-sensitive hair. Use a lower heat setting when you can, and try not to style your hair with heat every day."

Heated styling tools are typically frowned upon when your hair is permed, but if you’re trying to grow out a perm, they can help style your hair while also encouraging the perm to relax a bit faster. You can straighten your hair, make beach waves, or create big curls with permed hair. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that using heated styling tools can add more damage to your hair, so you’ll want to be careful and not use them every day. Use a heat protectant spray or cream on your hair before using hot styling tools."

If you like the length of your hair and don’t want to chop it all off to get rid of your perm, practice patience and cut off just a bit every month. This way, you’ll progressively cut off your permed hair without sacrificing length. Generally, hair grows about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) every month, so you could consistently trim off that much without losing much, if any, length."

If you don’t want to lose length but are worried about how your perm looks as it grows out, lean into the natural look that layers will provide. Some strands of your hair will be straighter than others, but this can create a lovely texture that looks styled and effortless at the same time. [5] X Research source This look works best if your hair has a little bit of natural wave to it. Use curling products, like mousse or spray, to amplify the natural wave that your hair already and to add even more volume."

By removing the permed ends of your hair, you’re left with locks that are half-permed and half-natural. The curl on the ends of the bob should help create beautiful waves and give you hair some texture and volume. Depending on how long you want to leave your hair, have the ends land anywhere between your chin and shoulder."

The healthier your hair, the faster it will grow, and using the right kind of products can keep your locks in the best condition possible.

Ask your hairstylist for a product recommendation if you aren’t sure what to get. You can always search for a similar product online or at your local box store for a less expensive option. Since chemically-treated hair tends to be dry, be sure you're drinking plenty of water to keep your scalp and hair hydrated. Also, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and deep condition your hair every 1-2 weeks. [8] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019."

[9] X Research source Look for curl-defining creams, gels, and mousses. Check out anti-frizz serums to help tame flyaways. To help encourage your hair to grow faster, blend a few drops of essential oils like rosemary or black seed oil into a carrier like olive or almond oil.

Gently brush your hair starting at the ends and moving up to your roots with a wide-toothed comb before moving on to any other types of brushes. [12] X Research source Detangling your hair in the shower is a smart step when you have a perm. Apply your conditioner and then carefully brush through your locks with a wide-toothed comb. The conditioner will be more evenly dispersed, and you’ll have fewer tangles to contend with later."

Protecting your locks while you sleep will make both of those things more manageable. The silk creates a barrier between your hair and your pillow, meaning your hair will encounter less friction and be less frizzy in the morning. [13] X Research source You could also swap out your regular pillowcases for silk ones instead of wrapping your hair in a silk scarf."
