Use a fork to mash the lemons a little so they release some of their juices. The active ingredient in citrus fruits that deters and kills fleas is found in the rinds, and juicing the fruit with a fork will also help to break up the rinds."

      "content": "Launder everything you can. Fleas, eggs, and larvae can be found all over your house, and one of the best ways to get rid of them is by washing everything. This includes linens and bedding, towels, drapes, clothes, toys, and pet beds and mats. Run them through the washing machine using hot water and dry in a dryer. When you dry the loads, use the highest temperature settings to ensure you kill everything. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray the furniture.",
      "content": "Spray the furniture. After washing and vacuuming, spray your entire house with your homemade lemon flea spray. Pay particular attention to furniture, drapes, and areas where your pet spends time. For the first week, spray the house in the morning and in the evening. Once the fleas are gone, continue spraying the house every few days to deter them from coming back. Be thoughtful in deciding where and how much of the lemon flea spray to use, because components of lemon rind can be toxic to animals if ingested. Limit or avoid spraying areas and especially items that your pet might lick or chew. Lemon juice is often used as a stain-removing ingredient, but it’s best to test the spray on an inconspicuous area of furniture and drapes to test for color-fastness. If the area isn't discolored by the lemon juice, spray the mixture liberally."

      "content": "Comb the flea spray through your pet’s fur. For this task you'll need a flea comb, a bucket of soapy water, and your flea spray. When possible, comb your pet with the flea comb outside so that eggs and larvae don’t fall off inside. Spray a small patch of fur near the head and ears with the flea spray. Use the flea comb to comb through that section of fur, working in the spray and picking up fleas as you go. Swirl the comb around in the soapy water any time you pull off fleas in the comb. [7] X Research source Work your way from the head to the tail, spraying and combing in small sections as you go. When you get to the tail, repeat the spraying and combing. Hose down the area when you're finished to kill any fleas that jumped away. If you combed inside, vacuum the area thoroughly. Repeat these steps daily until there are no fleas left."

After you comb the flea spray through your pet’s fur every day, shampoo and rinse your pet to wash away excess lemon spray. Limonene can cause liver damage in animals, but it’s only found in the rind of citrus fruits.
