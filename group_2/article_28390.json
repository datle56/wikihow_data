Look for shampoos and conditioners that have lots of vitamins and minerals in them, giving your hair refreshing nutrients that will help smooth it out. These are usually marketed as smoothing, sleek, or straightening products. Look for ingredients such as wheat proteins, pro vitamin B5, or hedera helix extract. Take the time to comb the conditioner into your hair while in the shower, using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb. This can get rid of tangles and encourage straightness."

Use even smaller sections if you have thick or coarse hair. Go for chunks that are about 0.5–1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) wide."
