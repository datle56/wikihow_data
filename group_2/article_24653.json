Asking about their dreams, fears, values, and childhood is the best way to increase intimacy in a friendship or romantic relationship. If the other person doesn’t feel comfortable, Bilotta says to “respect their boundaries and move on to the next question.” Who’s your hero? What’s your biggest fear? Are you close with your family? When’s the last time you cried? What are you most grateful for? What are you the most proud of? What’s your biggest regret so far? Do you believe in fate or free will? Do you care what people think of you? Where do you see yourself in 5 years? What’s your favorite childhood memory? Do you think money can buy happiness? What’s something you’re insecure about?
