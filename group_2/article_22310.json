Physical activity increases the amount of serotonin in the brain, which acts like a natural antidepressant and improves your mood. You'll also have more energy and feel better about yourself in general. [1] X Research source Take some group fitness classes or hit the gym with a buddy.

      "content": "Find things to laugh about. Laughter really is one of life's best medicines! Take some time to engage in activities that make you laugh. Watch films that you find hilarious, revisit some funny memes you’ve seen on social media, call up one of your humorous friends for a chat, or go see a stand-up comedian perform at a local club. Try to avoid funny things that will remind you of your ex at first. Skip the film if it was one of your faves as a couple, for example."

Enjoy your new freedom and independence! Take this time to do all of the fun things that your partner never wanted or enjoyed doing with you. For instance, perhaps your partner never wanted to try Indian food. This is a perfect time for you to do so. Consider linking up with other people who also want to try new things. For example, you could join a special interest group on Meetup.com."

Take some time to think about all of the good qualities that you possess. Write them down and remind yourself of them daily. Strengths can include humor, intellect, beauty, persistence, diligence, or compassion. You might consider writing them on sticky notes and putting them in certain places in your room or house.

      "content": "Try to manage your other responsibilities the best you can. It's okay to take some time to grieve during this sad time, but don't forget about your other responsibilities. Continue to work hard at your career or in school. Stay connected and in touch with family and friends so that you don’t lose those crucial support systems. Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and avoid negative coping mechanisms like excessive drinking. For example, keep up with your bills and stay on top of cleaning tasks. Make yourself a healthy dinner each night. Even completing a small task can help you feel like you are making progress and moving on with your life."

Try planning a movie night, going to the zoo, hitting the beach, or trying a new restaurant. Remember the fun you used to have with them and try to recapture that part of your life.

      "content": "Adopt a pet for comfort and companionship. If you have the time and resources, caring for a pet can be a rewarding and healing experience. Consider adopting a cat or dog from your local shelter. That way, you'll gain a new friend and also save the life of an animal that deserves a forever home. If you rent rather than own your living space, make sure you're allowed to have a pet by checking with your landlord first. Having a pet can also help you connect with other pet owners. For example, if you walk your dog at the park, you can chat with other dog owners. If you already have a pet, spend more time with them. Bring home a new toy or a special treat and just enjoy their company."

You'll meet interesting new people and it may help you to move on. However, don't feel pressured to date if you aren't emotionally ready! Take your time. [4] X Research source Once you do start dating, you don't have to get serious with someone else right away. Move at a comfortable pace and try to avoid rebound relationships. If you've spent very little time in your past being single, or if you seem to have relationships one after the other without a break in between, you may need to watch out for rebounding.

      "content": "Cut off all contact with them. One of the most important steps to moving past your breakup is cutting off all communication with your ex. Do not call, text or email them. If they reach out to you, don't reply. You can even consider blocking them if you feel tempted to respond. Give yourself a minimum of 90 days while you detach emotionally from them. [6] X Research source If you have children or assets together, this won't be possible. Try to limit your interactions to only those that are absolutely necessary. If you don't have any reason (like children) to speak after 90 days, consider a full break from that person with no communication. Otherwise, you may prolong your pain and have a hard time moving on. If you feel like reaching out to them, write them an email but don’t send it. Putting your feelings into words can be cathartic."

You may want to make the social media disconnection permanent, since there's no reason to remind yourself of them in the future. Consider cleansing their pictures from your own social media profiles, too. You don't have to delete the images forever! Just remove them from your accounts so you don't have to see them constantly. You may also want to unfollow their friends for now, so you don’t run the risk of seeing a picture or post about your ex."

Set aside private time every day to think about the breakup. Don’t hold in your tears; let them flow, freeing you of some of the sadness you're carrying. Every day, devote less and less time to grieving. You'll eventually find yourself thinking about the breakup less often.

      "content": "Cleanse your space of reminders of your ex. Remove all the memories of the person from your everyday life. The goal isn't to pretend like the person never existed, but simply to remove reminders which are currently painful for you. Collect all pictures, letters, and references to your ex and pack them away. Removing is different from destroying. Don't burn or destroy any objects associated with the person, unless you're sure you'll never want to look at them again."
