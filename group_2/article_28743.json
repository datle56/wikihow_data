Alternatively, sort the drawers so that things you use most often are at arm level, easiest to reach, and things that are less frequently used are lower or higher. Slide the drawers into the compartments. Use compartments without the drawers for larger objects. Use small containers to store small objects. These are tennis ball cans. Check with your local tennis club - you might get hundreds of them for free."
