      "content": "Gather ingredients. For this recipe you will need a variety of liqueurs: orange, pineapple, and amaretto almond. You also want to grab some unflavored vodka and a small amount of pineapple juice that you can splash in at the end. You need a half shot, or 3/4 of an ounce (22 ml), of each. The original liquid cocaine shot was also very fruity, containing these ingredients: triple sec, amaretto almond liqueur, peach liqueur, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, cranberry juice, and lemon-lime soda."

      "content": "Chill the ingredients. For a sweet yet potent treat, chill the ingredients for the fruity liquid cocaine shot in the refrigerator before mixing them in your cocktail shaker. Alternatively, you can place room temperature ingredients in the shaker, allowing the ice you add later to chill them."

      "content": "Put the lid on and shake. Place the lid on the cocktail shaker and shake the mixture until it is well chilled. Shaking the mixture in a cocktail shaker is recommended for both sufficiently mixing the ingredients and chilling them. If you don't have a cocktail shaker, you can mix the ingredients in a blender and pour over ice, or mix them by hand with a spoon or whisk and pour over ice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strain it.",
      "content": "Strain it. Pour the mixture through a strainer to remove the ice. It works best to strain the drink right from the cocktail mixer into your shot glasses. You can purchase a cocktail strainer that is specially designed, or get a cocktail shaker with a built-in strainer. In a pinch, you can just use a normal kitchen strainer, although it might get messy. If you chilled the mixture in the fridge without ice, skip the strainer and pour directly into the shot glasses."

You only need a half ounce, or 15 ml, of each liquor to make this recipe for two shots. Typically this version of the shot is not chilled. However, if you want it cold, fill the cocktail shaker halfway with ice. For the pure grain alcohol, a popular and easy-to-find brand is Everclear®. Most variations of the liquid cocaine shot include Jagermeister or a flavored schnapps, making this \"hard\" version unique. This shot is VERY potent. DO NOT drive home if you drink this shot!"

If you don't want to chill this shot, skip the cocktail shaker and pour each ½ ounce directly into the shot glass. You really do want to drink this shot all at once. This is a very strong shot, so taking your time makes it progressively more difficult to swallow (unless you are accustomed to drinking these types of liquor)."

This version of the liquid cocaine shot is made from only two ingredients: cinnamon schnapps and Jagermeister, and you need one shot of each to make this liquid cocaine shot for two. Jaegermeister is an herbal German liqueur made of 56 different herbal sources, such as blooms, roots, fruit, and herbs. The recipe is secret. [1] X Research source The thick, sweet liqueurs mix to produce a strong-flavored cocktail shot. A popular brand of cinnamon schnapps is Goldschläger, found in most liquor stores. Another common version of the liquid cocaine shot is to mix the recipe in this method with a half shot of peppermint schnapps. [2] X Research source"
