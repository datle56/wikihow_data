The lead leg is the leg that goes over the hurdle extended before your body. [3] X Research source The lead leg is usually the leg that people use to catch themselves while falling. People can trip forward or have someone push them to find which leg makes sense for them. Many people also switch back and forth between legs which is a possibility."

      "content": "Count your steps. The number of steps you take will depend on how long the course is, as well as on the person's height, weight, speed, the height of their jump, the length of the jump, and even their usual sprinting stride length. You might take 4-5 steps before the first hurdle on a 60m course and 6-8 on a 100m course. Steps in between will be different for every person. One thing to note, however, is that if the hurdles are evenly spaced, you should have the same amount of steps in between every hurdle. You should not take three huge steps and then eight little steps... Instead maybe take 6 regular stride steps. Picture yourself going barely an inch over the jump. You might find that when you try to get as low as possible, you end up clearing the jump by plenty, while increasing your speed. Practice really does make perfect! And leaning forward opens a whole new world of speed."
