      "title": "Buy some soft and stretchy knee-high or calf-length socks.",
      "content": "Buy some soft and stretchy knee-high or calf-length socks. The size of the sock you’ll need will depend on the size of the kitten, but women’s calf-length or knee-high socks are usually a safe bet. Look for some socks that are soft and have a bit of stretch so that they’ll fit comfortably around your kitten’s body. [1] X Research source While your kitten probably won’t care what its onesie looks like, there are lots of cute, colorful socks available if you want something fun and fashionable! For really tiny kittens, you might go for a shorter crew sock or a child-sized sock. If you’re worried about keeping your kitten warm, choose some fuzzy microfiber socks. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the sock flat with the heel facing up.",
      "content": "Lay the sock flat with the heel facing up. Once you’ve picked the perfect sock, flatten it out widthwise. The heel should now be facing up, with the fold or pleat of the sock running along the top and bottom. [3] X Research source The heel will be where your kitten’s chest rests, while its rear will be at the toe end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the toe end of the sock in half at the pleat.",
      "content": "Fold the toe end of the sock in half at the pleat. With the sock still lying heel-up, fold the toe end in half down the middle along the sock’s natural fold. Pinch the 2 halves of the toe end together so that they are facing up (toward you). [4] X Research source This is where you’ll be cutting the holes for the kitten’s back legs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut a half-circle out of the edge of the folded material.",
      "content": "Cut a half-circle out of the edge of the folded material. Just behind the toe end of the sock, along the edges that you have pinched together, cut a half-circle that is no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) across. Make sure to cut through both layers of fabric. When you unfold the sock, you should have 2 identical holes close to the toe end. [5] X Research source If the holes are too small, you can always enlarge them later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim off the toe end of the sock.",
      "content": "Trim off the toe end of the sock. Once you’ve cut the rear leg holes, cut off the toe of the sock. You can use the seam where the toe is sewn on as a guide for where to make the cut. [6] X Research source You’ll want to leave a little bit of space (e.g., about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm)) between the cut across the toe and the rear leg holes. This cut will leave a hole for your kitten’s tail to poke through, and will also allow it to use the litterbox while wearing its onesie."

    {
      "title": "Measure the distance between the kitten’s front and back legs.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between the kitten’s front and back legs. You don’t have to break out the tape measure to do this—just try to get a good estimate of how far the kitten’s hips are from its shoulders. Measure the same distance from the rear leg holes on the sock to a point on or near the heel of the sock. [7] X Research source You should be able to estimate the distance with your fingers. For example, line up your thumb with the kitten’s back leg and your pinky with its front leg, then put your fingers on the sock in the same position."

    {
      "title": "Make another half-circle cut near the heel.",
      "content": "Make another half-circle cut near the heel. Once you’ve figured out where to make the cut for the front legs, lay the sock out flat again with the heel facing up. Push the heel inward to create an indentation in the middle, then fold the edges up just like you did with the toe. Cut another 1 in (2.5 cm) half-circle through the edges of the fabric. [8] X Research source When you unfold the sock again, you should have 2 identical holes on either side of the heel."

    {
      "title": "Cut off the top of the sock about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the leg holes.",
      "content": "Cut off the top of the sock about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the leg holes. This last cut will create the neck of the onesie. Measure roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the front leg holes, then cut straight across the leg of the sock. [9] X Research source This will leave some extra material that you can roll over like a turtleneck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the onesie on your kitten starting at the head end.",
      "content": "Put the onesie on your kitten starting at the head end. When you’re ready to put the onesie on your kitten, stretch it open and squeeze it into a ring or donut shape. Pull it over your kitten’s head, then pull it down over its chest and slip its front legs through the leg holes at the heel. Next, pull the back legs through the back leg holes near the toe end. [10] X Research source As your kitten moves about in its onesie, check occasionally to make sure it seems to be fitting comfortably. Trim off any frayed ends that appear, and wash the onesie it if it gets wet or soiled."

      "title": "Get a large sock with plenty of stretch.",
      "content": "Get a large sock with plenty of stretch. You may not be able to fit an adult cat or a mostly grown kitten into a sock onesie, but some smaller adult kitties can still fit into a sock sweater without the rear leg holes. Look for a large sock (such as a large men’s crew or calf sock) that’s soft and stretchy. [11] X Research source It may help to use an old sock that’s already a bit stretched out. A sock sweater can help protect wounds or stitches on the upper body, or it can simply help keep your cat warm. You can also make kitten-sized sock sweaters for younger cats that need a little extra warmth. Just choose a smaller sock, such as a women’s or child’s sock."

    {
      "title": "Cut off the toe end of the sock.",
      "content": "Cut off the toe end of the sock. Your cat’s back legs and rear end will stick out of the toe end of the sock. Cut straight across the sock just behind the toe. [12] X Research source You can cut closer or farther from the toe depending on how long you want the body of the sweater to be."

    {
      "title": "Fold the heel in half and cut out a half circle for the front legs.",
      "content": "Fold the heel in half and cut out a half circle for the front legs. Fold the heel of the sock inward at the middle and pinch the edges of the fabric together on either side of the fold. Then, take your scissors and cut a half-circle through both edges of the cloth in the middle of the heel. Make the half circle about 1 inch (2.5 cm) across. [13] X Research source If you like, you can use a marker to draw the half circle on before you make the cut for extra guidance. When you unfold the heel, you should see 2 identical holes on either side. If you find that the holes are too small for your cat’s legs, you can always cut them a little larger."

      "title": "Trim off the leg of the sock to make the neck.",
      "content": "Trim off the leg of the sock to make the neck. Once you’ve made the front leg holes, make another cut straight across the leg end of the sock. [14] X Research source Try to leave a little extra material in front of the leg holes (e.g., about 3 inches (7.6 cm)) so that you can roll it over to make a turtleneck."

      "title": "Slip the sock sweater over your cat’s head.",
      "content": "Slip the sock sweater over your cat’s head. When you’re ready to put the sweater on your cat, gather it into a donut or ring shape and stretch it out. Quickly but gently pull the sweater over the cat’s head, making sure the toe end is facing back, then pull it down and ease the cat’s front legs through the arm holes. Pull the rest of the sock down to cover your cat’s chest and upper body. [15] X Research source This will probably be easiest if you approach your cat from behind. You could also ask someone else to help you by holding the cat while you put the sweater on. Pet and soothe your cat as you’re putting the sweater on. You can also reward it with a treat once it’s over."
