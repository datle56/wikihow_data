      "content": "If you’ve never built a PC before (or replaced a cooler), you might get overwhelmed by all the terminology. If you find yourself getting mixed up, just pop back up here. These are all the components and terms you need to know: CPU: Short for central processing unit, the CPU is the brain of your PC. It generates enough heat that it needs dedicated cooling. Without a cooler, the CPU will overheat and die. Cooler: “Cooler” is just a general term for the component that keeps your CPU cool. There are two types of coolers: Air Cooler: Air coolers have fans that go on top of the CPU. The heat transfers to the fan block and air blows it out of the case (usually through the back). All in One Cooler (AIO): AIOs have radiators and liquid cooling lines filled with coolant. The coolant carries the heat to the radiator, away from the CPU, and blows it out of the case (usually through the top or the front). Heatsink: This is the metal block that sits right on the CPU and absorbs the heat. Socket: The socket refers to the container that holds the CPU on the motherboard. AM4/AM5: AM4 and AM5 are different socket types. An AM5 motherboard cannot hold chips meant for AM4 sockets and vice versa. AM5 is the newest socket. Thermal Paste: Thermal paste is the glue-like substance that transfers heat from the CPU to the cooler. You either must apply the paste yourself, or use a cooler with the paste pre-applied."

      "content": "Static discharges can fry your PC components if you aren’t careful. Oppido recommends using an anti-static grounding wristband or footstrap. On top of that, he says to stay off of carpet, take your socks off, and regularly touch unpainted metal surfaces to discharge whatever static has built up in your body. Oppido says, “Don't lift your feet while you're working on the machine. Don’t shuffle your feet or move unnecessarily. As soon as I start building a PC, I get myself in a spot and I consciously think about not lifting my feet. This will keep any static away from your PC.” When do you install the cooler? If you have an air cooler, do it after installing your CPU but before you install the motherboard in the case. For an AIO, do it after the motherboard is in the case but before you install the fans."

      "content": "If your CPU isn’t installed in the motherboard, do that now. Oppido emphasizes not touching the golden pins on the CPU. If those get bent, your CPU won’t work. Open the socket by raising the little metal arm on the side and lift the metal cover. Holding the rim of the CPU, position it in the socket so the triangle in the corner of the CPU points at the triangle on the motherboard. Lower the metal cover and metal arm to lock the CPU in place. [1] X Research source Warning: You do not need to apply any pressure here. Just gently lower the CPU into the socket. If you have an older AM4 motherboard, there won’t be any cover. You just use the little lever on its own."

      "content": "Read your cooler’s instruction manual to see what you need to do. Every cooler is different, but the process is typically pretty similar. [2] X Research source Here are the key points: Unscrew the brackets on the motherboard (if there are any). The rubber brackets are normally to protect the CPU socket when the motherboard is in the box. You may need to remove a special bracket designed for Intel CPUs if one is preinstalled. Determine the orientation of the cooler. For air coolers, make sure the fans are pointing to the vent on the case you want the hot air to blow out of. For AIOs, make sure your liquid lines feed out of the cooler head in the right direction and that the power cable has clearance. Confirm you have case clearance for the radiator (AIO only). After you ensure the cooler is oriented correctly, check the radiator location. Ensure the radiator fits in the side of the machine where you’re placing it. A key note on radiators: You must orient the AIO radiator at the top or front of the machine so that the liquid loop begins higher than your CPU. If the liquid lines go below the CPU, air bubbles will appear in the coolant lines. As Oppido puts it, “Air bubbles are one of the worst conductors you could possibly have and they will destroy your CPU.” Remove any plastic covering on the cooler. Your cooler likely has a plastic sheet protecting the pad where it sits on the CPU. Take this off before installing the cooler."

      "title": "Confirm your cooler doesn’t have the paste pre-applied, first.",
      "content": "Confirm your cooler doesn’t have the paste pre-applied, first. Skip this step if the cooler has thermal paste pre-applied on it. Oppido explains, “Thermal paste transfers heat from the chip to the heatsink. If you need to apply it, put a single grain of rice’s worth of paste in the center of the heatsink. You don’t need a lot. If you use too much, it’s just going to create air pockets and make it harder for heat to transfer to the heatsink.” You don’t need to spread the paste out on the CPU. The pressure from the cooler will spread it out evenly. However, if you do want to spread the paste out (as many PC builders do), use the applicator that came with the paste."

      "title": "With the thermal paste applied, set the heatsink over the CPU.",
      "content": "With the thermal paste applied, set the heatsink over the CPU. Before you drop the cooler in place, confirm that your cooler is pointing in the right direction and that everything is lined up as you originally intended. Then, gently lower the cooler in place. You do not need to apply any pressure to the cooler or push it into position. [3] X Research source Ensure that the screw slots on the motherboard line up with the screw slots on the cooler. The older AM4 stock AMD coolers have clips on the edges that hook to the motherboard. Connect those before you install the screws."

      "title": "Do not tighten the screws all the way—just get them threaded in.",
      "content": "Do not tighten the screws all the way—just get them threaded in. Without touching or moving the CPU cooler, gently lower the screws into the motherboard screw slots. Twist each screw just far enough to get it to catch on the threading of the motherboard. Do not tighten the screws all the way. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Alternate between the screws to slowly tighten them in phases.",
      "content": "Alternate between the screws to slowly tighten them in phases. Pick a screw, tighten it one turn, and then tighten the screw on the opposite side (diagonally) by one turn. Tighten an adjacent screw and repeat the process. Keep tightening the screws in alternating phases until the cooler is completely secure and fully installed. [5] X Research source Why do I have to tighten the screws in phases? This ensures that the pressure is applied evenly on the CPU, which prevents heat from building up on one specific portion of the CPU (which is especially bad for the chip). How tight do the screws have to be? Apply enough force that your heatsink won’t move at all, but don’t apply so much force that the screws might snap. Picture how tightly you’d install a screw to hang a large painting—that’s kind of what you’re going for."

      "content": "If you have an AIO, install it in the case after your heatsink is secure. You don’t need to install the radiator using the same screw strategy as the heatsink—just line the radiator up with the screw slots in the case and install the radiator. [6] X Research source What about the radiator fans? You can totally install those now if you’d like, but we prefer to leave the fans for last. They can kind of get in the way while you install the other components. Depending on your case clearance, you may need to install the fans on the radiator first before you install the radiator."

      "content": "Find a CPU fan header and plug in the cooler. Read your motherboard’s manual if you’re lost here—it will have a full diagram of all the headers and slots. Locate a CPU fan header and connect the AIO/air cooler cable to ensure the cooler has power. Your cooler is now fully installed! The CPU fan headers are often labeled “CPU Fan.” They’re usually color-coded white, although that can change based on the aesthetics of your motherboard model. If your AIO has any RGB features, hook them up. Use any RGB header to hook up the RGB cable. Don’t worry about mixing up the RGB header and CPU header—they’re shaped differently and can’t be connected to the wrong header."

You can also install the PSU next if you haven’t run any of the cabling yet. If you have an AIO, ideally you just have fans left to do. Regardless of whatever you have left, complete the rest of the PC build."
