      "title": "Chop 2 cups of lemongrass stalks or leaves.",
      "content": "Chop 2 cups of lemongrass stalks or leaves. Hit the stalks with the flat side of your knife blade to bruise them. This will release the fragrant oil inside of the tough stalks. Then, carefully give the lemongrass a rough chop. The pieces should be about 1 ⁄ 2 –1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) long. If you're using home-grown lemongrass, you can use the leaves to make the tea. There’s no need to bruise the leaves, though. Chop the lemongrass on a cutting board so you don't dull your knife blade or damage your countertop! Since lemongrass is often sold already cut if you buy it at a grocery store, the number of stalks you'll need will vary."

      "content": "Bring 4 cups (950 mL) of water to a boil over high heat. Pour your water into a medium-sized saucepan or another similar pot so the water doesn’t boil over once it heats up. Then, place it on the stove on high heat for a few minutes until it reaches a boil. [1] X Research source Be careful as the water heats up. The pot will become very hot!"

      "title": "Add the lemongrass and continue boiling the water for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Add the lemongrass and continue boiling the water for 5 minutes. Once the water reaches a rapid, rolling boil, it’s time to add the lemongrass. Carefully drop the chopped lemongrass directly into the boiling water. If you need to, give it a stir with a long-handled spoon to ensure the lemongrass is completely submerged, then let it steep in the boiling water for about 5 minutes. [2] X Research source A rapid boil means if you stir the water, it shouldn't stop bubbling. Hold the lemongrass close to the surface of the water when you drop it in. This will reduce the chances that it will splash back onto you. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the mixture through a strainer to remove the stalks.",
      "content": "Pour the mixture through a strainer to remove the stalks. After the tea has finished steeping, it’s best to strain it so you don’t accidentally end up drinking any fibers from the lemongrass. Pour the tea through a fine mesh strainer or colander into a pitcher or another container. [4] X Research source While lemongrass is perfectly edible, the fibers from the stalks might be an unpleasant addition to a soothing cup of tea. If you like, you can strain the tea directly into your teacup."

      "title": "Serve right away if you prefer warm tea.",
      "content": "Serve right away if you prefer warm tea. A warm cup of lemongrass tea is soothing and delicious in the morning or on a cool day. Once you’ve strained it, you can enjoy the tea as soon as it’s cool enough to drink! [5] X Research source Sweeten the tea in your cup with a little honey or sugar, if you like."

      "title": "Chill the mixture to make iced tea.",
      "content": "Chill the mixture to make iced tea. If you prefer iced tea, place your pitcher of lemongrass tea into the refrigerator for an hour or so. This will create a refreshing, citrusy herbal tea that’s perfect on a hot day or served with your meals. [6] X Research source To make sweetened iced tea, stir in 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar before you place the tea in the refrigerator. For the best results, serve the chilled tea over ice."

      "title": "Stir in a splash of milk if you like a creamy tea.",
      "content": "Stir in a splash of milk if you like a creamy tea. If you like milk in your tea, you’ll probably enjoy it in lemongrass tea as well. This traditional tea addition will cool off a cup of hot tea, and it adds a creamy mouthfeel to this herbal treat. The amount you use depends on how much you like, but it’s best to start with about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) and work from there. [7] X Research source If you like, you can use heavy cream or half-and-half instead."

      "title": "Add 1 tsp (7 g) of honey for a sweeter tea.",
      "content": "Add 1 tsp (7 g) of honey for a sweeter tea. The rich sweetness of honey perfectly complements lemongrass. Measure out 1 tsp (7 g) of your favorite honey, then stir it in until it’s completely dissolved. If you still want your tea to be sweeter, add another tsp (7 g) of honey."

    {
      "title": "Steep the tea with ginger for a little spice.",
      "content": "Steep the tea with ginger for a little spice. If you want to use fresh ginger root in your tea, slice off a piece that’s about 1 in (2.5 cm) long scrape off the peel. Then, drop it into the water while you’re boiling the lemongrass. [8] X Research source A tea made from ginger and lemongrass will be spicy, tangy, and comforting, and it’s especially soothing if you have a sore throat or a head cold."

      "title": "Squeeze in a little lime to enhance the tangy flavor.",
      "content": "Squeeze in a little lime to enhance the tangy flavor. Lemongrass has a natural citrus flavor, but it’s a little more mellow than using actual lemons or limes. If you want to amp up the citrus taste, squeeze a wedge of lime over your tea. Start with about 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) of lime juice, then add more if you want. [9] X Research source The lime will provide more of a contrast to the lemongrass than a lemon, which might mask the subtle flavor of the lemongrass."
