      "title": "Choose a tube-shaped wreath to use as a base.",
      "content": "Choose a tube-shaped wreath to use as a base. You can use a straw wreath or a Styrofoam wreath, but it needs to be tube-shaped with no sharp edges. Choose a wreath a few inches/centimeters smaller than you want it to be. The tied-on ribbons will make it appear larger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your ribbons.",
      "content": "Choose your ribbons. You will need a 1½ to 2-inch (3.81 to 5.08-centimeter) wide, solid-colored ribbon to use as a base. You will also need a variety of other ribbons to use as the ties. They can be solid colored, patterned, sheer, or a combination of the three. Make sure that the colors and patterns go well together. 7/8, 5/8, and 3/8-inch (22, 16, and 10-millimeter) wide ribbons will work the best for the ties."

      "title": "Wrap a wide, solid-colored ribbon around the wreath to cover it.",
      "content": "Wrap a wide, solid-colored ribbon around the wreath to cover it. Hot glue the end of the ribbon to your wreath. Wrap the ribbon around the wreath in a spiral, making sure to overlap it slightly. When you are back to where you started, cut the excess ribbon off, and hot glue the end down. You won't see much of this layer in the end, but it will look nicer peaking through your tied ribbons than bare Styrofoam or straw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the rest of the ribbon into shorter pieces.",
      "content": "Cut the rest of the ribbon into shorter pieces. Each of these pieces need to be long enough to wrap around the wreath, plus a couple of inches/centimeters) for the tails. How long you cut the ribbons depends on how thick the wreath is and how long you want the ties to be. For more texture, cut V-shaped notches into the ends of the ribbons."

      "title": "Tie the short ribbons around the wreath.",
      "content": "Tie the short ribbons around the wreath. Take a ribbon, thread it into the wreath, then tie both ends into double-knot on the outside edge. Repeat this step over and over until the entire wreath is filled. Alternate different colors and patterns of ribbon for a unique effect. Begin tying on the right side of the hanging ribbon, and finish tying on the left side."

      "title": "Fluff the wreath out.",
      "content": "Fluff the wreath out. Adjust the short, tied ribbons so that the knots are all on the outside of the wreath and even. If you were to look at your wreath from the side, the knots should all be in a straight line, not a wavy one. Lastly, gently pull the tied ends of each ribbon apart to make them appear fuller."

Choose a mixture of solid colors and patterns, but make sure that they all go together. For a really interesting wreath, you can even combine satin, grosgrain, and sheer ribbon.

[4] X Research source Use the 7/8-inch (22-millimeter) ribbons on the second ring. Use the 5/8-inch (16-millimeter) ribbons on the third ring.

For a winter wreath, try ornaments, jingle bells, or plastic snowflakes. For a spring wreath, try plastic Easter eggs, butterflies, or spring flowers. For a summer wreath, try bees, butterflies, or daisies/sunflowers."
