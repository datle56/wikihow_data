      "content": "The common opal creates a soft glow. Opals can be classified into two major categories: common and precious. Precious opals are known for producing a special, iridescent color effect (thanks to the unique structure of the stone), while common opals lack this special quality. Still, the common opal creates a gentle glow when held under the light. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "The precious opal has special play-of-color features. Unlike many other gems and minerals, precious opal has a unique feature known as “play-of-color.” This gives the stone the illusion that it has a myriad of colors inside, even if it’s just a trick of the light. [2] X Trustworthy Source Gemological Institute of America Nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards Go to source Hold up your raw opal and try looking at it from different angles—a genuine precious opal will show off some play of color. From a structural standpoint, opals are made of a variety of tiny spheres put together in a sort of grid. When the light enters this grid of spheres, the rays of light bend and split off into different colors, creating the unique and iconic color phenomenon that precious opals are best known for. Common opals are made up of larger or smaller spheres (or a smaller number of spheres), which prevents them from having the same opalescence. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "The surface is durable and paint- or pigment-free. Like any genuine gem or mineral, genuine raw opal won’t have any paint or pigment on the surface that modifies the color. Give your opal a quick rub-down with your fingers and see how it feels; if it feels like you’re touching the surface of the stone, you could be handling a genuine opal."

      "title": "The inside of the opal has good clarity under UV light.",
      "content": "The inside of the opal has good clarity under UV light. Authentic opal has a bright, luminescent appearance when it’s held up under a UV light; if the color looks muddy or faded, it might not be the genuine article. Synthetic opals are well-known for looking less luminous and bright with UV light. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that outside of a raw opal may look muddy and dirty if isn’t polished or cut by a professional. It’s important to look at what’s inside of the stone. Use caution with this test, since bright light can lead to fracture lines appearing within the opal.

      "content": "The surface of the stone is completely soot-free. Some manufacturers give their opals extra artificial treatments, like smoking or sugar treatments—soot marks can be indicative of this. [6] X Research source So, if you see soot traces on the stone, the opal might not be the real deal (and it definitely isn’t raw)."

      "title": "The stone is lustrous without looking overly shiny.",
      "content": "The stone is lustrous without looking overly shiny. Knock-off opals are often crafted with materials that have a super shiny surface, like resin or plastic. When you hold up such an opal, it’ll look especially shiny and reflective, unlike a genuine stone. The special patterns on the inside will also look organized and consistent, which isn’t representative of a genuine opal. [7] X Research source Pro tip: This isn’t always a viable option depending on where you’re shopping, but it’s possible to feel with your teeth if an opal is plastic or not."

      "content": "The surface can be scratched by a knife or steel nail. In the world of geology, the Mohs hardness scale uses a scale of 1 to 10 to determine how hard a gem or mineral’s surface is (with talc being a 1 and diamond being a 10). Opal falls somewhere in the middle, with a 5.5 to 6.5 rating. A knife or glass plate can scratch something with a hardness of 5.5 or less, while a steel nail can scratch anything less than 6.5. [8] X Research source If you’d like to be extra certain, try scratching the surface with a copper penny, which can only scratch gems/minerals with a 3.5 hardness or less."

If you’re buying the rock from a seller, ask where the opal was sourced from—historically speaking, Australia is one of the most well-known opal mining locations on the planet, although their resources are starting to decline. Still, it’s a good sign if your opal was originally mined in Australia, as that could be a sign that your stone is the genuine artifact. Some other countries well-known for the opal mining operations include: Brazil Honduras Ethiopia Czech Republic and Slovak Republic Indonesia"

Some opals have a more translucent background, while others look more opaque—with this in mind, the clarity of the opal isn’t always the best identifier.
