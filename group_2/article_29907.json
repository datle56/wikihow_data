      "content": "Make sure you have the necessary equipment. If you want to create and record a song, the best way to do so is by using a MIDI keyboard and USB microphone, as using your Mac's built-in microphone will severely diminish the quality of your recording. You can also use your computer's keyboard keys and built-in microphone to create your song, but the quality may suffer (especially the audio)."

      "title": "Plug in your equipment.",
      "content": "Plug in your equipment. If you're using a piano keyboard (or something similar) to record in GarageBand, you'll need to plug it into your Mac. If your Mac uses Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports instead of USB 3.0 ports, you may also need a USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter. Skip this step if you don't have a MIDI piano or similar controller. If you're using a USB microphone for the vocals, you'll want to plug it in as well."
