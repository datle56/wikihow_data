      "content": "Speak neutrally and logically. Channel your inner Spock and try to have conversations that express absolutely nothing about how you’re feeling. For example, if you're out to dinner and someone asks how your burger is, tell them it's medium-rare and a little greasy. Do not say it is delicious or gross, even if it is. Keep what you're saying short and to the point. If someone asks you how you're feeling or a question that you can't answer with facts, avoid the question by asking a question back. You can also give a vague or ambiguous response, like “okay” or “fine.” If someone asks if anything’s wrong, say something like, “I'm just tired.”"

[6] X Research source Raising your pitch can indicate excitement or agitation. Dropping your pitch and speaking very slowly can make you seem uncertain or upset. Try to speak in a monotone , or like you’re reading an instruction manual out loud. Dull, informative, and without originality will go a long way to keeping your conversations low-key.

      "content": "Don't use emotional or expressive words. Some words have very obvious emotional connections, like “angry,” “scared,” or “disgusted.” Others express an emotion or mood more subtly, like “creeping,” “sun-kissed,” or “breezy.” [8] X Research source Try to avoid obvious emotional words like “sad” or “happy,” as well as more subtle words like “determined,” “calm,” or “indecisive.” These words express just as much of your emotional state. Avoid using adjectives to describe words that will reveal your feelings. Don't say a movie was exciting or romantic. Instead, describe the film as action-packed or dramatic."

      "content": "Avoid hanging out with emotional people. “Try to limit your exposure to the news and things that are stressful so that you're not being consumed by it constantly all day long,” suggests Moshfegh. This includes emotional people who draw you into their drama. You don't need to cut anyone out of your life. Just try to respectfully avoid people who cause drama or limit contact with your more emotional friends. If you’re out and run into an emotional friend, have an excuse for why you can’t hang out ready to help you slip away without being rude. For example, say something like, “I’m sorry, I can’t talk. I’m running late for an appointment.”"

      "content": "Learn to accept things and be mindful. “ Mindfulness is also a very good tool to help manage emotions,” says Moshfegh. A big part of looking emotionless is ignoring things that bother you . Stay in the moment and accept what you can’t change. Once you realize you don’t have the power to change something, it might not bother you so much. If you give up trying to control things, you’ll also have an easier time accepting it when things don't go as expected. Controlling your emotions and reactions is a skill you can learn. Observe how your feelings flow through you and allow them to be there. It’s important to accept your emotions, but it doesn’t mean you have to show them to others. [9] X Research source"

The first step is to practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing , progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation .

      "content": "Look at money to help keep your emotions under wraps. It may sound odd, but looking at money tends to make people act more businesslike. [11] X Research source Scientists have found evidence that looking at money makes us less likely to approve of outward displays of emotion or to use emotional words to express our thoughts. Try looking at money for about 5 minutes before interacting with other people to help you get in a practical state of mind."

      "content": "Find an outlet for your emotions. No matter how well you keep everything inside, sometimes you need to let your emotions out. According to Moshfegh, “ Journaling is a very effective tool to help us manage stress and emotion.” She recommends giving yourself 15-20 minutes to write about how your day has been. Jot down what’s coming up for you. Write about anything stressful in your life or what you have on your mind. Moshfegh suggests spending time doing hobbies you enjoy or with people who uplift you. It doesn't matter what activity you choose as long as you can release any anxiety you have on your own terms instead of having a sudden meltdown in front of everyone. Some like playing music to release emotional pressure. Others may find something like physical activities, like kickboxing, work better."

It’s often the expression you naturally fall into when you’re alone.

If you want to make your resting expression more pleasant and approachable, raise your brows slightly, smile, and tilt your head a little."
