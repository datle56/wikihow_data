      "content": "Write and narrate your own audiobook on Audible. If you've published a book on Amazon , even if there's only a Kindle version available, you can easily release an audiobook version on Audible. When you publish your own audiobook through Audible's ACX (Audiobook Creation Exchange) platform, you'll earn money each time somebody purchases your audiobook on Audible, as well as through Amazon.com and iTunes. [4] X Research source You can hire a narrator with no up-front costs by opting to split the royalties 50/50. If you prefer to pay a narrator for their time up front, you can enjoy all of the royalties from your audiobook without having to share. Alternatively, you can narrate your own audiobook, or hire a narrator privately. Haven't written a book? Now's your chance to put those ideas to work! Whether you want to handle the writing yourself or hire a ghostwriter , writing and publishing a book on Amazon and Audible is a great way to make extra cash. To make even more money as an audiobook author, you can join the ACX Bounty Referral Program once you've published your Audible book."

If you love audiobooks, have an engaging speaking voice, and can read aloud clearly, you can make money as a narrator on Audible. This gig is best for people who are very comfortable reading aloudâ€”if you've ever done voice acting, have general acting experience, or have narrated books in the past, narrating audiobooks on Audible can be a solid source of income.

To make money as an Audible narrator, you'll need a quiet environment to record in, a non-squeaky chair, a good microphone (preferably a large-diaphragm condenser mic), a reasonably fast computer, and basic recording/editing software like Audacity, GarageBand , or Pro Tools . You'll need to create an account at ACX, which you can do by visiting https://www.acx.com/login .
