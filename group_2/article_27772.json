      "content": "Reserve the liquid from a can of oysters. Collect 4 tsp (20 ml) of canning juice from a can of shucked oysters. Pour this liquid into a small bowl. You will not need to use the oysters for this recipe. You can discard them or use them for another recipe. Transfer the oysters to a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid and refrigerate for up to one or two weeks."

      "content": "Combine the canning liquid with soy sauce. Pour 8 tsp (40 ml) of soy sauce into the bowl of oyster juices. Use a whisk to thoroughly mix the liquids together. You could use light or dark soy sauce, or a combination of the two. Alternatively, if you do not have any soy sauce, you could use teriyaki."

      "title": "Dissolve the sugar.",
      "content": "Dissolve the sugar. Sprinkle 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar into the liquid and whisk rapidly until the sugar is fully dissolved."

      "title": "Adjust the seasonings as needed.",
      "content": "Adjust the seasonings as needed. Taste the oyster sauce. If necessary, add another 1 tsp (5 ml) of oyster juice and/or another 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar. Mix well. You can add more soy sauce, as well, but do so carefully to avoid making the mixture too salty. Neither the saltiness of the soy sauce nor the sweetness of the sugar should be too overpowering."

      "content": "Use now or store for later. The oyster sauce can be used immediately, but if you want to save it for another time, pour it into an airtight plastic or glass container and refrigerate for up to one week."

    {
      "title": "Chop the oysters.",
      "content": "Chop the oysters. Drain the shucked oysters and reserve the liquid. Use a sharp kitchen knife to rough chop the oysters into smaller pieces. Use a container of pre-shucked oysters for this recipe instead of fresh oysters. The actual oysters will be filtered out of the sauce later, so you do not need to worry about cutting them into precise sizes. Making them smaller can help release the flavor faster, though, which is why chopping the oysters beforehand is generally a good idea."

If you want to save the cooked oysters, you can do so by transferring them to a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid.

Pour 1/2 to 1 Tbsp (7.5 to 15 ml) dark soy sauce into the mixture and stir it in, as well. [1] X Research source Using both light and dark soy sauces will give the taste of the oyster sauce more depth, but if you only have one type of soy sauce on hand, simply use a full 2-1/2 to 5 Tbsp (37.5 to 75 ml) of that soy sauce, instead. If you aren't sure about how much soy sauce to add, start by adding a smaller portion. Taste test the results and add more soy sauce if you want a stronger flavor."

Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Keep the lid off the pan this time.
