      "title": "Trace the template onto paper and cut out the crown.",
      "content": "Trace the template onto paper and cut out the crown. Cardstock, cardboard, or even poster paper are great options! Set the paper “wrong side” up, the side that won't be showing when you wear it. Lay the template on the piece of paper you will be using. Use a pencil to lightly trace the template onto the paper. Once complete, remove the template and cut out the crown. [3] X Research source If you want to use thinner paper, such as scrapbook paper or wrapping paper, glue it down onto a stiffer paper (such as cardstock) first. If you want your crown to be a special color (such as silver or gold), paint it first using spray paint or acrylic paint. Let the paint dry, then trace it, then cut it out."

      "content": "Reinforce the crown. Measure the length of the crown. Cut out a strip of cardboard or fabric that is the length of the crown and 1 to 1.5 inches wide. Line up the bottom edge of the strip with the bottom edge of the crown. Adhere this strip to the “wrong side” of the crown with glue. The cardboard or fabric will reinforce the crown and prevent it from ripping. Allow the glue to dry. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source To create a princess crown, use silver or gold glitter glue, and pink or purple gem stones. To create a royal crown, use gold glitter glue, and blue, red, green, or purple gem stones. To make a crown fit for an ice queen, use lots of silver or iridescent glitter glue. Use lots of blue and silver gem stones. If you want to make a creepy crown, consider using black glitter glue, and glueing on some plastic spiders and black or purple gem stones."

Leave the greens or smaller flowers, like the baby's breath, in bunches. Consider saving the leaves off of some of the larger flowers. These can make great fillers. Do not use scissors to cut the silk flower stems. Many silk flowers have wires inside the stems, which can ruin a good pair of scissors."

Here are some ideas on arranging your flowers: Place the largest flowers in the front, and use smaller flowers towards the end. Alternate large and small flowers. Consider looping long pieces of ribbon at the back of the crown."
