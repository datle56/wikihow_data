[1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In virtually all cases of high hemoglobin, the goal is to treat the underlying cause, which will in turn lower your hemoglobin level. Your hemoglobin level is a signpost that indicates a range of possible conditions that may need treatment. If it’s too low and needs to be higher, or too high and needs to be lower, your medical team will work to identify and treat the underlying cause or causes."

This will depend on whether your condition is relative, such as caused by tobacco use, or if it’s absolute polycythemia, which results in increased red blood cell (RBC) mass due to elevated serum erythropoietin or production of RBCs. Many different medical conditions can lead to elevated hemoglobin levels. Follow the advice of your medical team regarding the best treatment options for you. Common conditions that require treatment include: [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Dehydration Polycythemia vera , which is when your bone marrow produces too many red blood cells Heart problems, especially congenital heart disease Lung diseases, such as emphysema, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis Kidney cancer or tumors Liver cancer or tumors Hypoxia, which is when you have low blood oxygen levels Carbon monoxide exposure, usually due to smoking"

If it’s not a medical condition causing your elevated hemoglobin, then the culprit is likely an environmental factor or lifestyle choice. Work with your doctor to determine if lifestyle changes are recommended. Common examples include: [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Using tobacco products.

If so, you’ll likely undergo one or several phlebotomy treatments, during which a set amount of blood will be drained from your body. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If the underlying cause of your high hemoglobin is also being addressed, you should be producing new blood with normal hemoglobin levels.

Therefore, your dietary needs may be somewhat different from the standard advice, based on your particular circumstances. Work with your medical team to develop the proper diet for you. [8] X Research source In general, a healthy diet involves eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, and eating fewer packaged and processed foods, sugary drinks, refined grains, and unhealthy fats. If you have pre-diabetes or diabetes, you may be advised to limit your carbohydrate intake and adjust your protein and fat intake, based on your unique needs."

[14] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Health information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your doctor will fine-tune your treatment program based on your most recent HbA1c results. If you have pre-diabetes, which means you nearly meet the criteria for a diabetes diagnosis, your doctor might also recommend testing every 3 months.
