      "content": "Mold shapes with dough by hand or with cookie cutters. Salt dough is a great way for kids to make easy holiday decorations. It is easiest as a beginner to start with flat objects before advancing to 3D figures with details. Layering details over the initial figure should only be attempted when you feel confident about making the initial shape. Use a rolling pin to flatten out the dough before you use cookie cutters. To prevent your dough ball from drying out while you are working on a smaller piece, place a damp towel over the ball until you are ready to use it."

      "title": "Dry the decorations.",
      "content": "Dry the decorations. There are several different ways that salt dough can be dried: Air dry your decorations. Choose a warm, dry place to let the figures dry. Place figures on a grill to permit air circulation. This method will take about one week and is only suitable for small, flat and thin figures. Air dry and use an oven. Allow for a little drying by air and then bake the figure in the oven for half an hour at 50ºC (122ºF). You can increase to 100ºC (212ºF) after the initial half hour if more time is needed. Put your decorations directly into the oven. Set the oven at 180ºF (82ºC) for about 10 minutes. Dry directly on the oven rack to ensure even drying over the entire figure."
