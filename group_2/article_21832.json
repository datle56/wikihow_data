      "title": "Mark the spot where you plan to put the nail.",
      "content": "Mark the spot where you plan to put the nail. For traditional wreath placement, you will want to place the center of the wreath at eye level, and at the center of the door. Eye level is typically regarded as 57 inches (140 cm). [2] X Research source Add the radius of your wreath to the 57 inches (140 cm) height so that the center of your wreath falls at 57 inches (140 cm)."

    {
      "title": "Measure the nail.",
      "content": "Measure the nail. Before hammering the nail into your door, make sure that the nail will be an appropriate size to hold up the wreath. The nail should be long enough to project at least 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 inch (1.3 cm) past the portion of the wreath that it will be supporting, after being hammered into the door."

    {
      "title": "Hammer the nail into the door.",
      "content": "Hammer the nail into the door. Once you have checked the placement, hammer the nail into the door. Hold the nail at a sight angle, so that you are hammering the nail down into the door. Strike the end of the nail with the hammer until the nail is able to stand itself, and continue striking until the nail is firmly in the door, then hang the wreath."

      "title": "Repair your door.",
      "content": "Repair your door. After taking the wreath down and removing the nail, repair the nail-hole left in the door using wood putty. Work the wood putty into the hole and allow it to dry. Sand the wood putty down until it is flush with the door, and paint or re-finish as necessary to match the original appearance of the door."

      "title": "Choose a command hook.",
      "content": "Choose a command hook. Different command hooks can support different amounts of weight. Consequently, it is important to know both the weight of your wreath and the maximum capacity of your command hook."

      "title": "Clean the door with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Clean the door with rubbing alcohol. Wiping the door with rubbing alcohol and allowing it to evaporate will prepare the surface. Command hooks will allow you to hang a wreath without damaging your door, but need a clean surface in order to adhere properly. [3] X Research source Close the door. You'll need to be able to apply pressure to the door, which will be difficult if the door is free to swing."

      "title": "Mark the place where the command hook will go.",
      "content": "Mark the place where the command hook will go. Using a pencil, Remember that the hook on the command strip will be lower than the center of the strip, so measure this in advance. The center of your wreath should be at eye level, or 57 inches (140 cm). [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Attach the command hook to the door.",
      "content": "Attach the command hook to the door. Peel the non-adhesive backing off the command strip, and press the adhesive side of the command strip against the spot that you marked on the door. Pay attention to the directions that came with the command hook-- they will tell you how many seconds you need to press the adhesive to the door in order to ensure a good fit. If the command hook that you purchased has the hook built in, you are finished and can hang up your wreath, but if not, attach the hook and then hang the wreath."

      "title": "Look at your wreath hanger.",
      "content": "Look at your wreath hanger. Determine the end of your wreath hanger that is intended to go over the door. The more square end should fit snugly against the door frame, while the rounder side (if your over the door wreath hanger has one) will hold the wreath."

    {
      "title": "Close your door.",
      "content": "Close your door. Closing your door will allow you to ensure that your over the door wreath hanger is in a good place and fits well against your door. After you've closed the door and are satisfied with the placement of your hanger, hang your wreath! If the wreath hanger you have will not fit between the door and the frame, it could be because your door is slightly out of alignment, or because the wreath hanger you have is too thick for your door."

      "title": "Open the door.",
      "content": "Open the door. Leaving the door ajar will allow you to stand so that one arm is on either side of the door. You will need to hold two magnets on either side of your door. If for some reason you cannot do this, find a friend to stand on the other side of the door and hold one magnet while you place another."

      "title": "Add a protective pad to the magnet.",
      "content": "Add a protective pad to the magnet. If the magnetic wreath hanger you have purchased doesn't come with protective pads, you should add some kind of protection to keep them from scratching or scuffing the door. [6] X Research source Do this by cutting some cloth to size, or purchasing some floor scuff pads and attaching them to the magnets-- without this addition, the metal magnets could very easily scratch your door, especially if it is glass."

      "title": "Place the magnets on the door.",
      "content": "Place the magnets on the door. Begin by holding the magnets in the same place on either side of the door. You should feel the magnets be attracted to one another. The magnets should stay where they are, and can be used to hang your wreath. If you have a metal door, it isn't necessary that you use two magnets. [7] X Research source The fact that the door is metal should allow one wreath hanger to become attracted to it and support one magnet."

    {
      "title": "Hang your wreath.",
      "content": "Hang your wreath. Test the capacity of the magnets by gently placing the wreath on the hook. If the magnets begin sliding down, your wreath is probably too heavy for the magnetic wreath hanger. You may want to get a smaller wreath, stronger magnets, or use a different method to hang your wreath."
