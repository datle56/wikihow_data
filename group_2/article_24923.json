Ensure that the item is not blocking the bottom fan hole. If a book doesn't help, you can try something more uneven. Try sticking four sockets from an egg tray on four corners of your laptop.

Brands like Thermaltake, Xion, and Targus make cooling mats that are widely available at electronic stores. You can even buy risers, or computer stands, that have built-in fans and other forms of ventilation.
