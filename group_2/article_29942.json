      "content": "Relieve stress by repurposing old socks. You can buy new socks for the project, but why do that when you probably have a bunch lingering in the back of your sock drawer? Pick a sock with a colorful pattern that’ll help you smile on those stressful days. Wash the sock you’re going to use, and just like that, you have the start of your stress ball. [1] X Research source The size of your sock doesn’t matter. Just keep in mind that the size of your sock will be the size of your stress ball. A solid colored sock may be best if you want to add designs to your stress ball later."

      "content": "There are so many possibilities when it comes to fillings. Would you like a stress ball that’s squishy? Hard? Moldable? Choose between rice, playdough, beads, or other socks to fill your sock. Rice, beans, or other dry foods will give your stress ball that classic pleasing squeeze. If you want a range of textures to play with, add beans and rice to your sock. Playdough will give you that satisfying and moldable squish that is similar to a slime stress ball. Beads will be harder to squeeze but give you something more to play with in your stress ball. You can also find different shaped beads for added texture and stimulus. Socks will make your stress ball firm and feel more like a regular ball rather than a squeezable sack."

      "content": "Whatever you pick, your stress ball will be great. Just add your chosen texture into your sock to start forming your stress ball. If you choose rice, beans, or beads, use a funnel to fill your sock. The more you fill the sock, the firmer your stress ball will be, so make sure you leave enough room to let you squeeze. [2] X Research source No funnel? No problem! Place the sock inside a glass and wrap the opening of the sock around the rim. If you choose playdough, fill a plastic sandwich bag with playdough, close the bag after letting out the air, and then place the bag of playdough inside the sock. If you choose socks, roll one sock into a ball. Then take another sock and roll it into a ball around another sock. Repeat this with 5 socks, ending with the sock you want on the outside of your stress ball. [3] X Research source"

Pick your favorite soothing scents and add a few drops into your filled sock. [4] X Research source Lavender, orange, cedarwood, eucalyptus, spearmint, and cypress are common stress-relieving oils. If you’re using playdough, add the essential oils to the playdough before putting it inside the plastic sandwich bag."

No matter what you choose, your stress ball will be awesome! Wrap a rubber band around where you’ve pinched the sock until it’s tight and secure. [5] X Research source Tie a string around the opening tightly and secure with a knot. Sew your sock shut with a simple straight stitch , making sure to tie a knot at the end so your stitching doesn’t move. [6] X Research source"

Add a smiley face to your stress ball with permanent marker to remind you to smile even on the hardest days, or tie a ribbon around the top for some added flare.

Paint a pattern around your stress ball or write out your name in a fun font."
