Try not to rush him, and just focus on showing him you’re consistent with your affections. When he feels safe enough, he'll drop his guard, which is an important first step in getting him to fall for you. His need for emotional security can be pretty strong, so he will need to sense a certain degree of emotion from you before he can let himself feel the same way. Once he feels certain of your feelings, though, he's more likely to be free and honest with his own."
