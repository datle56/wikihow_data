      "content": "Eat whole grains and more fruits and vegetables. Choose whole-grain bread and pasta over white bread and pasta. Make sure to get at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every single day. Include produce high in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant, such as red peppers and tomatoes. Lycopene is what makes fruit and vegetables red, and has been proven as a cancer-fighting ingredient. In general, the deeper and brighter the color of your produce, the better. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source There are currently no guidelines as the amount of lycopene you should try to get each day. However, research indicates that for lycopene to make any difference, you would need to eat lycopene-foods all day to get the amounts needed. [3] X Research source Barber NJ, Barber J Nature Prostate and Prostatic Diseases , 2002, Vol 5 no 1 p 6-12. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, bok choy and kale are also good defenses against the development of cancer. Some controlled studies have found a link between increased ingestion of cruciferous vegetables and reduced risk of prostate cancer, although the evidence is merely associative at this point.

      "content": "Be more selective in your consumption of protein. Cut back on how much red meat you eat, including beef, pork, lamb and goat. It's also a good idea to limit your consumption of processed meats, like sandwich meat and hot dogs. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Instead of red meat, eat fish with high levels of omega-3 acids, including salmon and tuna. These foods will help your prostate as well as your heart and immune system. The research about the relationship between dietary fish intake and prostate cancer prevention is largely based on correlative data and namely, the fact that the Japanese have so few cases of prostate cancer and eat large amounts of fish. Whether there is a causal relationship is still being debated.

      "content": "Increase the amount of soy in your diet. The properties of soy, which is found in many vegetarian dishes, fight cancer. Sources of soy include tofu, soy nuts, soy flour and soy powders. Swapping cow's milk for soy milk in your cereal or coffee is one way to get more soy into your diet. Note that recent research has found soy beans and some other specific products, such as tofu, to be preventive in prostate cancer. However, this cannot be extrapolated to all soy products, including milk. There are also no current anecdotal or evidence-based guidelines on the amount of soy you should try to incorporate into your diet.

      "content": "Limit your salt intake. The best way to cut back on how much sodium you consume is to eat fresh produce, dairy, and meats and avoid packaged, canned, and frozen foods. Salt is often used as a preservative and is thus present in large amounts in pre-packaged foods. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source When shopping, stick to the outer perimeter of the grocery store as much as possible. This is where most of the fresh food is located, while cartons, cans, and other packages tend to be isolated in the center aisles. Take the time to read and compare food labels. Most food labels are now required to state how much sodium is in a product and what percentage it makes up of your daily recommended intake of sodium. The American Heart Association recommends that Americans consume less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day."

However, there may be cases where a supplement is a better option for you. Be sure to discuss any supplements you are taking or thinking about taking with your physician. Take zinc supplements. Many people do not get enough zinc in their diets, and supplements can help keep your prostate healthy. Research has demonstrated that zinc deficiencies can lead to enlarged prostates and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy. You can take 50 to 100 (or even up to 200) milligrams of zinc per day in tablet form to reduce an enlarged prostate. [12] X Research source Pamela Christudos, R Selvakumar, Joseph, Fleming.

Although the relationship of prostate cancer and smoking has been long debated, tobacco use is believed to cause oxidative damage via free radicals to the body's cells, thus making the link between cancer and smoking plausible. In a meta-analysis of 24 studies, researchers found that cigarette smoking was in fact a risk for prostate cancer.

Kegel exercises are performed by contracting the muscles of your pelvic floor (as if you were attempting to stop the flow of urine), holding them for a brief period, and then releasing them. Doing these exercises regularly will help strengthen and tighten the muscles of your pelvic floor. You can do Kegel exercises anywhere because they don't require any special equipment! Tighten the muscles around your scrotum and anus for a few seconds, then release. Do this exercise in 10 repetitions three to four times a day to improve your prostate health. Try to build up to 10-second holds. You can also do Kegel exercises by lying on your back with your pelvis in the air and clenching your buttocks. Hold for 30 seconds, then release.

Although for a long time, researchers believed that frequent ejaculation during sex, masturbation, or even a dream increased men's risk of developing prostate cancer, newer research is suggesting in fact, that frequent ejaculation may actually protect the prostate. Researchers suggest that ejaculation may help to flush out carcinogens in the prostate glands as well as help fluids in the prostate turn over more quickly to reduce cancer risk. In addition, regular ejaculation may also help to reduce psychological tension, which can slow the growth of cancer cells. [22] X Research source That said, this research is still in its early stages and researchers have said that it's too soon to yet make a formal recommendation on male sexual habits. It's unclear, for example, how often someone should ejaculate to see these benefits. These researchers do suspect, however, that ejaculation frequency accompanies other indicators of a healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet and regular exercise. [23] X Research source"

In fact, the risk is more than doubled! It's essential that you notify your doctor of any family history of prostate cancer so you can work together to build a comprehensive preventive program. Note that the risk is high for people with a sibling diagnosed with prostate cancer than a parent. In addition, the risk is increased for those people who have multiple relatives with prostate cancer, especially if those relatives were diagnosed at a young age (e.g., before 40). Ask your doctor to test to see if you have mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which may increase your chances of prostate cancer.

      "title": "See your doctor regularly.",
      "content": "See your doctor regularly. The American Cancer Society recommends getting screened for prostate cancer beginning at age 50 (or age 45 if you have any risk factors for prostate cancer). Screening involves the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. PSA is a substance made by both the normal and cancer the cells in your prostate that is found in a small amount in the blood. Most men have PSA levels of 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood, and the higher the PSA leve, the higher the chance of cancer. The gap between screenings depends on the results of this test. Men who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL need retesting every 2 years, whereas men with higher PSA levels should be tested annually. A digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be included in the screening. In this exam, a clinician will feel for a nodule on the back side of the prostate. Neither the PSA nor the DRE is conclusive. You will likely need a biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer. [26] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source At present, the American Cancer Society recommends that men should make an informed decision about prostate screening after detailed discussion with their primary care physicians. Screening can help locate cancers early, but there is no conclusive research as to whether screening actually saves lives. That said, catching the cancer earlier increases the chance that it can be treated successfully."
