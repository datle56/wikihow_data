For an exact measurement, use a candy thermometer to find the oil temperature. Follow the manufacturer's instructions when using a thermometer. If you don’t have a candy thermometer, place a wooden spoon into the hot oil. If the oil bubbles around the spoon, the oil is hot enough. Alternatively, throw a pinch of flour into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the flour, the oil is hot enough. If it turns black within a few minutes, the oil is too hot. Reduce the heat slightly."
