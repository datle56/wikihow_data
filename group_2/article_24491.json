      "content": "Manifestation on its own is not a sin, but it can be a conduit for one. If you’re manifesting something that will hurt yourself or others and your motivation is selfish, then it’s a sin. If you want to manifest something that’s helpful to others and doesn’t hurt anyone, then it’s not a sin. [1] X Research source For example: If you’re manifesting a new job so you can support your family, you’re not sinning. The end result helps others, your motivation is not selfish, and it inspires you to work hard. If you want to manifest an injury for an opponent in a football game so you can win, that’s a sin. The end result hurts someone, the motive is selfish, and you’re not working for the reward. In Christianity, manifesting is sinful if you believe you can make change in your life without the help or will of God."

      "content": "Manifestation is a method of attracting positive things into your life. In a literal sense, it’s the process of turning your thoughts and desires into a reality. This usually includes honing in on a specific goal or want, visualizing yourself obtaining it, and taking action to make it happen. Spiritually, it’s the idea of asking the universe to give you something by creating positive vibrations (good vibes). [2] X Research source It’s also sometimes called the Law of Attraction, or the principle that positive thoughts attract positive outcomes and negative thoughts attract negative outcomes."

      "content": "Sins are acts of lovelessness toward others or rebellions against God. In simpler terms, it’s something that hurts or offends other people. It could be something you do, like stealing, or something you say, like telling a lie. Your motivation is important, too—a good deed done for selfish reasons can also be a sin. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "No, as long as your manifestation is used for good.",
      "content": "No, as long as your manifestation is used for good. Manifestation is a tool for becoming confident and focused in yourself, your abilities, and the life you want. It isn’t a substitute or hack for religion. You can even manifest positive outcomes for your religion or church, like growing your congregation, spreading the word of God, or raising money for renovations. [4] X Research source Many aspects of manifestation—practicing gratitude, removing negative thoughts, trying to do good—actually align with aspects of Christianity and many other religions."

      "title": "No, as long as you’re not trying to circumvent or become like God.",
      "content": "No, as long as you’re not trying to circumvent or become like God. Part of manifestation is the idea that you’re co-creating an outcome with the universe. If you believe God created the universe and all things in it, then you’re actually asking or working with God. As long as God is in your manifestation equation somewhere, you will be guided toward a positive outcome for the greater good. [5] X Research source It’s worth noting that manifesting and praying are not the exact same thing. Praying is a way to communicate and feel close to God, whereas manifesting requires you to look inward and believe in yourself. [6] X Research source Some people are concerned that manifesting is the Devil’s work. As long as you’re doing it with positive, selfless intentions, you’re in the clear."

      "content": "There are several Bible verses that allude to manifestation concepts. The ideas of asking a higher power for help or guidance, believing that you can succeed or achieve because of your belief, and focusing on positive thoughts are all mentioned. As it turns out, faith and manifestation have a lot in common. [7] X Research source Here are a few such verses: Mark 11:24: Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. Matthew 21:22: If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. Romans 12:2: Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed, by the renewing of your mind."

      "content": "Manifestation is not wrong or sinful if your intentions are good. It’s a way to focus on gratitude, improve your circumstances, help others, and build confidence in yourself and your abilities. As long as you manifest in good faith and you’re willing to work for what you want, good things will come your way."
