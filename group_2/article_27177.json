Be sure to cut the \"hook\" off the end of end of your metal ring as well. If you are using a metal wire, cut about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) off with a pair of wire cutters. Wrap it around a pen or marker to shape it. [3] X Research source Do not use scissors, or you will dull them."

Try to use magnets made specifically for earrings; you can find them in the beading section of an art store. If you can't find them, any small, round magnets will work. Regular black magnets will be the least painful to wear, but they won't be very strong. Silver, \"rare earth\" magnets will be stronger, but they may also more painful for some people. If you have sensitive ears, do not use the silver-colored, \"rare earth\" magnets. They are too strong, and can pinch your ears. [5] X Research source"
