      "content": "A “hear me out” character is a strange, unconventional (and somewhat embarrassing) character crush. The basic idea behind these characters is that you’d have to justify your crush on them (and say, “Hear me out” to your friends) because they wouldn’t usually be considered crush-worthy. Hear me out, characters can be “questionable” for lots of reasons—they might be villains, animated, animals, or even inanimate objects! [1] X Research source Hear me out, characters aren’t just any old fictional characters, though. They’re often described as “unhinged” crushes. If a character is conventionally attractive and not animated (like Anthony from Bridgerton or Princess Leia from Star Wars ), they wouldn’t be “hear me out” characters because they aren’t unusual by society’s standards. A hear-me-out character’d be considered “out there” in terms of taste—like Joker from Batman (an insane clownish crime boss) or Karen from SpongeBob (a villainous supercomputer)."
