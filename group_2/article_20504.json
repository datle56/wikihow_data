      "content": "Determine if you need a resale permit. If you are selling goods, you'll need to collect sales tax on those goods in most states. Even if your state does not charge sales tax (for example, Oregon or Montana) it will have a Business License that functions in a similar manner to sales tax. As a seller, you'll be responsible for paying sales tax on each transaction regardless of whether or not you pass along this cost to the consumer. If you sell goods over the internet, such as through eBay or Amazon, to a buyer within your same state, you'll be responsible for collecting sales tax. If you live in Arizona, for instance, and sell to another resident of Arizona, you'll be responsible for paying sales tax on that item. If you sell less than $4,000,000 in annual sales, you are exempt from paying sales tax to buyers who live in other states. For example, if you live in Virginia, and sell to a buyer in Florida, you are exempt from collecting (and paying) sales tax on that transaction."

      "title": "Pay any required fee.",
      "content": "Pay any required fee. Most states charge a nominal fee for a resale number, if they charge a fee at all. If there is a set fee for the resale number application, you should pay it to the state department in charge of issuing resale numbers. For example, in the state of South Carolina, you will need to pay $50 to the South Carolina Department of Revenue. If you register online or in-person, you'll receive your resale number right away. If you register through the mail, it may be several weeks before your tax number is issued. However, you are free to start doing business right away. As long as you've applied for your resale number, you can start to charge sales tax."

      "content": "Know the benefits of getting a resale number. If you have a resale number, you won't be required to pay sales tax on items purchased for the purpose of resale. For instance, if you purchase a new desk, you'll have to pay sales tax on it. But if you buy a warehouse full of desks for the purposes of resale, you won't have to pay sales tax if you provide your resale number. Many wholesale and distribution companies will require you to prove that you are a licensed a copy of your reseller's license or your Sales Tax ID number to make sure you are a legitimate reseller that will be reselling the products you purchase.

In some cases, it may be possible to file for consolidated permit for multiple business locations.

      "content": "Request a replacement resale number if yours is lost. If your resale certificate is ever lost, damaged, or destroyed, you may request a replacement copy.

[2] X Research source You'll need to contact the same department from which you originally applied for a resale number. For example, if your resale number was issued through the state Department of Revenue, contact this office for a replacement copy. You can make sales and collect sales tax as long as your request has been issued. You don't have to wait until your physical copy of your certificate is restored."

For example, if you are in a partnership and you add or drop a partner, you'll need to make sure the state is aware of the change in your legal status. If you change your business address or your legal address, you'll need to update this information on your resale number application. If you decide to dissolve the business, you'll need to let the state know that you're no longer in operation. If you sell your business or purchase another business, you'll need to let the state know of these changes."
