      "content": "Choose a pair of frames based on your face shape. Once you have identified your face shape, you should look at frames that will complement your face shape. If you do not know your face shape, there are several charts you can look up online to help you determine this. You should also keep in mind certain frame styles you should avoid. [1] X Research source Round: If you have a round face, you have noticeable curves on both sides of your face and less defined angles, or cheekbones. The width and length of your face are mostly equal in size. Oval: Individuals with oval faces have balanced features, and their chin is slightly narrower than their foreheads. Oblong: If you have an oblong face, your face will be longer than it is wide. You will also have a long straight cheek line, and you may have a longer nose. Base-down triangle: If you have a base-down triangle face, you will have a narrow forehead that widens at your cheek and chin areas. Base-up triangle: If you have a base-up triangular face, you have a very wide top-third area of your face and a narrow or small bottom third of your face. Diamond: This is the rarest face shape, where you have a narrow eye line and jawline and broad cheekbones that are high and dramatic. Square: If you have a square face, you have a strong jawline and a wide forehead. The width and length of your face are the same proportions."

      "content": "Avoid round glasses for a round face. If you have a round face, you should go for eyeglasses that are square or rectangular to contrast the roundness of your face.

      "content": "Opt for wide frames if you have an oval-shaped face. If you have an oval-shaped face, you should look for frames that have a strong bridge and are wider than the broadest part of your face. Geometric-shaped frames tend to look good against an oval shape. You should avoid glasses that are oversized and cover up more than half of your face. Big frames can throw off the natural balance and symmetry of your face."

Frames in light colors and materials, as well as rimless frame styles, are also ideal for this face shape."

      "content": "Consider cat-eye frames for a diamond-shaped face. If you have a diamond-shaped face, you should look for cat-eye glasses or oval frames. These frames will play up your narrow forehead and chin and accentuate your cheekbones. Avoid boxy or narrow frames. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Play up your best facial feature. Your eyeglasses should work with your facial features, rather than against them. If you are proud of a certain facial feature, such as your blue eyes or your strong cheekbones, look for frames that show off this facial feature. [4] X Research source For example, you may choose blue frames to match your blue eyes, or you may look for red frames to match your red eyebrow hair. Or, you can play with contrasting colors. You could match purple frames with green eyes."

      "content": "Choose a frame color that complements your skin tone. Your skin tone should also complement your frames, as eyewear that works with your coloring will often look better on you. Your skin tone has been proven to be more of a deciding factor for eyeglass frames than your eye color or your hair color. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source If you have a cool skin tone, go for frames that are silver, black, pink, purple, blue, mauve, gray, and dark tortoise. These frames will not wash out your complexion. If you have a warm skin tone, look for frames that are the light tortoise, gold or honey, beige, olive green, and brown shades. Avoid pastels and white and black frames."

      "content": "Balance your eyebrows with your frames. Give your face more dimension by making sure your eyebrows fit with the look of your frames. If you have thick, bold frames in a bright color, you may want to keep your eyebrows simple and neutral so they do not compete with your glasses. You may do very light eyebrow maintenance, like plucking stray hairs and brushing your eyebrows out to keep them simple and clean. [7] X Research source If you have plain frames or rimless frames, you may want to play up your eyebrows and draw more attention to your eyes. Use an eyebrow pencil to lightly fill in your eyebrows, following the natural arch of your eyebrows."

      "content": "Wear glasses that match your wardrobe style. Consider how you would classify your style. Are you preppy, edgy, vintage, or athletic? Cat-eye frames would work well for a vintage style, but they might look out of place with an athletic wardrobe. If you wear a lot of a certain color, like purple, consider wearing glasses that match that color. For example, you may want to choose semi-round frames if you have a preppy style."

You can add a personal touch by choosing frames with metal accents or simple patterns.

Combining an updo with interesting eye makeup and bold lip color will ensure your face does not get lost in your hair or your frames. [12] X Research source If you have bangs, a high bun can help to show off the lower half of your face, and your bangs will act as a great frame for your eyeglasses."

If you have longer hair, past shoulder length, you can try curling the ends of your hair, and pinning back one side or both sides of your hair for a relaxed, casual look. This look is easy to do if you're strapped for time in the morning, and it will help show off your frames. [13] X Research source"

Show off your eyes by applying a cat-eye with eyeliner, or using eye shadow in a light color. Light eye shadow will highlight your eyes, but darker and bolder eye shadow may make your eyes appear too dark. [15] X Research source You can also wear an eye shadow that complements the color of your glasses. For example, choose a violet eye shadow if you wear yellow frames."
