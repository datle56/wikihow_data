Here are some idea to get you started: If you want chocolate ice cream, increase the sweetener to ⅔ cup (135 grams) and add ¾ cup (75 grams) of cocoa powder. [4] X Research source For mint chocolate chip ice cream: use ½ teaspoon of mint extract instead of vanilla extract, and ½ cup (65 grams) of powdered sugar instead of your usual sweetener. If you want the ice cream to be green, add 2 drops of green gel food coloring. [5] X Research source If you want to make strawberry ice cream, purée 2½ to 3 cups (500 to 600 grams) of sliced, frozen strawberries, then add the rest of the ingredients. You may want to decrease the sweetener to ⅓ cup (65 grams) and the vanilla extract to ¼ teaspoon. [6] X Research source"
