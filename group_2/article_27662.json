      "content": "Set yourself up for success by planning your first year. While Stardew Valley is an expansive game that lets you do almost anything you want, if you want to make a lot of money quickly you should plan out your first year to maximize the amount of progress you can make, as the items that help you earn more money are available later in the game. Spring: Your goals for Spring are to build a Chicken Coop (to get access to eggs so you can make Mayonnaise), get to level 90 in the Mines, and plant strawberries after the Egg Festival. You'll only get two Strawberry harvests, but if you use Speed-Gro Fertilizer you can increase this to three harvests. Summer: In the Summer you should aim to grow multi-harvest crops (like blueberries and hops) and to craft more sprinklers, as sprinklers greatly help cut down on your watering time every morning. Fall: By Fall you should be able to unlock the Greenhouse (complete the Pantry Bundle in the Community Center) and the Bus Stop (complete the Vault Bundles in the Community Center). You should also make tappers (to get resin from oak trees, an important ingredient for cask making) and iridium sprinklers. Winter: Focus on finishing the Community Center (if you didn't go the JojaMart route) and work on mining in the Skull Cavern."

      "content": "Collect as many forageables as you can. When you first start out, you won't be able to generate much passive income at first, so you should sell almost anything you collect. Try to collect as many forageables as possible to sell, but make sure you save at least one of each for the Community Center. Don't forget to check the Beach for items that washed up on the beach. If you find a forageable that is better than normal quality (no stars), sell those. These items are worth more money, and most of the Community Center bundles don't require a certain quality of item."

These seeds can be planted and will grow into a variety of seasonal crops that can then be soldâ€”or if you get lucky, you might get a Community Center bundle item. Though you won't make a lot of money off of growing Mixed Seeds, it's pure profit since the seeds are free."

While you should do as many want ads as you can, you should focus on growing the following crops for Help Wanted ads that pop up in each season: [1] X Research source Spring: Grow cauliflower, which can get you up to 525 gold per request. Summer: Grow melons. Villagers might put up an ad for a melon for a 750 gold reward, and Demetrius will ask by mail to buy one for 550 gold. Fall: Grow pumpkins, as these are the highest-paid requests during the season. A pumpkin request can net you up to 960 gold."

Just make sure there are no other villagers within a 15x15 tile square (with your character at the center) as they will get offended and lose 25 friendship points with you. The one exception is Linus, who will gain 5 friendship points if he sees you digging through the garbage."

      "content": "Select the best crops to grow to maximize your profit. Crops that grow all season are a better choice, as it saves you time from having to replant seeds. Note that while you're trying to finish the Community Center, make sure to grow the crops that are required for your bundles as well. You should also grow various crops to fulfil Help Wanted ads. [3] X Research source Spring: Strawberries (8 days grow time, then 4 days to regrow), cauliflower (12 days grow time), and potatoes (6 days grow time). Strawberry seeds can only be purchased at the Egg Festival, but you can buy extra seeds and hold on to them until next year or you can put a Strawberry in a seed maker to get more seeds. Cauliflower can turn into a giant crop, and there's a chance you'll get an extra potato for each plant you harvest. Summer: Blueberries (13 days grow time, then 4 days to regrow), melon (12 days grow time), hops (11 days grow time, then one day to regrow), and starfruit (13 days grow time). Blueberries and hops are good resources for making artisan goods. Melons can turn into a giant crop, and starfruit are very valuable (though a little tricky to get seeds for). Fall: Cranberries (7 days grow time, then 5 days to regrow), pumpkin (13 days grow time). Like many other multi-harvest crops, cranberries drop multiple items when harvested. Pumpkins can turn into a giant crop."

      "content": "Selecting the right skill professions can drastically increase your profits. While you're not locked in to any profession choice, it's better to make the best choice first to save yourself time and money. [4] X Research source Farming: Select Tiller at level 5 and Artisan at level 10. Unless you're focusing heavily on animals, Tiller is the best option for level 5. And the 40% profit increase on artisan goods from Artisan is a huge boost. Mining: Select Miner at level 5 and Blacksmith at level 10. The caveat is that if you select Blacksmith, you must sell iridium bars once you don't need them anymore. If you don't want to sell iridium bars, you should select Prospector. If you want to use Crystalariums, you should select Geologist and then Gemologist to increase your gem profits. Foraging: Select Gatherer at level 5 and Botanist at level 10. While you may not be foraging items much near the end of the game, finding high-quality forageables is preferred to the other occupation choices for the Foraging skill. Fishing: Select Fisher at level 5 and Angler at level 10. These two choices increase the amount your fish sell for, which is a huge boost as some fish can sell for quite a bit of money (especially if you get high-quality fish). Combat: Select Fighter at level 5 and Brute at level 10. These professions deal more damage to enemies, which helps you defeat them faster so you can get back to mining (which is what earns you money in the Mines)."

As Pale Ale sells for 300 a piece, you can get 5,040 gold in profit from one Hops plant (more if you use fertilizer or have the Artisan profession)."

And while you can make a profit off of selling the random gems you find while mining, the best way to increase your profit exponentially is to use a Crystalarium. Crystalariums replicate any gem or mineral placed inside of it, so if you have a whole host of Crystalariums, you can replicate Diamonds for a huge profit. [10] X Research source Crystalariums aren't unlocked until you've purchased the 25,000 gold bundle from the Community Center, so it may take some time to get one."
