      "title": "Combine sugar, water, and salt.",
      "content": "Combine sugar, water, and salt. Pour 1 cup (250mL) water, 1 cup (200g) white sugar, ¼ cup (50g) brown sugar, and a pinch of salt into a heavy pan. You can use any proportion of white and brown sugar. The more brown sugar you use, the richer the flavor will be."

    {
      "title": "Add vanilla bean (optional).",
      "content": "Add vanilla bean (optional). A real vanilla bean adds a more appealing flavor than vanilla extract. Slit the bean pod open lengthwise with a sharp knife, then scrape out all the goo into the syrup. Drop in the bean pod as well. If using vanilla extract instead, don't add it yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat and stir until dissolved.",
      "content": "Heat and stir until dissolved. Stir for a few minutes over medium heat, until all of the sugar crystals have dissolved. You may need to bring it to a boil for a couple minutes. If any crystals are floating in the water or stuck to the pan, your syrup might crystallize in storage."

    {
      "title": "Transfer to a clean container.",
      "content": "Transfer to a clean container. Wash a jar in hot, soapy water. Fill it with syrup, pouring through a mesh if your syrup contains vanilla bean. Seal the container. To prolong shelf life, sterilize the jar with boiling water instead."

    {
      "title": "Let cool.",
      "content": "Let cool. The syrup will thicken as it cools to room temperature."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir in vanilla extract.",
      "content": "Stir in vanilla extract. Mix 2 tsp (10mL) vanilla extract into the syrup. Skip this step if you used a vanilla bean."

      "title": "Add to cola or store in the fridge.",

      "title": "Pour cola into a tall glass.",
      "content": "Pour cola into a tall glass. Pour chilled Coca-Cola or another cola drink into a tall glass for easier stirring. This recipe assumes you're using a 12 oz (355mL) can."

      "title": "Mix in vanilla syrup.",
      "content": "Mix in vanilla syrup. Stir it with at all spoon until completely dissolved. Start with ¾ tbsp (12mL) syrup, taste test, and increase as high as 2 tbsp (30mL) if the drink needs more vanilla flavor."

      "title": "Turn it into a Polar Bear.",
      "content": "Turn it into a Polar Bear. The \"Polar Bear\" is based on a menu item at an Oregon restaurant. To make it, add 2 tbsp (30mL) half-and-half to your imitation Vanilla Coke. [2] X Research source Soda can curdle dairy products, but fatty dairy products like half-and-half are usually fine. To reduce the chance of curdling, keep the ingredients and glass cold."
