      "content": "Start with the short sounds of fundamental vowels. There are 5 fundamental vowels in Sanskrit. However, the fifth is rarely used. The 4 fundamental vowels that form the basis for all other vowel sounds are a, i, u, and ṛ . [3] X Research source a is pronounced like the u in the English word \"but.\" This letter is described as the sound of an exhalation. In Sanskrit, it is considered the starting point of all other sounds in the language. i is pronounced like the i in the English word \"bit.\" u is pronounced like the u in the English word \"put.\" There is no true English equivalent for the ṛ sound. It sounds a bit like you are saying \"ruh.\" Comfortable with Sanskrit vowel sounds? Jump to info on pronouncing consonants ."

      "content": "Pronounce long vowels exactly twice as long as short vowels. Each of the short vowels can be made longer by drawing out the pronunciation. The sound of long vowels and short vowels also differs, much like long and short vowels in English. A long vowel is indicated by a macron, a long bar over the letter. [4] X Research source ā is pronounced like the a in the English word \"star.\" ī is pronounced like the ee in the English word \"teeth.\" ū is pronounced like the oo in the English word \"mood.\" A long ṛ is rarely used, but essentially sounds like a longer, more drawn-out version of the short-vowel pronunciation. The pronunciation of this vowel is incredibly varied."

      "title": "Progress to compound vowels.",
      "content": "Progress to compound vowels. The fundamental vowels are classified as \"weak\" vowels in Sanskrit. When you combine two weak vowels together, you get a strong or medium vowel. Strong and medium vowels are pronounced twice as long as short vowels, or the same length of time as long vowels. [5] X Research source e is a medium vowel pronounced like the a in the English word \"mane.\" It is a simplified version of the classical \"ai,\" which is why it is still considered a compound vowel even though it is only one letter. o is a medium vowel pronounced like the o in the English word \"go.\" It is a simplified version of the classical \"au.\" ai is a strong vowel that is a combination of the short a and short i sounds. Classically, this combination was written \"āi.\" Pronounce each letter separately, gliding them together. Keep the initial a sound short. au is a strong vowel that is a combination of the short a and short u sounds. Classically, this combination was written \"āu.\""

The air flow through the mouth is continuous, as with vowels, but it is lessened. [6] X Research source ya sounds similar to the y in the English word \"yellow.\" ra is a sound not present in the English language, but it sounds somewhat like \"drah.\" It's somewhat similar to the dr in the Greek word \"drachma.\" la sounds similar to the l in the English word \"loose.\" va sounds similar to the v in the English word \"vase.\""

      "content": "Organize consonant sounds by their points of pronunciation. If vowels are the sound of the breath, consonants represent a stoppage of breath. When you pronounce words in Sanskrit, you stop the breath at different parts of your mouth to form the consonant sounds. [7] X Research source There are 5 pronunciation points in Sanskrit, related to the part in your mouth where the air flow is stopped: the soft palate (at the very back of your mouth), the hard palate (at the top of your mouth), the hard bump behind your teeth on the roof of your mouth, your lips, and the base of your teeth. The Sanskrit alphabet is organized logically with the vowels first, followed by the consonants, which are grouped together according to their points of pronunciation. When naming a Sanskrit consonant, you simply add the vowel a to the end of it."

[9] X Research source ca produces a sound similar to \"chah,\" although the point of pronunciation is different from the English \"ch.\" ja is sounds similar to the j in the English word \"joe,\" although it's a smoother sound, more like a \"zzh\" sound. ña sounds similar to the \"ñ\" in the Spanish word \"mañana.\""

Like hard palate consonants, retroflex consonants in Sanskrit are sounds unfamiliar to those who speak English. To make the sound, bend your tongue up and slightly back to press the tip of your tongue just behind the bony bump on the roof of your mouth. This is the ridge just behind your front teeth. [10] X Research source ṭa produces a sound similar to the English \"t,\" although the point of pronunciation is different. The sound is more rounded. ḍa produces a sound similar to the English \"d,\" although the point of pronunciation is different.

You can also compare the difference between the p sound in \"pit\" and in the word \"spit.\" [13] X Research source There are 2 soft palate aspirated consonants: kha and gha . These produce a sound similar to the related non-aspirated consonants, just remember that extra puff of air. There are 2 hard palate aspirated consonants: cha and jha . Remember that the h following the first consonant is simply an indication to aspirate – this isn't a blended consonant. There are 2 retroflex aspirated consonants: ṭha and ḍha .

[14] X Research source śa is a hard palate consonant that produces a sound similar to the sh sound in English, although it has a different point of pronunciation. Try saying the word \"petshop,\" but leave your tongue in the same position as it was for the t while you make the sh sound. ṣa is a retroflex consonant that also produces a sound similar to the sh sound in English.

If someone thanks you, respond with susvaagatam , which means \"you're welcome.\" You could also say chintaamastu , which means \"no worries.\" Use kshamyataam to say \"excuse me\" or to get someone's attention.
