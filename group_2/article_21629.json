      "title": "“I’m attracted to you.”",
      "content": "“I’m attracted to you.” Reaching to put his hand on your thigh is a classic move in the flirting handbook, especially when the two of you are already having a good time. It’s often a way of saying, “I really enjoy myself around you, and now I want to make it clear that I’m into you.” That physical contact is usually the first step to breaking the barrier of touch. He’s likely hoping that you feel the same way and might reciprocate his touch. Reaching over to touch your thigh is especially romantic when you’re riding in a car together. If he’s driving, his movement is already limited, so touching your leg is one of the go-to moves."

      "title": "“I want to protect you.”",
      "content": "“I want to protect you.” If a guy likes you, he probably feels protective of you, or like he needs to come to your defense—it’s one way to show he cares. [1] X Research source By touching your thigh, he might be trying to show you he’s taken it upon himself to be your protector, which might point to his romantic feelings. After all, we want to protect the ones we love."

    {
      "title": "“I feel possessive over you.”",
      "content": "“I feel possessive over you.” Men often flirt by showing dominant body language. [2] X Research source This could include things like wrapping an arm around your shoulder, opening the car door for you, and yes, placing their hands on your thigh. He might be telling you that he feels like you’re his, and he wants you to know it. He’s proud to be sitting next to you, and wants the rest of the world to know it, too. Out of all the people around, you chose to sit next to him. Of course, dominance is only sweet up to a certain point. If he’s aggressive or overly possessive , it may be time to reconsider his status as boyfriend material."

    {
      "title": "“I want to see how you’ll respond.”",
      "content": "“I want to see how you’ll respond.” Sometimes a guy is into you , but wants to pick up on other signals before he leans in for a kiss or professes his love. Placing a hand on your thigh could be one of the ways that he gauges your attraction to him, especially if he’s shy. If you respond positively by smiling , making eye contact , or reciprocating, then he knows he has the green flag. If you pull away or act nervous, then a respectable guy will get the message and take his hand back."

    {
      "title": "“I want to take our relationship further.”",
      "content": "“I want to take our relationship further.” Sometimes, you and a guy already know that you’re into each other, but you haven’t bridged the physical gap yet. If he initiates contact with his hand on your thigh, he might be asking a sort of question, like, “Is it okay if I touch you?” and that’s your opportunity to respond. If you’re both down, then congrats! You’ve just moved your relationship status from “talking” to “touching,” and things will probably get more serious from there."

    {
      "title": "“I want to take things to the bedroom.”",
      "content": "“I want to take things to the bedroom.” Sometimes a guy touches your thigh to signal that he wants to make things a bit more intimate between the two of you, and not just in the hand-holding kind of way. This is especially true if he’s driving you home, or if you’ve really felt the sparks while chatting at a bar or a restaurant. He’s just touching your thigh for now, but he may be hoping that things get a little more passionate behind closed doors."

    {
      "title": "“I’m being vulnerable in front of you.”",
      "content": "“I’m being vulnerable in front of you.” It takes a lot for some men to show any sort of emotion, and romantic advances require a certain amount of vulnerability. [3] X Research source Touching your thigh could be his way of showing you that he’s comfortable enough around you to be tender. He’s communicating that he trusts you and is willing to let his guard down around you to take that big leap toward physical intimacy. In this situation, taking his hand can be a welcome and powerful way to acknowledge his feelings."

    {
      "title": "“I want to show my support for you.”",
      "content": "“I want to show my support for you.” Research shows that physical contact with another person can help relieve stress or anxiety. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source We often touch people who are close to us to show them that we’re here for them, even if we don’t think of them romantically. By touching your thigh, he might be telling you that he’s on your team or that he has your back, especially if you’ve been having a tough conversation or confiding in him."

    {
      "title": "“Oops, that was an accident.”",
      "content": "“Oops, that was an accident.” Of course, and we hate to say it, there’s always the chance that the touch was accidental, and that everyone’s sending and receiving the wrong signals. [5] X Research source He might have been reaching for something, or misplaced his hand when he meant to place it at his side. The good news is, if he’s into you, he’ll probably give your more signals, so look for other signs that he’s flirting , like leaning in close or offering other small touches."

      "title": "“We’re just good friends.”",
      "content": "“We’re just good friends.” Romantic partners aren’t the only people who offer each other tender touches. Family members and even good friends do things like touch each others’ shoulders or even hold hands. [6] X Research source If you’ve known each other for a while, it may just be that he feels comfortable showing some platonic intimacy , especially if he touches you in other non-romantic ways, like patting your shoulder or offering hugs when you see each other. To tell if a good friend is into you , look for other signs, like giving you frequent compliments, teasing you coyly, or touching your hair or face."

      "content": "Consider your relationship and what you want from it first. First thing’s first: Ask yourself if you’re really into this guy in a romantic way. If you’re totally attracted to him, then it’s time to rev the engines. But it could be that you need a little more time to think, in which case the two of you might lay off the gas. And if you’re absolutely not into him that way? Slam on the breaks and let him know you don’t like him like that before things go any further. Also ask yourself: Do you want a romantic relationship with him? Do you want to be physically intimate with him? Do you trust him, and was the touch respectful? If you say “No” to any of these, it’s time to slow things down."

      "content": "Evaluate the context of the thigh touch next. Asking yourself how the thigh touch happened is just as important as asking why. First, was it an accident? If he kept his hand there, probably not. If that's the case, consider if the context was romantic. Are the two of you on a date? Are you talking about romance or relationships? Do you interpret his body language as flirting? If the context is romantic and you’re into him, then feel free to make your move. On the other hand, if the context was more platonic (like if he’s offering sympathy or just showing his affection as a friend), then a friendly smile is all the response you need to give."

      "title": "Reciprocate the touch if you feel comfortable.",
      "content": "Reciprocate the touch if you feel comfortable. The easiest way to reciprocate is just by placing your hand on his thigh, too, to show him that you’re comfortable and that you feel the same way he does. Or, you might touch his arm or even hold his hand to mix things up while still sending a positive message. Also, flirt by holding his eye contact and turning toward him to give him your full attention and signal that you’re receptive to his advances."

      "content": "Escalate the flirtatious touching if you’re into him. Now that you’re both on the same page, it’s time to pump the gas. If you’re able, lean or snuggle against him to show him that you’re comfortable with physical intimacy and want more of it. Then, if the moment feels right, go in for the kiss! It doesn’t have to be intense; a peck on the cheek or even kissing the back of his hand sends a good message. Or, get him to kiss you by batting your eyelashes or leaning in close to his face. You might also just ask for a kiss!"

      "content": "Turn him down if you’re uncomfortable. If you’re not totally confident that you want any sort of relationship with this guy, or if he’s being something of a creep, don’t hesitate to let him know. Turn him down gently by saying, “Sorry, I’m not really comfortable or ready for that kind of touch.” If he’s being persistent or needs a stronger message, say, “I don’t like it when you touch me. Please move your hand.” If you feel unsafe for any reason, remove yourself from the situation, call a friend, or even fake a call from a friend to get out of there quickly and safely."

      "title": "Eye contact",
      "content": "Eye contact Eye contact doesn’t always mean he’s into you, but if he is, then it will most likely be there. Someone who wants to catch your attention will most likely do so with their eyes. Holding your gaze tells you that he’s present and focused on you. But there’s a balance! A guy who can’t seem to stop staring at you, even when you appear nervous, is more creepy than romantic. On the other hand, if he seems sweet but has trouble making eye contact, he might just be shy, and there’s nothing wrong with that."

      "title": "Compliments",
      "content": "Compliments Compliments are a classic way to flirt with just about anybody. If he showers you with flattering comments, then chances are he’s very much into you. There’s a right and respectful way to pay a compliment, though. If he only ever compliments your looks, take that as a red flag . But if he drops comments on things like your opinions, perspectives, or pretty much anything other than your appearance, then he’s probably as genuine as he is charming."

It’s a sign that he values your brain as well as your body, and that he could be a real catch."
