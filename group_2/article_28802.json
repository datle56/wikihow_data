      "content": "Don't overdo it. If you say something so complex and outrageous, no one will be impressed. Here's an example: say someone calls you fat. Don't say: \"Well, I could use my belly to blow your skinny face into the ground.\" It just seems pathetic, trying to save face with humor. Instead, maybe try \"Well it's better to be fat and happy rather than a stick like yourself.\""

      "content": "Be clever enough to make it so they can't think of another comeback to your comeback. Like someone says you're the stupidest person ever, you could say, \"And why are you telling me this?\" The only thing they could say after that is, \"Cause you can't do anything good.\""

      "content": "Pretend to be in a hurry and say, \"I don't have time for this.\" Maybe an even better comeback would be \"I don't have time for immature viewpoints such as yours\", then walk away. It leaves them in the dust. Be sure not to sound panicked like \"Oh crap! Oh no, I don't have time for this!\" Make it so you seem superior to them."
