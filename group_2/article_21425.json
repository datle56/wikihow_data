      "content": "Peel the outer layer of a strawberry and dry it in the sun to collect seeds. To get strawberry seeds from home-grown or store-bought berries, cut off the top layer of skin containing the tiny, yellow seeds with a knife. Then, lay the peels on a paper towel and dry them in the sun for 2 to 3 days. Simply rub the strawberry skins to loosen the seeds and collect them in a bowl. [1] X Research source Most store-bought strawberries are hybrids of several different varieties. The fruit from their seeds tends to be smaller than the berries you buy in the store. If you don’t want to collect your own seeds, use strawberry seed packets . Strawberries come in 3 varieties: June-bearing, everbearing, and day-neutral. June-bearing berries produce a single harvest in mid-summer while everbearing and day-neutrals produce fruit throughout the summer and fall. [2] X Research source If you’re growing your strawberries in containers, day-neutral or everbearing are the best options."

      "content": "Plan to start strawberry seeds 12 weeks before your area’s last frost. The last frost date is typically the last day in spring when your area experiences freezing weather. Starting your seeds 12 to 16 weeks before this date allows your seeds to sprout and be ready for transplanting as soon as the weather is warm. [3] X Research source Search for your area’s last frost date online. Or, find the date using a last freeze map if you live in the US."

      "content": "Refrigerate the seeds for 4 to 6 weeks to speed up germination. In the wild, the cold, winter weather signals to strawberry seeds that it’s almost time to sprout. To mimic this process, which is called cold stratification, pour your seeds into an air-tight storage container. Then, set the container in your fridge for about 1 month. [4] X Research source If you’re using a seed packet, simply set the pack in the fridge. For faster cold stratification, freeze the seeds for 2 weeks. [5] X Research source Strawberry seeds still germinate if you don’t put them in the fridge. Your seeds might just take longer to sprout."

To trap in moisture and keep the seeds hydrated, place plastic wrap, a plastic bag, or a sheet of glass over the seed tray. Then, place your seeds in a bright spot indoors, like a windowsill, that gets plenty of sunlight in the morning. [7] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source If you don’t have a sunny spot in your home, place a grow light 2 inches (5 cm) above the seeds. Strawberry seeds germinate the best at temperatures between 65 to 70° F (18-21° C). If you live in a cooler area, place a heat mat underneath the tray."

When you see the little green seedlings, take off the plastic cover over the tray. Then, monitor the soil moisture by sticking your finger 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep into the dirt. If the soil is dry, mist the seedlings with water. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Harden off the seedlings when they have 2 to 3 sets of true leaves. Slowly acclimate, or harden off, your strawberry seedlings to outdoor conditions before you plant them in your garden or in containers. Start by setting your seed tray outside in partial sun for 1 hour. Then, gradually increase the amount of sun the seedlings get over the course of 1 week. [9] X Research source True leaves are the leaves that grow after the 2 round seed leaves that sprout from the seedling. Hardening off is an important process that prevents your seedlings from being shocked or damaged by outdoor conditions."

      "content": "Pick a spot outside that gets full sun and has well-draining soil. Strawberries thrive when they receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight. They are also sensitive to moisture and don’t like for their roots to stay wet. So, make sure the sunny spot is also full of sandy loam soil that drains well. [10] X Research source Check that your soil drains well by digging a hole that’s 12 in (30 cm) wide and deep. Then, fill the hole with water. If it drains in less than 10 minutes, your soil is well-draining. [11] X Research source If your soil doesn’t drain well, add compost , peat moss , or decomposed manure to your planting area."

If your soil needs adjustments, the test gives you the NPK ratio that your soil needs. Then, add a fertilizer that matches the recommended NPK ratio to the soil. [12] X Research source For instance, if your test results recommended an NPK ratio of 3-1-2, use a fertilizer with a 3-1-2 NPK ratio on the label. Many experts advise applying a balanced fertilizer, like 10-10-10 NPK , to the soil before you plant. Just add 1 lb (0.45 kg) of fertilizer for every 100 sq ft (9.3 m 2 ) of plants and work it about 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) into the dirt.

If the soil pH is very acidic, or below 6.0 pH, spread granular or pulverized agricultural lime over the damp soil about 2 to 3 months before you plant. If the soil pH is very basic, or above 6.5 pH, apply aluminum sulfate or sulfur over your soil instead. [14] X Research source The amount of lime, sulfate, or sulfur you need depends on the pH of your soil. Use a pH adjustment graph to find out how much you need."

To give your strawberry plants plenty of space to grow, space them about 12 to 24 inches (30-61 cm) apart, depending on the variety. Just dig a hole deep enough to bury the roots beneath the ground, making sure that the crown, or base of the plant, is not buried. [15] X Research source For June-bearing strawberries: space them 12 to 24 in (30-61 cm) apart. For day-neutral strawberries: space them 8 to 12 in (20-30 cm) apart. For everbearing strawberries: space them 12 in (30 cm) apart."

Just choose a pot, hanging basket , or window box with drainage holes that’s at least 8 inches (20 cm) wide. Fill the pot with loose, loamy potting soil that’s well-draining. Then, dig a hole in the center that’s deep enough to bury the roots of the plant. Plant a single strawberry plant in each container if you’re using regular pots. Strawberry jar planters and trug planters , which are raised, table-like planters, can hold about 8 strawberry plants in 1 container. Hanging baskets can hold about 6 strawberry plants, while window boxes can hold about 4. [16] X Research source"
