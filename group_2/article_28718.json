      "content": "Show him that you like him. As a more sensitive, shy sign, the Cancer man you have your eye on may need some more encouragement to make a move. [1] X Research source Start by being friendly, and work your way up towards being flirty as you get to know him. You want to move at a gradual, authentic pace when trying to woo a Cancer. Say \"Hi\" and smile anytime you see him at school or work. Stop at his locker or his desk and ask how his day is going if you have time. Reply to his Instagram story or send him a text message with something that reminds you of him. He'll be flattered and intrigued to get to know you more. When the two of you chat, laugh at his jokes and make eye contact with him. To flirt, greet him with a hug when you see him or touch his shoulder when you say goodbye."

      "title": "Be direct to show your interest.",
      "content": "Be direct to show your interest . A Cancer man may need some confirmation that you like them before they start chasing you. Ask him out on a date or even tell him you like him. If you're not comfortable with that just yet or you're still getting to know him, ask him to hang out with a group of your friends or see if he wants to study with you after school. Whatever you do, be open about your interest in getting to know him better. Next time you talk, ask him if he would like to hang out or go on a date. Say something like, \"I have so much fun when we run into each other. Would you ever want to get coffee or something?\" If you're not comfortable asking him out just yet, try a group hangout. Text him something like, \"A few friends and I are going to see a movie next week. Would you wanna come?\" Avoid playing hard to get or trying to make him jealous. Cancers want something genuine, and they won't enjoy playing games."

      "content": "Cancers are known for being pretty romantic and affectionate signs. As you get to know each other, show him the same type of affection. Give him small sentimental gifts that show you've been thinking of him or do something nice for him just because you care. Your generous heart and sensitivity will appeal to him and help you stand out as the person he wants to be with. [2] X Research source Make him a playlist of songs you think he would like and share it with him. Throw in a few of your favorite songs and give the playlist a fun name to personalize the mix. If he mentions that he enjoys reading poetry, stop by a book shop and buy him a book of poetry you've always liked. Write a little note inside that says something like, \"I've always liked these poems. I thought you would appreciate them.\""

      "content": "Be patient and let him express himself at his own pace. The symbol of Cancer is the crab for a reason. He may have a tough shell, but thereâ€™s a sensitive soul inside. Be friendly and encouraging in your interactions, and respect his pace if things stay at the friend stage for a little longer than usual. As super genuine people, a Cancer won't want to force anything before they're ready. When you're first getting to know him, keep saying \"Hi\" and asking him how he's doing. He may seem shy at first, but he'll likely start approaching you, too. As you start spending time together, keep making regular plans. After you hang out the first time, send an encouraging text like, \"I had so much fun tonight! I'd love to see you again if you're up for it.\" If after some time, he still continues to be reluctant to open up or hang out again, he may not be interested in a romantic connection."

[3] X Research source Talk to him openly about all of your unique interests. If you like playing Taylor Swift songs on the guitar sometimes, share your favorite song to play and why. It may feel a little weird to be your real self around a guy that you like, but that authenticity helps you stand out and seem more approachable."

[4] X Research source He'll be drawn to how real you are. [5] X Research source When he asks you about your day, give him an honest account. Instead of just saying \"Good,\" say something like, \"It's been pretty good. This rainy weather has been a bit of a bummer lately but I'm pushing through! How are you?\" Give him space to talk about his feelings, too. Ask him how he's doing when you see him and stick around for a real conversation."

Text him before and after pictures to show off your knack for reorganizing."
