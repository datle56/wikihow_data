      "content": "Collect 1/2 cup of bruised petals (20 petals). If possible, remove the petals from roses that have a strong scent and are in the early stage of their bloom. Roses tend to lose their scent over time, so it is best to pick the petals before the rose has fully bloomed.

      "title": "Lay the petals flat on paper towels to dry.",
      "content": "Lay the petals flat on paper towels to dry. Pour the bowl of water and rose petals into a strainer to get rid of the bulk of the water. Then, gently place the petals in a single layer on paper towels to dry. The petals normally take about 1 hour to dry. [4] X Research source Make sure that the petals are out of the wind so that they don’t blow away."

      "content": "Tap the petals gently with a wooden mallet. Put the sealed bag of petals onto the ground and then lightly hit it with a wooden mallet until the petals look bruised. This damages the cells in the petals and helps to bring out the oil and scent. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a wooden mallet, use a heavy can or rolling pin to bruise the petals instead."

      "content": "Leave the jar to sit for 1 day. This gives the petals time to infuse into the oil. Place the jar in a safe place that is away from extreme hot or cold temperatures. The kitchen bench and the kitchen cupboard are good storage options. [12] X Research source After 24 hours, the majority of the oil will have been released from the petals."

      "title": "Strain the oil to remove the petals.",
      "content": "Strain the oil to remove the petals. Place a strainer over another glass jar and then pour the oil into the jar through the strainer. Make sure to use a strainer that is finer than the rose petals to avoid any fragments slipping through the holes. [13] X Research source If any rose petals get through the strainer, simply fish them out with a spoon."
