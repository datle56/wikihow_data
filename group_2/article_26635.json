      "content": "Take a daily aspirin to reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke. An over-the-counter aspirin may help keep your heart healthy if you have a high coronary calcium score. However, due to the risk of side effects, you should only begin a daily aspirin regimen if your doctor recommends it. Aspirin can help people with high blood pressure, a family history of heart disease, kidney problems, diabetes, or a history of smoking. Do not use aspirin if you have liver or heart failure or stomach ulcers. People under 21 should not take aspirin."
