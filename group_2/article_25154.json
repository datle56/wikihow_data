      "content": "Approach the kiss with confidence . Try to kiss their cheek so they turn their head your way. Once you've chosen the right moment to kiss someone, there's no turning back, especially if it's your first time kissing that particular person. Be decisive and confident.

      "content": "Set the mood. If you truly want your kiss to be passionate, you will need to set the right mood. That doesn't mean that you have to throw rose petals everywhere and light a hundred candles, but you should be someplace without many distractions--that way you can both focus on each other (and your passionate kiss)."

Close your eyes as you do to heighten the intimacy and to avoid looking at the pores on your partner's nose. Imagine your eyes are being controlled by a dimmer switch.

      "title": "Let yourself linger between kisses.",
      "content": "Let yourself linger between kisses. Kiss your partner once, slowly, letting it last for a few seconds. Then slowly draw your lips away, keeping them close enough to your partner's lips so that they are almost touching (but aren't). This lingering will help build the passion, and will really capture your partner's full attention (pfft, as if you didn't have it already)."

      "title": "Open your lips slightly.",
      "content": "Open your lips slightly. Once the kiss is accepted, try opening your lips slightly. If the other person follows suit, try slightly varying the openness of your lips (both more and less open) throughout the kiss. You may wish to explore the person's lips and tongue a bit with the tip of your tongue. There are no rules; just try to make your motions smooth. Keep in mind that there is a thin line between passionate kissing and a drool fest. In order to gauge how wet your kisses should be, kiss the back of your hand like you would if you were kissing your partner and opening your lips slightly. You should leave a slight amount of moisture that dries up in a few seconds. If you see more than this, or leave a big wet circle on your hand, you've overdone it--dial it back.

      "content": "Keep your arms busy. You rarely, maybe never, see a great kiss in which the participants just let their arms dangle at their sides. At the very least, embrace your partner and gently pull him or her towards you. You can also run your hands through your partner's hair; or caress their back, sides, or other parts of the body. [7] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. Wrapping your arms around your partner can also be a big turn on! Where you put your hands should be determined by the status of your relationship, your desires, and your partner's signals, whether spoken or communicated non-verbally. But if you feel like it, and you think your partner does too, try grabbing their neck or their back of the head. This next part is for the boys - a thing that is a little risky to do if you are not sure if they really want it is touching/grabbing her butt. If you do it successfully - and the success rate is high - then the girl will get turned on, and the kissing can maybe - just maybe - lead to something else, if you know what we mean. But try it though! Highly recommended."

Whether it's fireworks going off behind you (hint: that would be a great moment for a passionate kiss) or people walking by you at the airport (bittersweet, beautiful goodbye, or epic reunion?) you should not let yourself become distracted. If you look around while kissing, your partner is probably going to feel a little rejected and the passion-o-meter will definitely drop. No matter what is happening, keep your focus on the kiss and on your partner and let nothing distract you - nothing should fascinate you more than the sensation of kissing."
