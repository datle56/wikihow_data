      "content": "Remove your skateboard's trucks. Turn your skateboard on its side. Use a pair of pliers to hold 1 of the bolts on 1 of your trucks in place. Insert the tip of a screwdriver into the corresponding screw on the top side of the board. Twist the screwdriver until the screw is completely out. Repeat this 3 more times to remove 1 truck, and then remove the other truck using the same method. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Feed a piece of fishing line through the holes in your deck. Locate the 2 screw holes closest to 1 end of the skateboard deck. Then, cut off 1 foot (0.30 m) or so of fishing line with a pair of scissors. Hold the deck with the underside facing you and feed 1 end of the fishing line through 1 hole. Then, feed it back towards you through the other hole. [2] X Research source The screw holes in your deck are there because they previously allowed screws to hold the deck and trucks together."

      "content": "Tie a knot with the ends of the fishing line. Fishing line can be slippery, so make sure to tie a knot that will hold, such as a granny knot. Don't tie it too close to the holes in the deck, but instead provide a little slack between the knot and the deck to make hanging it easier. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Hammer a nail into the wall and hook the fishing line on it. Hold a nail against a point on your wall where you'd like the top of the deck to be located. Then, use a hammer to carefully hammer the nail into the wall. [4] X Research source Stop once the head of the nail is almost, but not quite, flush against the wall. Hang the fishing line on the nail between the nail head and the wall. If you're hanging multiple skateboard decks, you may want to use measuring tape and a pencil to find out where on the wall the boards should be hung in order to be evenly spaced out. After measuring your ideal height, measure the width of your skateboard to hang on wall. Plot the figures on the markings you made, and don’t forget to leave around a 2″ gap between to keep the skateboards from looking congested."

      "content": "Hang the fishing line from wall hooks to avoid making holes. Instead of hammering a nail into the wall after you've tied a knot in the fishing line, use a pencil to draw a horizontal line on the wall that's level with the floor where you'd like your skateboard to be hung. Press a command hook, or something similar, onto the center of the line. Then, hang your fishing line on the hook. [5] X Research source If you can't make holes in your walls, this may be a great alternative."

Then, insert a plastic wall anchor into the hole to ensure that it effectively holds the weight of the deck.

Opt for a rope that's at least 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) in diameter for best results. Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure about 25 inches (64 cm) and use a sharp knife to cut the rope at this point.
