      "content": "Decide on what validation level you need. SSL certificates have three validation levels. They are as follows: Domain Validation (DV): This is the cheapest form of validation. It only certifies that the company has control over the domain. This is good for small businesses or blogs that don't exchange private information. Organization Validation (OV): THis is a medium level organization. It verifies that the company has control over the domain and additional company details, such as the name and address. This is good for companies that have websites with forms and lead-capture features. Extended Validation (EV): This is the highest and most expensive level of validation. This verifies company control over the domain, as well as location and legal existence. This is good if your website is handling sensitive information, such as financial and credit card information."

It cannot be used to validate any additional domains or subdomains. Wildcard: Wildcard certificates can provide validation for a single domain as well as any subdomains under that domain. It cannot provide validation for additional domains. Multi-Domain: This type of SSL can provide validation for up to 100 domains using a single SSL certificate."
