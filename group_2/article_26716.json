      "content": "Get a good night's rest. From the ages of 9-13, you need about 8-10 hours of sleep every night. [1] X Research source For ages above 18, the required hours drop down to 7 to 9. The exact amount varies for each person, but one good rule of thumb is that you'll know you've gotten enough sleep if you wake up feeling refreshed. If someone has to wake you and you feel exhausted and grouchy, you probably didn't get enough sleep. If you have to get up at 6 a.m. for school, you should go to bed no later than 9:30 or 10:00. the night before. Your friends might stay up later, but you do most of your growing and brain development while you sleep, so don't sell yourself short by staying up late.

      "content": "Use the bathroom. This one might seem like a no-brainer, but it's important to empty your bladder first thing in the morning before you move on to other activities. Holding a full bladder too long can cause a bladder infection, which is very painful. [3] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Be sure that you wipe thoroughly. Wipe from front to back, never from back to front. This is because the germs from poop are sometimes left behind on your anus, and if you wipe from back to front they can transfer to your vagina and cause an infection."

      "title": "Wash your face.",
      "content": "Wash your face. Some young tweens may not need to wash their faces, but as you get older, your face will start to produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum can make your face shiny and greasy, and often comes with the development of acne, both of which are caused by changing hormones. [4] X Research source This is a normal part of puberty, but requires an extra step in your daily routine to help care for your face. Use a mild facial cleanser. If you have acne, you can use a face wash that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, which can help get rid of your pimples. [5] X Research source Use a gentle moisturizer with at least an SPF 30 to protect your skin from sun damage and to replenish the moisture lost when you wash."

      "title": "Apply deodorant.",
      "content": "Apply deodorant. As you get older, your hormone changes will cause your sweat to become smellier than it was when you were younger. If you feel concerned about the smell, you can apply a deodorant, which masks the smell of sweat, or an antiperspirant, which stops you from sweating as much from your armpits. [6] X Research source Consider starting with a mild, natural deodorant such as Tom's of Maine, and if that doesn't seem to provide the protection you want, try an antiperspirant."

Sometimes tween girls feel a lot of pressure to dress like their closest friends, or even to dress like older girls. You should wear whatever makes you feel happy and comfortable, and try not to worry about what other people choose to do. Any friends who pressure you to dress a certain way or look a certain way are not good friends. That's called peer pressure, and you don't need those kinds of friends in your life. True friends love you the way you are. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide if you want to apply make-up. At this age, it is common for many girls to begin experimenting with a little make-up, but you don't need to if you don't want to or if you don't have time. Make-up is just for fun. Talk to your parents before wearing make-up. Many parents prefer for their daughters to wait until a certain age before wearing make-up, and some parents make a rule that tweens shouldn't wear make-up to school. If you do have your parents' OK to wear make-up, just use a little at first. Learning how to properly apply make-up so that it looks natural takes time. Start with one or two things, like lip gloss and blush. After a few weeks, you might add a little skin-toned eye shadow with a bit of shimmer. You don't need to wear a full face of makeup, and besides, using a bunch of foundation and concealer can clog your pores and make your skin break out in a rash. Instead of foundation, use a healthy BB cream. Reader Poll: We asked 1202 wikiHow readers if they believe that makeup is required to look great, and 66% of them said no . [Take Poll] You heard it here firstâ€”even though makeup can make you feel and look awesome, you can also be a stunner with just your natural beauty."

Brushing also reduces your risk for cavities and keeps your smile fresh and shiny. At your age, you are probably still losing some of your baby teeth, but most of your teeth are permanent adult teeth. It's important to care for these teeth to prevent decay and cavities. Use a fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush. You should spend about 3 minutes total brushing your teeth: be sure to get every surface of every tooth. [10] X Research source"

The United States Department of Agriculture has made it easy to plan a healthy meal using a plate. Half of your plate should be fruits and vegetables and the other half should be grains and protein. Have a glass of milk or a serving of cheese or yogurt on the side. [16] X Trustworthy Source USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion U.S. agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research Go to source Avoid soda and other sugary drinks. Water or milk provides the nutrition you need without unhealthy additives and sugar. Also, watch out for salt; most Americans consume way too much of it, and it can be dangerous for your heart.

Consider helping your parents prepare dinner.

If your family has a cookbook, ask your mom or dad if you can choose a few meals and help prepare them each week."

Your period is a normal part of growing up for girls, but it can take some getting used to as you adjust your daily routine to incorporate menstrual hygiene. Most people start their period around age 12, but some start much sooner or later. Donâ€™t worry if you are the first-- or last-- of your friends to get your period. Some signs that your period will start soon include breast budding (when your breasts first start to fill out and you start needing to wear a bra), armpit hair, and pubic hair. When these things happen, your period will likely follow within a few months.

Otherwise, the blood will stain your underwear and pants and might get on your chair. You have to change the pads regularly to avoid leaking and to stay clean and fresh. Some people prefer to use tampons, which are inserted into the vagina to absorb blood. The first day of a period is usually the heaviest, and it is followed by lighter days of bleeding. You might bleed a lot or a little, or even just \"spot\" or experience little drops of blood, especially for the first few months of your period. [20] X Research source How much or how little blood comes out is called your \"flow.\" How often you need to change your pad depends on how heavy your flow is. You might be most comfortable changing it every hour or two until you get used to your flow and know what to expect. The first time you start menstruating, you might not be prepared with a pad. If it happens at school, go see your school nurse or talk to any female teacher or school employee. Otherwise, tell your parent or caregiver, and they will make sure you get the supplies you need."
