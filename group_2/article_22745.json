      "content": "Hold the crochet hook in your dominant hand. You can grip the crochet hook like you would hold a dinner knife, so that you are holding the body of the hook in your fist with the hook and about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the body extending past your index finger and thumb. Or, you can hold the hook like a pencil, so that only your index finger and thumb are gripping the body about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the hook and the body is resting against your middle finger. Try both options and see what feels the most natural to you. [1] X Research source Having a crochet hook in your hand before you figure out how to hold the yarn may help you to figure out what yarn hold is most helpful for you."

      "title": "Use your non-dominant hand to hold the yarn.",
      "content": "Use your non-dominant hand to hold the yarn. For example, if you are left handed, use your right hand to hold the yarn. If you are right handed, hold the yarn with your left hand. [2] X Research source The basic hold will be the same regardless of which hand you are using to hold your yarn. A lot of people hold the crochet hook in their right hand and the yarn in their left hand. [3] X Expert Source Sarah Stearns DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 4 October 2021."

      "title": "Flatten your palm and straighten your fingers.",
      "content": "Flatten your palm and straighten your fingers. Your fingers should be spread out slightly so that you can easily feed the yarn in between a couple of them. There should be about 0.25 to 0.5 inches (0.64 to 1.27 cm) between your fingertips. [4] X Research source You can curve your fingers after you get the yarn positioned between them if this feels more natural to you."

      "title": "Thread the yarn between your pinkie and ring finger.",
      "content": "Thread the yarn between your pinkie and ring finger. Grasp the end of the yarn with the index finger and thumb of your dominant hand. Bring the strand up between your pinkie and ring finger from below your hand. [5] X Research source Some people prefer to thread the yarn between their ring finger and middle finger instead of their pinkie and ring finger. Use the option that feels most comfortable to you. You can also thread the yarn over your pinky finger, under your ring and middle fingers, and over your index finger.

      "title": "Bring the yarn across the top of your hand.",
      "content": "Bring the yarn across the top of your hand. Keep pulling the strand to bring it across the top of your hand. Pull it so that there are at least 6 inches (15 cm) of yarn extending past the edge of your index finger. [7] X Research source You can also work with the yarn closer to your hand if you prefer, such as by crocheting with the yarn about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) from your index finger."

      "title": "Spread your fingers for less tension and close them for more tension.",
      "content": "Spread your fingers for less tension and close them for more tension. As you crochet, keep in mind that you can spread your fingers to provide more slack in your working yarn, or you can close them to create more tension. Open and close your fingers as needed to loosen and tighten your hold on the working yarn. [8] X Research source Usually, you'll want to hold the yarn tight enough to maintain tension, but loose enough that it can still slide through your fingers while you crochet. [9] X Expert Source Sarah Stearns DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 4 October 2021. Some patterns will specify when more or less tension is needed. For example, you might be instructed to make a loose chain or to create a tight single crochet border."

      "title": "Grip the yarn with your index finger and thumb for more control.",
      "content": "Grip the yarn with your index finger and thumb for more control. Press the yarn between your thumb and index finger to hold it and control the tension of the yarn as you work with it. Tighten your grip to increase the tension, and loosen your grip to decrease the tension. [10] X Research source You can also skip this part of the hold if you prefer. You may find it easier to have the yarn dangling free rather than between your index finger and thumb."

      "title": "Wrap the yarn around your pinkie finger 1 time for extra security.",
      "content": "Wrap the yarn around your pinkie finger 1 time for extra security. Wrap the yarn starting from under your hand going up between your pinkie and ring finger. Then, bring the yarn over the top of your pinkie towards the outer edge of your pinkie finger and back up between your pinkie and ring finger again before completing the basic hold. [11] X Research source This will make your hold on the yarn a little more secure, and it will also help you to achieve more tension if needed."

    {
      "title": "Increase the tension by wrapping the yarn around your index finger.",
      "content": "Increase the tension by wrapping the yarn around your index finger. Do the basic yarn hold, but after you bring the yarn down over the edge of your index finger, bring it under and up between your index finger and middle finger. Then, bring the yarn across the top of your index finger again to complete the hold. [12] X Research source Do not wrap the yarn around your finger too tightly. It should be snug against your finger, but not so tight that it is uncomfortable or cutting off your circulation!"
