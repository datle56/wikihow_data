      "title": "Pale, flawless skin",
      "content": "Pale, flawless skin Koreans prioritize clear, smooth, and hydrated skin that has a “glass-like” radiance. They take their skincare routines very seriously, often involving 10 steps or more, from double cleansing to applying serums, ampoules, and sheet masks. Pale skin is also desired for historical and cultural reasons. In the past, people with lighter skin were considered wealthier and of higher social status because they didn’t have to work outside in the sun.

Cleanser , toner , essence , serum , ampoule , sheet mask , eye cream , moisturizer , sunscreen and makeup remover Many Koreans get regular facials because they’re so accessible and affordable. In America, it’s difficult to find a facial that’s under $100, while prices are usually between $30-70 in Korea. [2] X Research source To get pale skin , some Koreans receive glutathione injections (also known as the Cinderella injection). Glutathione inhibits melanin production, leading to a lighter and more even complexion.

In Korea and other Asian countries, people believe emphasizing it makes you look cute, innocent, and youthful. K-pop idols and K-drama actors often use makeup to highlight their aegyo sal, creating the appearance of bigger and brighter eyes.

      "content": "Straight eyebrows In Korea, having straight eyebrows is a desirable feature because it creates a youthful and innocent look. [5] X Research source Straight eyebrows can also help your eyes look bigger, which is one of the top Korean beauty standards.

      "title": "Plump lips",
      "content": "Plump lips In the past, thin lips were the beauty standard in Korea, but full lips are considered the most beautiful according to current standards. A small mouth, a defined Cupid’s bow, and a pouty lower lip are highly admired, and the corners of the lip should be slightly upturned (so it looks like you’re always smiling). [6] X Research source Examples of Korean celebs with plump lips: Jang Won-young, Lee Hye-in, Han Ye-seul You can use a lip plumper to increase the size of your lips. Alternatively, apply a darker lip color toward the center of your lips, then use your fingers to blend the color outward, creating a subtle gradient. Top with your favorite lip gloss to create the illusion of fuller lips."

      "title": "Double eyelids",
      "content": "Double eyelids In Korea, double eyelids (eyelids with visible creases where your eye meets your eye socket) are considered beautiful because they’re associated with a more “awake” and expressive appearance. Double eyelid surgery (also known as blepharoplasty) is one of the most common surgical procedures in the country, especially among young adults, who often undergo it as they start college or enter the workforce. [7] X Research source Examples of Korean celebs with double eyelids: Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Jisoo, Im Yoon-ah Since most companies require job applicants to submit a photo as part of the hiring process, many Koreans feel pressured to get double eyelid surgery (and other procedures) to improve their career prospects.

      "title": "Small nose with high bridge",
      "content": "Small nose with high bridge The ideal Korean face has a high nose bridge, which is when the bone structure between the eyes is more elevated and pronounced, making the nose appear more sharp and angular. A low nose bridge, on the other hand, means the bridge of the nose is flatter and sits closer to the cheeks and eyes. For Korean men and women, a high nose bridge is considered beautiful because it’s believed to enhance facial harmony and create a more elegant appearance. [9] X Research source Examples of Korean celebs with high nose bridges: Min Hyo-rin, Kim Tae-Hee, Han Ga-in It’s common to achieve a high nose bridge through rhinoplasty, where a surgeon can use implants or cartilage grafts to raise the nasal bridge. Alternatively, dermal filler is a less invasive option to add volume to the bridge area, though it is temporary. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Rounded “V-line” face shape The ideal Korean face shape is a slender and oval one, with a defined jawline and V-shaped chin. This face shape gives you a cute and delicate look, which is associated with youthfulness and beauty. Many Koreans achieve this V-shape through facial massages, thread lifts, Botox, or facial contouring surgery (also known as mandibuloplasty). [11] X Research source Examples of Korean celebs with V-shape faces: Hyomin, Kim Jennie, Seo Yea-ji, Moon Byul Other non-invasive methods, like face contouring injections, chin enhancement fillers, and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) face lifting, can be used to achieve the V-shape.

      "content": "Lifted smile Also known as the corner lip lift surgery, the smile lift surgery is a popular procedure that reshapes the lip corners and lifts the mouth corners. A surgeon will make incisions at the upper outer and bottom outer corners of your lips, relocate the muscles that lift the edges of your mouth, and then weaken your DAO muscles (muscles responsible for lowering the corners of your mouth). This operation creates a youthful look that makes it seem like you’re always softly smiling.

      "content": "Absence of wrinkles While aging is a natural (and unavoidable) process, many Koreans start looking into procedures to correct fine lines and wrinkles in their late 30s. This includes less invasive procedures, like thread lifts, mini face lifts, and Botox, but wrinkle removal surgery also includes more invasive procedures like forehead lifts and neck lifts. These are widely available at specialized clinics in Seoul, especially in the Gangnam district. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Slim body shape Koreans prefer slim and toned bodies, with many participating in diets to meet “ideal” weight standards. The “ideal weight” can be calculated by taking your height in centimeters and then subtracting 120. [15] X Research source With that being said, this isn’t a healthy or accurate way to determine a healthy weight, and it can lead to body image issues. Examples of Korean celebs with slim bodies: Kim Seol-hyun, Hyun Bin, Park Seo-joon, Shin Yu-na Korean men also prefer a more androgynous and “boyish” look, instead of a “ripped” or muscular appearance. It’s possible to achieve the ideal body shape through liposuction, fat burning injections, and diet pills. However, all of these methods can lead to serious health problems. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Many Korean beauty standards come from Confucian philosophy. During the Joseon dynasty, Confucianism emphasized modesty, humility, and respect for tradition, so beauty was often associated with qualities like virtue and purity. White, flawless skin, rosy lips and cheeks, and charcoal-black hair were highly valued because they symbolized natural beauty and elegance. [19] X Research source During the Japanese colonization, Western and Japanese beauty standards began to influence Korea. Imported beauty products and bolder hair and makeup looks became more prominent. [20] X Research source After the Korean War, U.S. military surgeons were sent to South Korea to perform reconstructive surgeries. This popularized plastic surgery, especially blepharoplasty, as surgeons focused on procedures to make Koreans look more Westernized. [21] X Research source Today, the K-pop and K-drama industries have the biggest influence on Korean beauty standards. Idols and actresses have popularized having double eyelids, pointed noses, flawless skin, V-shape faces, plump lips, and slim bodies."

      "content": "Koreans prioritize youth, while Americans prefer a mature and striking look. While there is debate on whether Western beauty standards have influenced Korean beauty standards, Koreans prefer a more delicate and natural appearance, with heavy emphasis on preventative and anti-aging skincare. Americans, on the other hand, celebrate a variety of makeup looks and styles, which reflect the country’s multicultural background. Here are some other common differences between American and Korean beauty standards: [22] X Research source Body shape: Koreans prefer slim figures, while Americans embrace curvier, hourglass figures. Skin: Koreans prefer pale skin that is “glass-like,” while Americans embrace a wide range of skin tones. Facial features: Koreans prefer soft and delicate features, while Americans tend to admire strong and sharp features."

      "content": "Koreans have high beauty standards, which can be unrealistic and unhealthy. While it depends on the individual person, Korean beauty standards can be toxic because there’s an immense pressure to look “perfect.” Lookism in Korea is a major issue, especially since your physical appearance can determine your career, success, and marriage prospects. Since cosmetic procedures are so normalized in the country, people who choose not to get surgery (or those who cannot afford it) may feel inadequate or at a disadvantage in society.
