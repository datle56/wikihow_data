      "title": "Buy some memory foam.",
      "content": "Buy some memory foam. If you can't find any, or if it is too expensive, you can also buy a memory foam pillow. However, know that if you buy a memory foam pillow, you will have to deal with the little holes in the memory foam that let you breathe. If you bought a memory foam pillow as your source of memory foam, remove the pillowcase and cut off the rest of the layers until you reach memory foam. Be careful not to cut the memory foam when doing this."

      "title": "Cut out a chunk of memory foam.",
      "content": "Cut out a chunk of memory foam. Use scissors to cut a piece the size you desire your squishy to be. Make sure you are using sharp scissors and not dull ones because it can be difficult to cut through pieces of memory foam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a rough outline of your squishy.",
      "content": "Make a rough outline of your squishy. For example, if you are making a star, you would want to cut out some big triangle-shaped chunks of foam until it more or less looks like an uneven star shape. Remember that it doesn't have to be perfect, but you should at least have some idea of the shape of your squishy. Don't make any details yet. It should look rough and uneven."
    },
    {
      "title": "Refine the squishy's shape.",
      "content": "Refine the squishy's shape. Use your scissors to carefully snip parts off of the memory foam piece to create the exact shape you'd like for your squishy. For the star example, you would take the time to make sure it is all even smoother and that the points are all more or less perfect triangles. This step may take longer if you are making a complex shape. Do not rush this part, or you may accidentally snip off too much. Remember, you can always snip off a bit more, but you can't put anything back."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smooth out any extra bumps and angles.",
      "content": "Smooth out any extra bumps and angles. This step is optional, but if you want your squishy to be extra smooth with nice, even rounded edges, check its shape and smooth out the rough edges. For example, with the star squishy, you could smooth out all the edges on the points. You don't have to smoothen any curves or angles, but it does help to make it look much more squishy and soft. Remember that when smoothing out curves, the more little cuts you give it, the nicer it will look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. Two ways you can color your squishy are painting and using felt markers. If you are using paint, mix any colors you will need together beforehand to make it easier when painting your squishy. You should also set up a bunch of paintbrushes and some water to switch colors. If you're using felt markers, have your desired colors handy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Paint your squishy using acrylic paint.",
      "content": "Paint your squishy using acrylic paint. If you are making a specific object, you can either paint it like the object is in real life, like painting a star yellow or white, or make it abstract, like painting the star rainbow. Paint the squishy in any way you'd like. You can add patterns, solid colors, or designs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use felt markers to color your squishy.",
      "content": "Use felt markers to color your squishy. Note that felt markers will not color very evenly, but they are still useable. It is recommended that you use these for small details, like smiley faces, sprinkles, etc., instead of for coloring in a large area of space."

    {
      "title": "Finish up any last details.",
      "content": "Finish up any last details. Outline the eyes, draw on a little mouth, or do anything you'd like to make your squishy look as detailed as possible. Feel free to use materials such as Sharpies or felt markers to do so."

      "content": "Play with your squishy. You can now share it with your friends, keep it for yourself, or give it as a gift. No matter what you choose to do with it, this cute little squishy is sure to put a smile on your face."
