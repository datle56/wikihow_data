It’s a lot easier to clean if you do it right away, instead of putting it off for later, explains residential and commercial cleaning expert Arturo Perez. “If you spill something, clean that. If something is not in its place, pick that up. Basically, clean up after yourself. That’s the best way to keep your house clean,” he says. [1] X Expert Source Arturo Perez Residential & Commercial Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 22 March 2023. Get in the habit of putting things back the way they're supposed to be after you're done with them.

It really only takes a couple of minutes every morning to make your bed , and once you get in the habit of it, you won't miss the time. [3] X Research source Making your bed every morning has a motivating effect as well. If you start your day by making your bed, that's one task that you've already successfully completed, which puts you in the frame of mind to complete other tasks as well. [4] X Research source"

This shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes and can easily be done while you're doing something else, like watching TV or listening to music. If you wipe off flat surfaces every day, your home will look a lot cleaner, and dust and grime won't accumulate. [5] X Research source Get in the habit of wiping things off as soon as you use them. For example, after you've cleared the dishes from dinner, take a second to wipe down the table, rather than saving that task for later."

      "content": "Take 5 minutes each day to sweep around doors and hallways. The areas where people walk the most are going to get the most dirt. Sweeping every day keeps this dirt from building up and ensures no one will track it through the rest of the house. [7] X Research source When sweeping, “always use smaller, shorter strokes,” recommends house cleaning professional Guy Peters. “Not only will these be more precise, but they also won’t make a mess in the process of sweeping. Trying to go too quickly with big strokes will end up pushing dust and debris around the room.” [8] X Expert Source Guy Peters House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 12 July 2021. You might want to consider sweeping the porch or entryway outside your door as well. This limits the amount of outside dirt and debris people bring inside with them."

You may find it helpful to use a small box or basket to gather up everything at once, so you don’t need to make several trips back and forth.

This process shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, but it can do wonders for the cleanliness of your home. If you have housemates that are on different schedules, give the kitchen closing duties to whoever is the last person to use it. If you have a dishwasher, try to run it each night.

You may be tempted to save all your laundry for one big weekly laundry day, but as the dirty clothes overflow their hampers, your home will start to look cluttered and untidy. You’ll also be stuck spending a whole day doing all your laundry loads, which is stressful and inconvenient, explains professional organizer Marty Stevens-Heebner. Instead, she recommends spreading out your loads of laundry over the course of the week. [15] X Expert Source Marty Stevens-Heebner, SMM-C, CPO® Certified Professional Organizer & Senior Move Manager Expert Interview. 14 January 2020. For example, you might go around and collect all the dark clothing from your hampers each Friday evening and wash them . Then, on Saturday morning you could collect and wash the lights , and on Sunday you could tackle your towels and linens. “The idea is to have a system, and to break it down in bits and parts so it doesn’t seem overwhelming,” says Stevens-Heebner.

[17] X Research source Accumulated dust can affect the air quality in your home and make it more difficult to breathe, so this task is as much for your health as it is for the sake of cleanliness. [18] X Research source If you’d like, you can spread out the dusting over the course of the week, instead of doing it all in one day. For example, you might dust your bedroom on Monday, the living room on Tuesday, and the kitchen on Wednesday."

      "content": "Keep a single donation box for things you no longer use. Getting rid of clothes and objects you don’t use frees up more space in your home and helps you keep your space clutter-free. If you have a hall closet, that's a good place to put your donation box. If space is tight, you can also hang a bag on a hook inside a closet door. Clearly label your box or bag for donations, and put things into it as you go. When the box is full, take it to your favorite donation center. [21] X Research source This is also helpful if you have children. As soon as a child grows out of something, put it straight into the donation box so you don't have to worry about it anymore. If you get in the habit of putting things into the box regularly, your closets and storage areas will always look neater, and you won't have to tackle the hours-long task of sorting through things once or twice a year."

Laundry is likely to pile up in a corner of a room or on the floor of the bathroom if the laundry hamper isn’t easily accessible, and this makes your home appear more cluttered. To avoid this, make sure there's at least one hamper for each person in your household, and that they're all conveniently located. [23] X Research source If you're not sure where to put the hamper, look at where the laundry typically piles up. If you place a hamper there, you’ll still be able to toss your clothes into that spot when you take them off, but it will look much neater!"

      "content": "You can place them in a plastic bin, a drawer, or a closet. This makes it easier to clean things up immediately because you won't have to go around hunting your house for what you need. For example, put bathroom cleaners in every bathroom, disinfectants and multi-purpose cleaners in all rooms, and kitchen cleaners in the kitchen. [24] X Research source While this might mean that you have to buy several bottles of the same cleaning products, they'll last a lot longer because you're not using them all over the house. Sure, you'll spend a little more initially, but it'll even out. If it isn't feasible for you to have multiple brooms or vacuum cleaners, put these tools in a central location where they can be easily accessed from the entire home. If your home has two floors, though, it's still worth it to spring for one upstairs and one downstairs so you don't have to lug them back and forth."
