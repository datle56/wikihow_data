      "content": "Choose a lip color that will accentuate your eyes. Eye makeup isn’t the only method of bringing out the color in your eyes. Choosing a lip color, whether it be lipstick, lip stain, or a gloss, can also help your eyes pop. While you don’t want to overpower your eyes with a very bold lipstick, you can still accentuate them. For example, try choosing colors that are complementary to your eyeshadow. Generally, berry colors (such as coral, pink, or red) offer good, but subtle choices. One example of a bad color pairing would be to choose a very dark berry color for your lips, and then pairing it with a green eyeshadow."

If you are nervous about dying your hair, try using a semi-permanent color that doesn't last as long as permanent color, or you could even try on a wig in the color you are thinking of to get an idea of how it will react with your skin and eye color."
