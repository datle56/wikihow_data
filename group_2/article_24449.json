      "content": "Aquarius prioritizes friendship while Capricorn looks for stability. Capricorn might be frustrated because they can’t tell if they’re in the friend zone or if they’re dating Aquarius. This is because Aquarius loves being surrounded by friends and they’re hesitant to commit to a relationship, so they tend to blur the line between friendship and a romantic relationship. Compatibility tip: If a Capricorn really wants to make the relationship work, they should be casual and avoid pressuring Aquarius to follow rules in the relationship. Aquarius can be clear with Capricorn about how they feel. This might mean stepping out of their comfort zone, but Capricorn will appreciate knowing where they stand."

      "content": "These two have different sexual appetites. Aquarius tends to be spontaneous in the bedroom—they’ll be the one to suggest a quickie before work. Capricorn, however, would rather take their time and have a completely sensual experience. Compatibility tip: Their sex life can improve if Capricorn makes an effort to be a bit more surprising in the bedroom. They have to show Aquarius that they need them sexually. On the other hand, Aquarius should occasionally slow down and appreciate Capricorn’s sensual side."

      "title": "Aquarius and Capricorn aren't the most emotionally intuitive signs.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Capricorn aren't the most emotionally intuitive signs. Aquarius has a bit of a reputation for being reserved or standoffish. This is probably because they're more analytical—they're thinking rather than expressing. Capricorns are a bit more in touch with their feelings although they dislike feeling vulnerable. They try to keep their emotional side to themselves. Compatibility Tip: These two can help each other. Even though Capricorn isn't a very intuitive sign, they encourage Aquarius to be more in touch with their feelings. Aquarius inspires Capricorn to be calm and objective—emotions are just another issue to think about, not be afraid of."

      "content": "Aquarius and Capricorn have different personalities, but they work together well. At first glance, these signs don't have much in common, but if they can appreciate each other's unique personalities, the relationship can thrive. Aquarius might value Capricorn's problem-solving abilities, especially if it helps them turn an idea into reality. Capricorn can appreciate Aquarius's altruistic and lighthearted nature. Since they have different ways of expressing themselves, both sides have to take this into account. Aquarius should remember that Capricorn is a bit more traditional and action-oriented while Capricorn needs to understand that Aquarius is more free-thinking and driven by concepts."
