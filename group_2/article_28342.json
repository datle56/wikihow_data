If so, then he may want you back; if he just wants to keep you in the “friend zone,” then he won't act affectionate or loving towards you. Check out his social media profile(s) or try to find out if he's seeing someone from mutual friends without being too obvious about it. He may be seeing someone else and is just talking to you to be nice or because he wants to be friends. “Some pretty practical signs that your ex is missing you include peeking at your social media or liking your posts, which shows that they're still keeping tabs on your life and how you spend your time,” notes dating coach Erika Kaplan.

Shield goes on to say that these couples may be unaware that “they're not having a functional relationship between them; how they relate to each other isn't working. That's what needs to change—they need to learn how to interact better, how to listen, how to communicate, and how to have boundaries, so it's not about just getting them back.” [17] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 11 March 2021."
