      "content": "Apply lemon to your skin. Lemon juice is one of the best-known and most effective lightening and bleaching ingredients. Many use lemon to lighten hair, but it also is effective in lightening the tone of your skin. To prepare the lemon juice, squeeze several small lemons into a small bowl. Prepare your skin by washing your face and any other parts of your body that you wish to be paler with a gentle face or body wash. Apply the lemon juice to your face or other parts of your body by brushing on the lemon juice with a large clean brush or by dabbing the mixture on with a paper towel. Let the lemon juice sit on your skin for 20 minutes, then wash it off with cool water. For an especially effective lightener, keep the lemon juice on overnight and then wash it off in the morning."

      "content": "Make a tomato mask. Tomato is also a natural lightening agent that has several other health benefits, among which is the reduction of oil production to prevent acne. To create a tomato mask, mash a tomato in a large bowl with a potato masher until it is a pulpy liquid, then squeeze the juice of one lemon into the tomato mixture and stir. Wash your face and/or body with a gentle face or body wash and pat them dry. Then use a pastry brush or paper towel to apply a layer of the tomato honey mixture on your skin. Wait a few minutes until the layer is dry, then apply another layer of the pulp. Leave the mask on for 20 minutes, then wash it off with cool water. Tomato is a very mild ingredient, so you can use this mask multiple times a week."

      "content": "Up your intake of Vitamin C. Among its many benefits, Vitamin C helps to brighten your skin and keep it healthy. Vitamin C battles free radicals that can age and darken skin pigmentation, and it also helps to get rid of dead skin cells to expose the lighter and brighter skin cells below. [2] X Research source Foods rich in Vitamin C include strawberries, tomatoes, cantaloupes, green peas and sweet peppers. Getting more Vitamin C every day won’t make as big of an impact on your skin as regularly applying skin masks, but it will make a difference over time and has numerous other health benefits."

      "content": "Drink enough water. Drinking water helps to flush out your skin to brighten and renew it. It can also rejuvenate your skin after getting a tan so that the pigmented layer of skin fades faster. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water a day to keep your skin radiant and healthy. [3] X Research source Don't drink all eight glasses in one sitting. Pace yourself throughout the day. If it is a hot day, or if you are working out a lot, you may want to drink more water to replace whatever your body loses during the day."

      "content": "Limit your time in the sun. The best way to become paler is also the most intuitive: limiting your time in the sun to protect your skin and avoid tanning. Instead of all together avoiding going outside on sunny days, instead try to spend your time in the shade, or else wear protective clothing like sunglasses and a sunhat if you are going to be in direct sunlight. [4] X Research source Don’t completely avoid the sun. Sunlight is a vital source of Vitamin D, which has numerous and invaluable health benefits. A good 10-20 minutes in the sun (wearing sunblock) is enough to get your daily dose of Vitamin D."

      "content": "Wear sunscreen every day. In addition to avoiding direct sunlight, wearing sunscreen is also an essential part of protecting your skin from the sun. Wear at least SPF 30, preferably a formula that contain zinc and titanium dioxide, which directly block both UVA and UVB rays and begin working as soon as you put them on your skin. Since sunscreen is white, it may also you’re your skin look paler, even when it is completely rubbed in. [5] X Research source Wear sunblock every day on your face and any other parts of your body that will be exposed to the sun. Use water-resistant sunblock if you are going to be swimming. While you are in direct sunlight, reapply sunblock every two hours. To apply sunblock, use at least a quarter-sized amount on your face and any other exposed parts of your body. Rub the sunblock fully into your skin to ensure that it will work properly.

      "title": "Wash and exfoliate your skin regularly.",
      "content": "Wash and exfoliate your skin regularly. Another important way to promote pale and luminous skin is to wash your face in the morning and before bed. Washing your face properly and consistently removes oil and dirt from the surface of your skin, making your complexion lighter and more radiant. Try to use a face wash with lemon or Aloe Vera extract, which both have deep cleansing properties. Once a week, use an exfoliating face wash along with a textured cloth or a loofa. Gently scrub your skin in circular motions to remove excess dead and dry skin cells from the surface of your skin. Don’t exfoliate more than once a week, as it can be harsh on your skin to over-exfoliate. [7] X Expert Source Alicia Ramos Skincare Professional Expert Interview. 12 June 2019. Moisturize your face every time after washing it, making sure to use a sheer moisturizer rather than a tinted moisturizer. Apply sunblock after using moisturizer, or use a moisturizing sunblock that is at least SPF 30."

      "content": "Wear dark clothing. An easy way to make yourself appear paler is to wear black clothing or other dark colors. Dark clothing creates contrast so that your skin looks lighter by comparison. It’s an easy way to instantly look paler and more dramatic. This does not mean that you have to dress up like a goth. You can create a casual appearance by pairing a black shirt with blue jeans. You don't have to wear all black. Put the focus on your shirt, as this is where you will have the most skin exposed (neck, arms, face, etc.)."

      "content": "Dye your hair a dark color. If you are willing to dramatically change your appearance, dying your hair a dark brown or black, or even a deep maroon or purple, will make your skin look paler. Because your hair frames your face, a dark hair color provides the perfect backdrop to make your face look paler by comparison. [9] X Research source If you don't want to dye your hair, consider getting a wig instead. This is great for a temporary look. Keep in mind that hair dye is permanent. Even if you use temporary dye, there is a chance that it might stain your hair, especially if it is blonde."

      "content": "Wear dark contacts. It's well known that wearing black or brown eyeliner helps to emphasize eye and skin contrast, but if you don’t want to wear makeup, wearing colored contacts can also be a good solution. If you have blue eyes, consider wearing brown contact lenses to heighten contrast and make your skin appear paler. If you already have to wear contacts, consider getting prescription contacts instead. Be sure to practice proper hygiene when wearing contacts . Never leave them in overnight."
