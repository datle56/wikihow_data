      "content": "Brush your dog. Brushing is important for all dogs, but especially for poodles. Poodle hair can easily get matted together as the dog sheds, and for this reason, it is often recommended that poodles with long hair be brushed every day. Brushing once or twice every week is generally acceptable if the dog has shorter hair. Start brushing at the poodle’s neck and move down toward the tail. Use a slicker brush to gently remove thick tangles and mats."

      "content": "Remove thick mats or tangles with scissors. Mats or tangles that won’t brush out should be carefully cut out with scissors. It's important to remove mats whenever you find them, as they can pull at the skin, causing discomfort to your pet. Because of the way they shed their hair, poodles are prone to matting if they go for long periods without grooming. In extreme cases, matting can cause skin infections that are painful for your pet."

      "content": "Prepare a bath. It’s important to bathe your dog, especially if he has gotten dirty while playing outdoors. You should be sure to bathe your dog before trimming him with clippers, as dirty or overly oily fur can prematurely dull your clipper blades. But bathing your dog too often can wash away the natural oils that your dog’s coat needs. The ASPCA recommends bathing your dog every three months or so unless more frequent baths are required. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Fill your bathtub with a few inches of water. Remember, it doesn’t need to be full, and your dog will likely splash around quite a bit. You’ll only need the water to be about ankle-deep."

If your dog does not enjoy bathing, you may want to get a helper to aid you in keeping the dog in the tub during the bath. Use a cup or a pitcher to flush water all over your poodle from head to tail. Try to avoid getting water in your poodle’s eyes and ears."

      "content": "Lather shampoo from the poodle’s head to its tail. If you massage your poodle's back while rubbing in the shampoo, he may enjoy the bath a bit more. Use a shampoo specifically made for dogs. Not only does dog shampoo have everything your poodle’s coat needs to remain healthy, but it also avoids ingredients in human shampoo that might be harmful to your pet."

You may want to brush your poodle’s coat again after the bath, then dry with a towel a second time after brushing. Be sure to thoroughly clean and dry your dog’s ears with a towel or clean paper towels. It's important to clean inside and under your dog's ears to prevent bacteria, yeast, and parasites from living there."

      "title": "Brush your poodle’s teeth.",
      "content": "Brush your poodle’s teeth. Use a toothbrush to gently remove plaque buildup around the base of your poodle's teeth. Choose a toothpaste made specifically for dogs. Your poodle will inevitably swallow some of the toothpaste, and human toothpaste can upset your dog's stomach. Brush gently. Remember, your dog may not be used to having its gums rubbed. Brushing too hard or fast can cause pain to your poodle's sensitive gums. Be consistent with your poodle's dental care. Brushing your dog's teeth can help prevent tartar buildup, which causes periodontal disease and can lead to potentially-fatal bacterial infections.

But you also want to avoid trimming them too short, as this can cause bleeding. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source You may be able to trim your dog’s nails with a pair of scissors, but you will likely find it easier if you purchase a specialty tool, like a guillotine trimmer. Don’t cut the quick. This is the part of the nail closest to your dog’s “toes,” and it’s very sensitive and can bleed easily. Ask your veterinarian or a professional groomer to help trim your dog’s nails if you have a hard time doing it at home."

      "content": "Choose a cut for your poodle. There are many different styles and cuts that poodle owners can choose from. Some common cuts are the Puppy Clip, the Continental Clip, and the Bikini Clip. While there are other grooming options, these are the most common. Consult a professional groomer on which cuts would be best for your dog. Remember, if you’re doing most of your dog’s grooming at home, you’ll need to commit to a certain amount of time and effort. Some cuts are easier to style and maintain than others. All of the common styles involve trimming or shaving the poodle’s face, feet, and the base of the tail. The style of the poodle’s body fur changes significantly based on the chosen clip."

      "title": "Invest in good quality clippers and scissors.",
      "content": "Invest in good quality clippers and scissors. Though it may seem tempting to buy a cheaper pair of clippers or scissors, getting a higher-quality product will be better for your dog. Better clippers are less likely to scrape your dog’s skin or pull his fur while cutting. A cordless clipper will make the grooming much easier for you! High-quality clippers such as Laube, Andis, or Oster cost around $125-$175. They should last much longer than their less expensive counterparts. Note that many groomers seem to prefer Andis or Laube over Oster, as Oster clipper blades can heat during trimming. If you do use Oster, you may want to have extra blades of the same size so that you can switch them out if they become heated. Good scissors made for grooming may cost around $50. These scissors should be sharp and comfortable for you to cut with. You may want to try out different models before purchasing them."

      "title": "Use the right blades.",
      "content": "Use the right blades. Clippers have interchangeable blades that are numbered to indicate the length that they will leave the fur after trimming, with higher numbers indicating shorter fur. You will likely need a variety of clipper blades: start with a 5, 7, 10, 15, and 30. If you cannot afford to get many different blades or you’re just starting out, begin with at 10 or 15. Be aware that use of 30 and 40 blades can be quite difficult and should usually be left to experienced or professional groomers. Improper use of these (very short) blades can scrape or burn your poodle’s skin."

This is especially important for a puppy or a poodle who has not been regularly groomed. Over time, your dog should become more and more comfortable being around the clippers. You may want to have a professional groomer clip your poodle the first few times so that you do not have to worry about both introducing your dog to the clippers and learning to clip the fur."

[6] X Research source Use scissors to cut a “visor” line just above the poodle’s eyes. [7] X Research source Use scissors to trim a small arch above the dog’s ears.

The puppy clip is generally done with scissors. Brush your poodle’s fur out neatly, then use scissors to trim the fur at a uniform length along the body and legs. You can do a cut similar to a puppy cut (called a lamb cut) with a very low number clipper blade (such as a 3, 4, or 5). This cut also leaves the fur at a uniform length but may be a bit shorter than a puppy cut due to the use of clippers. [17] X Research source"
