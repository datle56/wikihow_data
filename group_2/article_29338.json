[3] X Research source An individual trust includes only your property, while a joint or shared trust includes all property that belongs to you and your spouse. While you and your spouse can create two individual trusts, this can cause complications with shared assets. A joint trust, however, can dispose of both individual and shared property."

If you have retirement or investment accounts that allow you to designate a beneficiary, leave these out of your trust. Including them or designating your trust as the beneficiary only adds an unnecessary layer of complication.

[10] X Research source Most people choose a spouse or adult child as their successor trustee. You also may want to choose a back-up in case the person you've chosen as a successor has predeceased you or is otherwise unavailable or incapable of taking on the trustee's duties. Talk to the person you choose before you draft your documents, and make sure he or she is able and willing to be your successor trustee. You may want to name an additional alternate successor in case the person you name is unavailable or incapable of acting as trustee. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Bar Association Leading professional organization of lawyers and law students Go to source You can name a bank or trust company to manage your trust after your death as well, but keep in mind there probably will be fees involved. Unlike with a will, your successor trustee doesn't have to live in the same state as you, or the state where your real property is located. For this reason, trusts often are preferred if you want a friend or relative who lives out of state to distribute your property after your death."

[12] X Research source [13] X Research source You also may be able to buy a book or use an online trust preparation service, either of which typically cost less than $100. However, if you hire an attorney to prepare your trust documents for you, expect to pay upwards of $1,000. Keep in mind you can always draft your documents and then have an attorney look over them to make sure you've met your intent. Typically attorneys charge less to review documents than they would to prepare them. Each state has its own requirements for creating a living trust. While most forms will be sufficient, an experienced estate planning attorney licensed in your state will be able to determine immediately if your trust documents meet your state's requirements."

In addition to your personal copy, make sure your successor trustee has his or her own copy, or knows where your copy is located and how to access it.
