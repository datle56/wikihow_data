      "content": "Find an empty plastic bottle. An empty water bottle or liter of soda will work. You can use any size bottle, but keep in mind that the bigger the bottle, the bigger the gravity bong hits will be. If you're smoking alone, a small plastic bottle should work. You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people. Make sure the bottle you use can fit inside a second, larger plastic bottle or a bucket."

      "content": "Take off the cap and cover the mouthpiece with aluminum foil. Don't wrap the aluminum foil around the mouthpiece too tightly. You'll need to take it off later when you're smoking out of the gravity bong. The entire opening should be covered with the aluminum foil. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Poke tiny holes in the aluminum foil over the mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Poke tiny holes in the aluminum foil over the mouthpiece. Use something thin to make the holes, like a toothpick or the end of a paper clip . Don't make too many holes or make the holes too big or the cannabis will fall down into the gravity bong. You just need a few holes so the smoke from the cannabis can travel down into the bottle."

      "title": "Cut the bottom off the empty plastic bottle.",
      "content": "Cut the bottom off the empty plastic bottle. First, gently pierce the bottle with a knife around 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from the bottom. Then, insert a pair of scissors into the slit you made and cut around the bottle in a straight line until the bottom comes off. Set the top of the bottle aside for now and recycle the bottom.

      "title": "Find a bucket or plastic container that's slightly larger than the bottle.",
      "content": "Find a bucket or plastic container that's slightly larger than the bottle. This is the container you'll fill with water. You can also use another plastic bottle that's bigger than the first one. If you do, just cut off the neck of the bottle so the rim is the same width as the body. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill the larger plastic container with water.",
      "content": "Fill the larger plastic container with water. Cold or warm water is fine. You want to fill the container almost all the way up — leave 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) between the top of the water and the rim of the container. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the bottle in the container of water.",
      "content": "Put the bottle in the container of water. The open bottom of the bottle should be at the bottom of the container, and the neck and mouthpiece of the bottle should be at the top above the water. If water is covering the mouthpiece, you're pushing the bottle too far down in the container."

Don't grind it up too much or the pieces could fall through the holes. [5] X Research source Hold the plastic bottle steady with one hand as you're putting the cannabis on the foil so it doesn't fall off."

Don't push down too quickly or you could take in too much smoke. Keep inhaling and pushing down until all the smoke is out of the bottle. If you feel like you can't take in anymore smoke, take your mouth off the bottle."

When you're ready to use your gravity bong again, put the aluminum foil back on, sprinkle more cannabis over it, and repeat! [8] X Research source"
