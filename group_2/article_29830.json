      "title": "Soak the shirt in hot water.",
      "content": "Soak the shirt in hot water. Bring a large pot of water to a boil on the stovetop. Boiling hot water will make the fibers of the shirt contract which will make it shrink smaller. If you're looking to shrink a shirt as much as possible, high heat is the best way to go. Remove the pot from the stove. Submerge the shirt in the hot water. Use a spoon to push the shirt all the way underwater making sure it is completely covered by the water. Soak the shirt for 30 minutes."

      "title": "Wash the shirt in hot water.",
      "content": "Wash the shirt in hot water. Set your washing machine settings to the hottest water possible. Wash the shirt on a regular wash cycle. If you bought a new shirt and want to shrink it before wearing, washing the shirt on hot will tighten the fibers and reduce its size slightly. Hot water may cause some fabrics to bleed or fade, wash the shirt alone to avoid damaging other clothes. The agitation of the washing machine in top load machines will crinkle fabrics and lead to more shrinkage than a front loading machine. Remember that the type of fabric will define how much it will shrink. Cotton usually shrinks by 20% on the first hot water wash, while wool fabrics are more unpredictable."

      "title": "Dry the shirt on high heat.",
      "content": "Dry the shirt on high heat. Place the shirt in the dryer and dry it on the dryer’s hottest setting. The heat will cause the shirt to shrink a little bit. With the exception of wool fibers, the dryer won't shrink clothes as much as hot water tends to. If you only want your shirt to shrink a little bit, wash it in cool water and dry on the highest setting. Heat will shrink synthetic blend fabrics more than pre-shrunk natural fiber clothing. Wool fabrics will felt in the dryer which causes the fabric to bunch and shrink as individual fabrics rub against each other and stick together."
