If you’d like a larger serving or enough for seconds, add 2 cups (16 oz), and so on. Place the saucepan on the stove over high heat, and bring to a boil.

Add the ground coffee to the water, give it a quick stir, then turn off the stove.

Tie the bundle tight to prevent coffee grounds from slipping through into the liquid, and make sure to leave enough twine or string at the end to hang out of the mug. This will give you something to pull the bundle out with when it’s done steeping. You’re essentially creating the coffee equivalent of a tea bag! This method works best if you only intend to prepare one cup of coffee at a time. If you want to prepare enough coffee to fill multiple mugs, create as many coffee filter bundles as you need, and place one in each mug."
