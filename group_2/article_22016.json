      "content": "Create a self-love routine. Establish a routine that helps you feel good about yourself. This can be anything -- doing your hair, nails, or wearing something that compliments your body. [1] X Research source These tasks do not have to be body related. They simply need to be tasks that help you feel better about yourself. Any task that makes you appreciate yourself is beneficial. Any grooming tasks will be helpful. Wearing clothes that make you feel good helps to boost your confidence. If you don’t feel good in your clothes, then it will be difficult to feel good without them. Do the routine often. In order to build confidence, repeat your routine at least once a week to establish a regular day or time that you dote on yourself. If you want your routine to have a walk in the park or go swimming, go for it. Go anywhere that makes you feel confident and/or comfortable."

      "content": "Eat healthy foods. Nothing can make you appreciate your body and dote on yourself like eating well. Eating well makes you remember to feed your body “good fuel” so that it functions properly and looks good. [2] X Research source It is difficult to appreciate your body if you’re thinking about the extra donuts you ate, or if you’re counting all of the wasted calories that you’ve taken in. It will make you feel insecure or guilty, which is counter to the confidence you’ll need to have fun naked. Don’t feel guilty about what you eat. If you’re going to eat it, don’t waste time counting all of the calories or thinking about it over and over again. This too is a confidence buster. Eat healthy foods as a reminder to appreciate the skin you’re in. The food itself is a reminder that your body deserves to be fed and treated well. If you're already on a healthy diet or meal plan, you don't have to overdo it. Take an evening snack once every other day or so if you feel like you're stressed over eating too healthy. Even though you want to be healthy, remember there is a thing that's called, \"being too healthy.\""

      "content": "Compliment yourself. Instead of putting yourself down constantly, compliment yourself. The confidence to have fun naked begins with not judging your body or putting yourself down. [3] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source With the process of complimenting yourself comes the responsibility of not doing certain things such as criticizing yourself. Don’t stand in front of the mirror and point out everything you don’t like. Point out a few things about yourself that you like. Write them down if necessary. Use these qualities to counter the negative judgements that you might make about yourself and your body. For instance, if you think something negative about yourself, counter it with one of the positive comments that you’ve already identified. So, counter “I hate my arms” with “I have great legs.” [4] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 121 wikiHow readers if they think mantras and affirmations help boost their mood, and 74% of them said yes.

Kickball, walking, karate, swimming and dancing, for instance, all are activities that can help you begin to associate having fun with moving your body. Physical activity sculpts and molds the body. Whichever activity you choose serves of dual purpose of body sculpting and enjoyment.

      "content": "Pamper your body. Get a massage or facial. The act of pampering yourself pays homage to your body. It helps you appreciate your body and love it, which makes it easier to incorporate several of the previous steps such as moving the body and eating healthily. Pampering yourself could be as simple as taking a long bath instead of a shower. Add some sea salt or flower petals to the water. Grooming activities such as shaving, combing the hair, and rubbing lotion on the body all are elements of pampering and self-appreciation. These tasks build an appreciation for the body that are independent from material adornments such as clothes, shoes and jewelry."

This also lets you get comfortable seeing yourself naked. If you’re uncomfortable looking at yourself naked, then you will be uncomfortable when others are looking at you naked.

If you are not comfortable going fully naked just yet, wear lingerie and build up. Lots of different types are available, so your bound to find one that will make you feel confident and sexy.

      "content": "Go to a Finnish, Turkish or Korean spa. Most Korean spas have gender-specific nude areas, which means you are free to go nude within the confines of specified areas. So, in the male area, men are free to go nude, and it’s the same in the female area. [7] X Research source Within these areas there are saunas, bathing areas and grooming areas. So, you can slowly get accustomed to being nude in the company of others. If you’re still not completely comfortable, use a small towel to partially cover yourself. Typically uniforms are available to wear as well. Come with a friend so that you have someone to talk to, if that makes you feel more comfortable. Some people may prefer to start with just strangers. Give yourself something to do. Bathe yourself or groom yourself while at the spa, and you won’t be totally focused on your nakedness. Also, while you're there, try to get a massage too. It'll help sooth your nakedness, and it will also sooth your back!"

If you have a significant other or have a supportive friend or family member, get naked around them only if the other person is comfortable with it. If you’re comfortable around your significant other, then you’ll be more comfortable during sex or other forms of sexual activity. Being naked around a supportive person also helps you gain confidence and set aside any fears. No one is going to gawk at you, point or laugh, which is some people’s greatest fears. Nude massages, for instance, are a way of acclimating yourself to being nude around others. Typically, the parts that are not being massaged are covered up with a towel, so you will have some sense of being covered."
