      "content": "Find a piece of square paper. Origami paper works best and is easier to fold, but you can also use a piece of computer or A4 paper cut to size. Choose origami paper according to what color you’d like your ninja star to be. You can make a 2-colored star with 2 different colors of paper if you'd like. [1] X Research source To make square paper, lay your rectangular paper in a flat, horizontal position. Take one corner of the paper and fold it over until it meets the opposite edge, forming a triangle, with a rectangular strip left over. Remove the rectangular portion of the paper by tearing or cutting it away with scissors . You only need 1 piece of square paper for this project, but throughout, we'll use 2 sheets with 2 different colors, as this will help make the process clearer as we go. You can follow along using 2 sheets, or feel free to just perform steps 1-3 on one piece of square paper."

      "content": "Fold your square paper in half to form a rectangle. Press down on the fold to make a strong crease. Then, unfold the paper. This is called a “valley fold,” which is when your fold creates a \"valley\" with its crease. [2] X Research source If you are using paper that has one colored side, start with the color side facing down. If you are using a single square sheet, draw an “O” on one (which will correspond with our “orange” sheet above), then a “B” on the other (which will go with the “blue” sheet) to help you differentiate as you follow the tutorial."

      "content": "Cut or tear along the creases to make 2 rectangles. Whether you started with 2 papers or 1, at this point, going forward, you'll just need 2 rectangular pieces of paper. [3] X Research source These pieces will eventually be folded together to make the throwing star. We use 2 different color rectangles to make things clearer for you, but you can use rectangles of the same color if you'd like!"

      "content": "Fold the rectangles in half on a vertical crease (hot dog style). This is called a “book fold.” [4] X Research source If you’re using computer paper and want to make a smaller ninja star, you can shorten your folded rectangles by cutting or tearing part of the paper off, but keep in mind that the longer your rectangles, the easier the ninja star will be to make. Make sure that both folded pieces of paper are the same length."

We’ll use this crease as a guideline, making the next folds easier. You should now have 2 folded rectangles with a valley fold running horizontally in the center of each. [5] X Research source"

Take the right half of your blue (“B”) piece of paper, and fold it so that the right edge is facing down, with the top edge now running along the center crease. Fold the left side of the paper in the opposite direction, upwards. [6] X Research source Take the right half of your orange (“O”) piece of paper, and fold it so that the right edge is facing up, with the bottom edge now running along the center crease. Fold the left side of the paper in the opposite direction, downwards. If done correctly, you will have two mirroring “Z” shaped pieces of paper."
