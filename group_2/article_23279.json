      "content": "Clusters of long, soft needles Pines have somewhat soft, bendy needles, so you can quickly eliminate trees that have regular leaves on their branches. [1] X Research source Pine needles grow in clusters, stemming from one single origin point. The clusters of pine needles will either be in twos, threes, or fives. [2] X Research source If you touch the needles and they feel bendy, this is an indication that it’s a pine tree. [3] X Research source The base of the needle cluster will be wrapped in a papery sheath (also known as a fascicle). [4] X Research source If you see clusters of 2, this is a red pine, while clusters of 3 are yellow pines, and clusters of 5 are white pines. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Stiff, reddish-brown cones that hang downward Mature pine cones are reddish-brown, or possibly black. [6] X Research source They’re hard and wood-like when you touch them, as opposed to other conifers’ cones which are much thinner and paper-like. Pine cones hang towards the ground, while fir cones stand upright. Young pine cones might appear to be growing upward, but as they mature, they’ll begin to droop and point downward."

      "content": "Points in the middle of each cone scale Pine cones can sometimes be identified by the unique points on certain species’ scales. Look at the end of each scale and see if the middle of the scale comes to a point. If it does, this is likely a pine cone. [7] X Research source Pine cone scales can be so tightly closed together when they are immature that the exposed portions form a striking pattern of many diamonds, Simpson shares. [8] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 14 July 2021. He also notes that some pine cones have very sharp spines in the center of each diamond. Look out for this before you grab a pine cone for a closer look! [9] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 14 July 2021."

[10] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 14 July 2021. Pine trees shed their oldest needles after roughly 3 years, which can leave them with less foliage. They may also lose their lower branches as they age, while most spruces and firs retain a triangular Christmas-tree shape in maturity. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Found in the mountains of the Northern Hemisphere Pine trees live and grow primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, and they like having access to the sunlight. While not every pine tree grows on a mountain, pines are abundant in mountainous areas. [12] X Research source They tend to grow in sandy soil, and don’t like swampy land that doesn’t drain easily. [13] X Research source Pines are able to thrive in colder weather and at a higher altitude, making them perfect mountain trees."

[15] X Research source White pine needles usually grow to be 2 1 ⁄ 2 to 5 inches (6.4 to 12.7 cm) long. Unlike some pines’ cones, the scales of white pine cones never have prickles."

Their cones are prickly, so be careful when you grab one. Mature ponderosa pines have either an orange, brown, or reddish-brown bark color."

      "content": "Fir Fir trees are easily distinguished from pines because their needles grow individually, Simpson says. [20] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 14 July 2021. To distinguish a fir tree from a spruce tree, feel its needles. While spruce needles can be rolled between your fingers, fir needles are flatter and can’t be rolled. [21] X Research source Another thing to look for is the direction the cones grow in—fir cones are fragile and grow upright like thin candles."

      "title": "Spruce",
      "content": "Spruce Like fir trees, spruce trees have individual needles that don’t grow in clusters. “Spruce trees have shorter needles [than pine trees] that appear to grow directly from each branch, and they’re spaced close together, like bristles on a hairbrush,” Simpson explains. [22] X Expert Source Michael Simpson, PhD Registered Professional Biologist Expert Interview. 14 July 2021. Spruce cones resemble pine cones, but have less rigid scales and feel less woody to the touch. If you can break a scale off the cone, it’s probably a spruce."

Cedar has a distinctive smell that’s pungent and featured in many fragrances."

Their cones are blue and berry-like—another standout feature. [29] X Research source"
