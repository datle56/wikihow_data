Because of this imperfection, the organ is pushed through an opening, resulting in a hernia. As the organ comes through the opening, it will create a swollen area or bulge in the skin. A hernia often gets bigger when you are standing or when you are straining. The site of the swollen area may vary depending on what kind hernia you have. The terms for different hernia types refer either to the location or the cause of the hernia.

Inflammation can cause a burning sensation or sharp pain. Pressure build-up can result in a tearing pain that suggests the hernia is directly touching the muscle walls. Here's how pain affects hernias in different stages: Irreducible hernia: the hernia cannot return to a normal state, but instead gets larger; you may feel occasional pain. Strangulated hernia: the bulging organ is losing its blood supply, and could be dead soon without medical attention. You'll feel significant pain in this case, along with nausea, vomiting, fever, trouble moving your bowels. This condition requires emergency surgery.

According to studies, even if a hernia that is present at birth — which is common in newborn babies — most of them are in male babies. The same is true throughout adult life! Men's greater risk can be explained through a hernia's connection to having undescended testicles. This is because a man’s testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly before birth. A male's inguinal canal — which holds the chords that connect with the testicles — usually closes after birth. In some cases, though, it does not close properly, making hernias more likely."
