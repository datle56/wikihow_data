      "title": "Clean the soda can with soap and hot water and let it dry.",
      "content": "Clean the soda can with soap and hot water and let it dry. Pour out any remaining liquid, and then use a bottle cleaner to scrub the inside of the can with soap and hot water. Place the can with the opening facing down to dry for at least 2-3 hours before starting to make your cookie cutters. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a bottle cleaner, you can roll up a paper towel to clean the inside of the can. However, be careful around the opening, since the edges can be sharp."

      "title": "Cut off the top and bottom of the soda can with sharp scissors.",
      "content": "Cut off the top and bottom of the soda can with sharp scissors. Push one of the blades of the scissors into the can about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) away from the lip on the top of the can, and then cut around the can to remove the top. Then, do the same with the bottom of the can so you have an aluminum cylinder that’s open on the top and the bottom. [2] X Research source If your scissors aren’t sharp enough to cut into the can, try using a box cutter to puncture the metal, and then finish cutting with the scissors. If you don’t have an empty soda can available, you can cut out the bottom sheet of an oven liner with a pair of sharp scissors."

      "title": "Use the scissors to cut strips out of the remaining can.",
      "content": "Use the scissors to cut strips out of the remaining can. Cut straight down the side of the cylinder so that the aluminum can lay flat on a table, like a sheet. Then, carefully cut strips of at least 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) in width from the can. It may be helpful to use a marker to draw guidelines for the strips, or you can make the cuts freehand. [3] X Research source For larger cookies, cut horizontally across the aluminum sheet that you made so that the strips are as long as possible. For smaller cookie cutters, cut the strips vertically so they’re shorter."

    {
      "title": "Bend the strips into the shapes that you like.",
      "content": "Bend the strips into the shapes that you like. Carefully take the strips in your hands and form them into the shape that you want. Remember, they don’t have to be perfect since you’ll be able to bend them slightly as needed if they’re not producing the results that you want. [4] X Research source If you have a more complicated shape, like a mustache, try tracing the shape onto a piece of cardboard. Then, cut the shape out of the cardboard, and bend the aluminum around the perimeter to form the cookie cutter. For some simple shapes you can make, try wrapping the strips around a cup to make a circle. You can bend different parts of the circle to make a heart or cloud shape. You can also easily make a triangle, square, or a crescent moon."

      "title": "Glue the ends of the cookie cutter together with food-grade glue.",
      "content": "Glue the ends of the cookie cutter together with food-grade glue. When the shape is ready, trim off any excess aluminum and hold the two ends of the strip together. Seal them with a food-safe adhesive, like Permabond or Hot Melt, and let the adhesive dry for at least 6 hours before using the cookie cutters. [5] X Research source If you don’t have food-safe adhesive, you can use regular tape to attach the edges. If you use tape, the cookie cutters will be more delicate, so be careful when you use them! Once you use the cookie cutters, you can hand-wash them with soap and water to reuse them. Be sure to let them dry completely before storing them to prevent rust."

      "title": "Print out the shape that you like onto a piece of photo paper.",
      "content": "Print out the shape that you like onto a piece of photo paper. This method is ideal for odd shapes, like logos, animals, or even silhouettes. Find a simple picture with a clear, easy-to-follow outline, and choose a sturdy photo paper that’s labeled as at least 8.5 mil thick or 75 pounds (34 kg). Once the image prints, let the ink dry for 2-3 minutes before handling the paper. [6] X Research source If you don’t have photo paper, you can print out the image on regular paper, and then trace the outline of the shape onto a piece of cardboard."

      "title": "Cut around the shape carefully to remove the excess paper.",
      "content": "Cut around the shape carefully to remove the excess paper. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut the shape out of the paper. Make sure you get as close to the outline of the image as possible. If you’re having trouble because the shape is complex, try working in small sections at a time to make sure you make the shape as accurate as possible. [7] X Research source If you’re making a cookie cutter for letters of the alphabet, use a sharp tool, like a craft knife, to carefully cut out any interior shapes."

      "title": "Place the shape on top of the rolled-out dough on a cookie sheet.",
      "content": "Place the shape on top of the rolled-out dough on a cookie sheet. Once you have the stencil made, roll out a sheet of chilled dough and position the stencil at the top of the dough. Try to place the stencil so that you can make as many cookies out of the sheet of dough as possible. [8] X Research source If you’re planning on baking the cookies immediately, place the dough on top of a sheet of parchment paper on the cookie sheet to prevent them from sticking to the metal."

    {
      "title": "Use a sharp knife to trace around the outside of the shape.",
      "content": "Use a sharp knife to trace around the outside of the shape. With your non-dominant hand, hold the stencil in place. Use your dominant hand to cut around the outline of the shape, following the stencil closely to make the shape as clean as possible. Then, cut out any shapes that need to be removed from the inside of the cookie. [9] X Research source Be careful while you’re cutting and holding the stencil in place. If the stencil moves, your shape might get ruined."

      "title": "Peel away the excess dough to reveal the shapes you made.",
      "content": "Peel away the excess dough to reveal the shapes you made. Once you’ve cut out as many shapes as possible on the sheet, pull the excess dough up and off of the sheet and set it aside. If you have interior cutouts, use a knife or your fingers to gently pull them out of the shape. Reposition the cookies on the sheet as needed before baking. [10] X Research source Remember, you can reuse the dough that you pulled off of the sheet. Simply form it into a ball and roll it out again to form a smaller sheet of dough. Once you’ve cut out all of your cookies, you can throw your cookie cutter away. Since it’s made of paper and can’t be cleaned, you shouldn’t reuse it."
