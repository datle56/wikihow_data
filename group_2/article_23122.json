      "content": "Hyna is a Mexican-American slang word for “nice-looking chick” or “girl.” Hyna is a fairly common slang word that originated in the Mexican-American community, and is often used when referring to a person’s girlfriend/significant other. While the word itself isn’t inherently positive or negative, it’s sometimes used to refer to women in a negative/objectifying light. [1] X Research source Someone might say “That’s Ángel’s hyna!” to refer to Ángel’s girlfriend. The actual slang is spelled as “jaina,” but it’s pronounced (and often spelled) as “hyna.” Hyna can be used as an endearing term for a significant other. Just as guys often call their girlfriends “babe” or “honey,” the word “hyna” can be used in a similar way. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "You should only use “hyna” if you know the other person well. “Hyna” is a very casual way of telling a woman that they look good—in some cases, it can even come off as rude if you don’t explain your intentions. [3] X Research source Only use this word if you feel like the other person won’t take offense to it. “Adrian’s hyna is looking great!” “I can’t take my eyes off that hyna!” Important note: As a slang word, “hyna” is used pretty exclusively by the Mexican-American community. If you aren’t a member of this community, you don’t have any real reason to use it."

      "content": "A misspelling of HyunA, a South Korean artist In rare instances, someone might write “HyunA” as “hyna” (or something similar) if they type the singer’s name too quickly and make a typo. This isn’t very common, though—you’d only find this typo on a K-Pop-related social media post or comment."

      "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 In the video game Cyberpunk 2077 , a character named Jackie calls the main character (who you play as) “hyna.” In the context of the game, he seems to mean it in a casual and non-romantic sense, since he and the main character aren’t romantically involved. [4] X Research source Some players took issue with the fact that Jackie uses such a stereotype-ridden slang word in a game that’s set several decades into the future."
