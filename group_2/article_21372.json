For the onion to sit above the water without falling in, you will need to make sure the vegetable is supported. Make sure the toothpicks are placed just slightly below the middle of the onion. [2] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Preferably, you’ll want to use an onion that has already sprouted. An onion that has already begun the growth process will have an easier time growing in water. If you want to forgo the toothpick method, you can fill a clear glass jar nearly to the top with small rocks or pebbles. Then, place the onion on top of the pebbles and fill the jar with water, ensuring that just the roots and base of the onion are submerged. [3] X Research source"

This way, the roots will be able to take in water and allow the onion to grow while the rest of the onion is surrounded by air and not rot. [4] X Research source Take time to make sure the toothpicks are properly supporting the onion so it doesn’t fall into the water. At this point, you may need to push the toothpicks deeper into the onion to ensure that the onion is well supported."

      "content": "Place the glass with the onion onto a windowsill that gets plenty of sunlight. Onions need at least six hours of sunlight to grow well. You also want to make sure you don't forget about the onion, so find a nice sunny windowsill that is in a busy part of your home. Now, all that’s left is to wait and watch your onion grow. Over a week, you will see the roots grow into the water, and a green sprout will rise from the top. Regularly change the water. Do this before the water gets murky or smelly. Gently lift the onion, replace the water, and place the onion back onto the top of the jar."

The entire sprout is edible and has a deliciously sharp, herbal taste. Take scissors and cut the green sprout from the top of the onion, then cut it into thin strips. Add the cut pieces to soup or salad as a tasty garnish. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Plant the onion in the soil when you notice a flower stem emerging from the top. Growing an onion in water is a really fun way to watch the early steps of vegetable growth. However, the onion cannot grow this way forever. After a few weeks, a flower stem will emerge. At this point, you can either plant the entire onion in the soil or just discard the onion. After the onion has started to flower, it can no longer grow in water and must be potted in soil. You don't have to wait for a flower stem to emerge if you want to plant your onion sooner. Once you see white roots growing out of the onion, it's ready to plant. [6] X Expert Source Steve Masley Home & Garden Specialist Expert Interview. 20 March 2019."

Just use those. If not, grab a fresh bunch of green onions (also known as scallions or spring onions) and carefully use a knife or scissors to make the proper cut. [7] X Research source At this point, you should have a piece of white bulb around the size of an adult's pinky finger. It’s okay if there is a bit of green left as well. Use the discarded green onion bits as an ingredient. Green onions make an excellent garnish on top of dishes like ramen noodles or tacos. Slice it thinly and sprinkle over your meal to brighten up the dish with color and flavor."

You can use a rubber band to tie the bunch together to provide additional support. One of the best parts about growing kitchen scraps is being able to watch them grow, so be sure to use a clear vessel so you can watch the magic happen."

Although this will work once or twice, within a few cycles the plant will stop growing. [14] X Research source"
