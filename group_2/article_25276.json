      "title": "Visit department stores in person.",
      "content": "Visit department stores in person. Sephora and Nordstrom are two of the best department stores for getting completely free perfume samples. If the store doesn’t carry samples of a particular perfume you’re interested in, many of them will decant a bottle and make you a sample of your choice. Bring a few zip-lock baggies, some small sticky labels and a handful of cotton balls with you. If there is no other way to bring home a sample, simply spritz the perfume on the cotton ball and put it in the baggie. Be sure to label each baggie with the perfume brand and name. Take it home with you and spend some time with the scent to see if you're interested in it."

      "content": "Bring empty sample vials with you into department stores. If the store doesn't have the perfume you want to sample and they don’t have any empty sample vials to create one for you, ask if they would be willing to fill up an empty vial you have with you. [1] X Research source Some department stores are happy to fill empty vials that you brought with you. Others don't like it doing it, so it really just depends on where you are. However, it never hurts to be prepared by having the vials on you and asking a sales associate once you arrive."

      "content": "Request samples at the register whenever you make a purchase. If you are at a department store making an unrelated purchase, always request a few free perfume samples at the register when you’re checking out. Even if your purchase is a relatively low cost item, you should still ask for a few perfume samples. Most department stores are happy to comply with your request. Giving free samples with a purchase is pretty standard practice at these establishments, since they want your repeat business."

      "title": "Visit the perfume manufacturer’s website.",
      "content": "Visit the perfume manufacturer’s website. [2] X Research source Check to see if the company is giving away free samples through their own online storefront. If the manufacturer is giving samples away, it will probably say so on their homepage. If you don't see a blurb about free samples on the homepage, look for a tab on the menu that says \"Free Samples\" or \"Freebies.\""

    {
      "title": "Request free samples directly from the perfume manufacturer.",
      "content": "Request free samples directly from the perfume manufacturer. If the manufacturer isn't giving away any samples on their website, look for the company’s physical address and write a letter to them directly to request free samples. This strategy doesn’t work 100% of the time, but it’s worth a try! It does pay off occasionally. Company addresses are usually located at the very bottom of the webpage, in small print, or they can be found under the “About Us” or “Contact Us” menu tabs. Mailing a physical letter is more likely to get you free samples than sending an email. Business websites are bombarded by emails every day, but physically receiving a personal letter from a customer is becoming a rarity. It will usually get someone’s attention. It wouldn’t hurt to throw a few compliments in the letter about how much you like their brand, how excited you are to try a sample, etc."
