      "content": "Place a bed skirt between the box spring and mattress to hide the frame. Take your mattress off the box spring and place it against the wall. Then center the bed skirt (also sometimes called a “bed ruffle” or a “valance”) on the box spring so that the edges of the skirt are parallel to or just lightly touch the floor. [1] X Research source Bed skirts come in different lengths. Measure from the floor to the top of the box spring to determine what length you need . Choose a bed skirt that matches the color of your sheets or complements the color scheme in your bedroom to incorporate your bed into your room’s decor. For a classic, feminine look, use a ruffled or gathered bed skirt. For a sleek, modern feel, opt for a tailored bed skirt."

      "content": "Place a mattress topper and pad on the mattress for added comfort. A mattress topper adds another plush layer of padding between you and the mattress itself, enhancing your bed’s coziness. [2] X Research source Lay the topper over the mattress and position it so that its edges align with the edges of the mattress. Then, stretch a mattress pad , which protects your topper and mattress from spills, over the topper, tucking the elastic under the mattress’ corners. Both mattress toppers and pads are sold according to the size of your bed. If you have a queen-sized bed, purchase a queen-sized mattress topper, and so on. Some mattress pads also provide extra cushioning. Look for one that’s labeled as “pillow-top,” “memory foam,” or “extra plush.” Alternatively, cover the mattress with a plastic or vinyl mattress protector to shield it from bed bugs, dander, or other allergens. Or, cover the mattress with a protector, and place the topper and pad over the protector."

      "content": "Stretch a fitted sheet over the 4 corners of the mattress. A fitted sheet is the foundation of your linens, adding a layer of protection between your mattress pad and everything else. Drape the fitted sheet so that it’s oriented with the bed—the tags on the corner usually align with the top left or bottom right corner of the mattress. [3] X Research source Working 1 corner at a time, tuck the elastic edges all the way under the mattress so that they don’t ride up or come undone. [4] X Research source If you have a tall mattress, like one with a pillow top, use a deep fitted sheet to better cover the mattress. Most sheet sets come with a fitted sheet. But if you prefer, use a flat sheet instead. Drape it over the mattress, center it, then tuck the edges under the mattress on all sides."

      "title": "Tuck the edges of a flat sheet underneath the mattress.",
      "content": "Tuck the edges of a flat sheet underneath the mattress. A flat sheet , or “top sheet,” goes between you and your comforter, keeping the comforter free of oils and dirt. Lay the flat sheet over the fitted sheet, lining up the top edge with the top edge of the mattress, and letting the other 3 edges hang over the sides of the mattress. Then make hospital corners at the bottom edge of the bed—tuck the bottom edge under the foot of the mattress. Finally, tuck the sides, which makes a neat, crisp fold at the corners. [5] X Research source The top of the flat sheet—the edge that goes at the head of the bed—often has a wide hem or decorative trim. Remove wrinkles from your sheets by ironing them or spritzing them with water as you pull them across the bed. Put sheets that have a pattern on the bed with the pattern facing down. That way, when you fold it back over the blanket, the pattern will be showing."

      "title": "Drape a blanket over the flat sheet, then fold back the top.",
      "content": "Drape a blanket over the flat sheet, then fold back the top. Position your blanket, or “ coverlet ” (a thin, single-layer blanket), so that the top edge aligns with the top edge of the mattress. Then drape the other 3 edges evenly over the sides. Finally, fold the top sheet and blanket down about 18 in (46 cm) from the top of the bed, providing space for your pillows, an easy entrance to slip into the bed, and a nice accent to the bed itself, all at the same time. [6] X Research source For an even cleaner look, also make hospital corners at the bottom edge of the blanket and tuck the side edges under the mattress."

      "title": "Place a duvet or comforter on top of the blanket for a luxurious feel.",
      "content": "Place a duvet or comforter on top of the blanket for a luxurious feel. Add a downy duvet (a 2-piece blanket), plush comforter (a single-piece, stuffed blanket), or soft quilt over the coverlet to give your bed some comfy color. A nice top layer not only brings the whole bed together, but also provides additional warmth in the colder months. Drape and fold the duvet over the bed in the same way you added the coverlet, but fold it a bit further down to reveal the bed’s layers. [7] X Research source Use a duvet cover to cheaply upgrade an old comforter instead of buying a new one. Simply stuff the comforter inside the cover. In addition, go for all-white linens for that deluxe hotel look, and accent them with a colored coverlet or duvet."

      "content": "Set throw pillows and a throw blanket on the bed to make it more inviting. Start with the full-sized pillows you sleep on. Fluff your pillows, then position on each side of the bed if your bed is larger than a twin, and go for just 2 pillows total for a twin bed. Then add 2-3 throw pillows and a folded throw blanket that matches the color of your blanket or duvet in front of the sleeping pillows for a sensible touch. [8] X Research source Place firmer pillows like memory foam pillows at the back, and keep softer pillows up front to make the bed look as soft and cozy as possible. Set a longer lumbar pillow in front of the sleeping pillows to make the arrangement a bit more cohesive. Choose throw pillows in a variety of shapes, sizes, and textures for a playful, bohemian effect."
