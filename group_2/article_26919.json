Gently massage the nugget to flatten it as much as possible. [1] X Research source Make sure you use parchment paper rather than wax paper or ordinary writing paper. Parchment paper is heat resistant and won’t burn or contaminate your nugget with melted wax."

If not, you may need to buy an adjustable straightener that lets you control the heat. [2] X Research source You can also check the temperature of your hair straightener with an infrared (laser) thermometer. You can get one of these handy gadgets at a hardware or office supply store. If the nugget gets too hot, you could burn away terpenes and THC, which will give you a lower-quality rosin. [3] X Research source"

Squeeze hard for about 3-5 seconds, then check the wax paper to see if any oil has come out of the nugget. [4] X Research source It should look like a brownish, sticky liquid surrounding the nugget. [5] X Research source You’ll hear a sizzling sound when the nugget begins to release rosin. [6] X Research source The lower the temperature of the hair straightener, the longer you’ll need to squeeze. However, try not to press for longer than 10 seconds at a time to avoid burning the nugget. You may need to press the nugget multiple times to release all the oils. Transfer the nugget to a new piece of paper between presses."

Use a small kitchen scale to figure out how much rosin you have. If you’re weighing the rosin in a container, weigh the container empty first. Then, weigh it again with the rosin inside. Subtract the weight of the vessel to find the weight of the rosin. Some recipes recommend extracting as much as 1 gram (0.035 oz), but you generally don’t need a lot to fill a little vape pen cartridge."

Starting with 8 drops is usually a good bet, but you may need to add more or less than that. If you add too much, the smoke could sting your nose and throat, while too little won’t make your rosin juicy enough to vaporize properly. Experiment with different amounts of terpenes until you get the results you want. [8] X Research source While many recipes recommend using PG (propylene glycol), PEG (polyethylene glycol), or VG (vegetable glycerin) as liquidizers, these products might be unsafe to inhale. Some researchers think they may release formaldehyde or other irritating or toxic gases when you heat them up. [9] X Research source Popular terpenes include phytol, linalool, and limonene. You can also buy terpenes in a variety of flavors to boost the taste of your vape juice. While terpenes are often thought to be safer than other liquidizers, there’s still not a lot of research out there on the possible health effects of vaping them. [10] X Research source You can buy terpenes and other liquidizers online or from stores that sell vape products. Always research the product to make sure it’s made by a reputable manufacturer who’s transparent about the ingredients they use."

It’s totally safe to eat food-grade VG, but unfortunately, it’s still not clear how safe it is to inhale it. Some studies show that it may degrade into unsafe chemicals called carbonyls when heated.

The basic canola or vegetable oil that you can buy in the baking aisle at your grocery store will work fine. [18] X Research source Alternatively, make a hot water bath by pouring water into the dish instead of oil. [19] X Research source However, keep in mind that water baths tend to evaporate quickly and can be hard to maintain at a stable temperature for long periods of time. [20] X Research source Don’t overfill the oil bath, since the hot oil could overflow when you add the container of marijuana and VG. Make sure the dish is no more than two thirds full. A Pyrex bowl that’s about 8–9 inches (20–23 cm) wide and at least 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) deep will work well.

Turn the hot plate on at a low heat setting and wait for the oil to reach a temperature of 220 °F (104 °C). Adjust the heat up or down as needed until the temperature is stable. [21] X Research source It’s important to keep the temperature precise and stable so that you don’t overcook the marijuana, which will reduce the potency of your vape juice.

If you want to save the terpenes, heat up the oil at the end of the extraction process instead. If you choose to decarboxylate later, you’ll still need to dry out the buds first.

      "content": "Thin the extract with a few drops of liquidizer. Your finished cannabis oil will probably be a bit too thick and gooey to vape. To thin it out a little, add a liquidizer, such as vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, or terpenes. Warm up the oil in the microwave on a low heat setting (like defrost) for about 90 seconds to liquefy it. Then, mix equal parts oil and liquidizer to create your vape juice. [59] X Research source While vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol are two of the most common liquidizers used to make vape juice, it’s still not clear how safe it is to inhale them. Be aware that vaping these chemicals could damage your lungs. [60] X Research source"
