[3] X Research source If you need to unfriend or block your ex-girlfriend on social media, then you should. You do not have to let your ex-girlfriend know that you are taking these steps.

Do whatever you need to do to heal from the relationship such as meditating, journaling, or spending time alone watching movies. If there are personality traits or issues that you had in the relationship such as anger, jealousy, insecurity, taking her for granted, or being controlling begin to work on those things.

[5] X Research source If you send a text message, try to say something that starts a conversation, is flirty in nature, and does not bring up anything negative. Try texting, \"Hey, I was watching X on TV and I it made me think of you :)\" You could also text them about a good memory that you guys made together.

Do not make this out to be a big deal. Try saying, \"Hey, do you want to go get coffee or something?\" or \"Let's get together to catch up.\" You can also use the phrase \"hang out\" instead of \"date.\" [8] X Research source If she is reluctant, you might say, \"It's only coffee. What would it hurt?\" If she does not want to meet up with you, do not push the issue. Give her space. Tell her, \"I respect that you don't want to meet up, let me know if you change your mind.

If you used to send her flowers or write her sweet notes, begin to do those things again. Think of this opportunity as a new relationship. You need to make her fall for you again. [9] X Research source Although you want to impress her, do not be needy or beg her to be with you again. This will only make you look insecure or weak. You want her to take you back because you are a great guy not because she feels sorry for you. [10] X Research source Do not say things like, \"I can't live without you.\""
