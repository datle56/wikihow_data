      "content": "Purchase a large plastic tub to serve as a litter box. All you really need is something to hold the litter, though there are more expensive versions that offer a self-cleaning function or grass on top (with waste collecting in a lower pan). [1] X Research source The box should be big enough for your dog to turn around in. The sides should be low enough that your dog can enter by himself, but high enough to stop your dog from peeing out of the box if he lifts his leg. If you buy a box with a hood, consider cutting the top off to make the box easier for your dog to use and for you to clean."

      "content": "Put the box in a place that is easily accessed, but private. You want the box near the places your dog spends most of his time, but also out of the way enough that you’re not watching him. Don’t place the box near your dog’s food and water, as dogs will not eliminate where they eat. Be aware that dogs have a tendency to dig in their box, especially at first. Place it so that any litter thrown out during digging will not cause too much of a mess."

      "content": "Make sure each cat and dog has its own box. Your cat needs to feel ownership of his box, or he will start peeing outside the box to mark his territory. And if you have two dogs, it’s best to get each of them their own box to avoid similar issues with territoriality. [3] X Research source"
