      "content": "Say hi when you see him. Sometimes you have to give someone a little attention to get them to notice you. It can be hard, but when you see your crush, take a deep breath to gather your nerves, then make eye contact, smile, and say hi. You can even throw in a little wave, if you'd like! [1] X Research source If you see the boy you like several times a day, just say hi the first time you see him. You can still make eye contact and smile when you bump into him later, though!"

      "content": "Strike up a conversation when the two of you are near each other. If you're just passing him in the hall, a simple \"Hi\" might be enough. However, if you're sitting next to each other at a pep rally or standing by each other in the lunch line, it might be awkward if you don't say anything else after that. Try talking about whatever's going on around you for an easy way to make small talk. [2] X Research source For instance, if you run into each other while you're at a concert, you might say, \"Have you heard this band before? I came with my friend, but she says they're really good.\" If you sit next to each other in class, you could chat before the bell rings. For example, you might say, \"Hey did you study for the quiz today?\""

      "content": "Ask open-ended questions about his interests. If you ask a question that can be answered with \"Yes\" or \"No,\" chances are that's the only response you're going to get. Try to get creative by asking him questions that will require him to elaborate on his answer a little. [3] X Research source For instance, if you're talking about school, instead of saying, \"Do you like English class?\" you might say, \"Who's your favorite teacher?\" If he mentions watching TV, instead of saying \"Do you watch The Voice?\" you could say, \"What kind of stuff do you like to watch?\" If he gives you a short answer anyway, try saying something like, \"Oh yeah? Why?\""

If he mentions any things you like too, make a note of them. Then, try to mention them when you are around him. [4] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. If you discover that you both love This Is Us, for instance, you'll have something to talk about every time a new episode airs! It's okay to talk about things you don't have in common, too! For instance, if he loves hockey but you don't know anything about it, you can still ask, \"Hey, did your team win their game last night?\""

      "content": "Get his number, then text him casually. Texting can be a great way to get to know someone, because they have time to think about what they want to say. However, when you're just starting to get to know a guy, it's best to keep your texts brief and positive. [5] X Research source For instance, you might text him something like, \"Hey! I can't read what I wrote in my science notes from today's class! Can you snap me a pic of your notes?\" Just keep in mind that it doesn't necessarily mean that a guy likes you just because he's texting you. Try to just act natural, as if you're texting your best friend."

For instance, you might invite him to sit with you and your friends at an assembly, or you might ask him to be your lab partner if you have science class together. [6] X Research source Make sure to balance this with giving him plenty of space, though. It's probably not a good idea to follow him everywhere he goes—just look for organic opportunities to spend time around each other when you can."

      "content": "Allow your relationship to deepen over time. It can be a little awkward if someone you hardly know tells you everything about their personal life, so hold your secrets close to your chest at first. As you and your crush get to know each other better, he'll see it as a sign of trust when you open up to him. For instance, when you're first getting to know each other, you might casually mention that you love 80s New Wave music. After you get closer, you could tell him that the reason is because your favorite aunt always plays it when you go over to her house, and it reminds you of her. As you're getting to know each other better, take the time to make sure your values match up. For instance, if you feel kindness is an important quality in another person, pay attention to the way the guy treats others to make sure you're comfortable with it."

However, it's really important to be yourself so you can find the person who's going to like you for your unique personality. You're perfect for someone, even if it's not the person you have a crush on right this second. [7] X Research source For instance, if you like hanging out indoors but your crush wants someone who's super outdoorsy, don't pretend like you love camping. If you do end up going camping together, he'll probably be able to tell you're not into it, and he'll feel betrayed that you lied."

Each morning, wash your face, shower, and brush your teeth. Put on clean, wrinkle-free clothes that fit you comfortably, and take a few moments to style your hair. [8] X Research source If you wear makeup, try to keep it light and natural —focus on enhancing the features you like the most. For instance, you use concealer to cover any blemishes, then add a little mascara and gloss to enhance your eyes and lips. Most guys are very visual, so putting effort into your grooming and appearance can make you seem more attractive to him. Guys do tend to respond first to someone's appearance, although over time, your character and personality will have a bigger part in whether they want to date you."

[9] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. Whenever you think about it, straighten your back, push your shoulders back, and lift your chin slightly. Making eye contact with other people, rather than looking at your feet, will make you seem more confident, too. [10] X Research source If you start to feel nervous or insecure, try taking several long, deep breaths to help yourself calm down and feel confident again. Also, when you speak, try to keep your tone calm and relaxed to seem more self-assured."

      "content": "Don't tease your crush or try to make him jealous. Sometimes when you like a guy, you might feel tempted to tease him or put him in his place. Teasing your crush might seem like a way to throw off his suspicion that you like him or to break any tension between you. However, if you hurt his feelings, spend all your time talking about other guys, or make him feel bad about himself, he probably won't want to spend time around you. [12] X Research source For instance, if he says, \"I like your bow,\" but you're wearing a headband, don't roll your eyes and say \"It's a headband! Boys are so dumb!\" Instead, smile and say something like, \"Oh, my headband? Thanks, this is my favorite color!\" Similarly, it's not okay for a guy to tease you to the point of hurting your feelings. A little light joking is okay, but if you feel like he crosses a line into being unkind, it's a good idea to spend your time around other people, instead."

Even if they have a tough exterior, you might be surprised to learn that many guys appreciate positivity and kindness in others, especially someone they're thinking about dating. If you constantly complain, gossip about others, or put other people down, your crush is probably going to think less of you. Instead, try to talk about other people in a way that builds them up, and try to find the bright side in any situation rather than only seeing the bad. For instance, instead of saying, \"Gabby did SO BAD on her presentation in Debate Club today,\" you might say, \"I felt bad for Gabby. You could tell she worked hard on her presentation but it just didn't go well.\" As another example, if you find yourself waiting for the bus, instead of complaining, \"The bus is always late—it's so annoying!\" you might say, \"That's cool, it gives us a few more minutes to talk.\" This will also help you seem less dramatic. Since a lot of guys really hate drama, this can make you seem more attractive."

By staying focused on your schoolwork, extracurricular activities, or hobbies, you'll feel more self-assured and independent, and that's going to be obvious to your crush, as well. For instance, if you have violin lessons every Wednesday, but your crush invites you to hang out, say something like, \"Oh I'd love to but I have a lesson that day. Can we hang out Thursday, instead?\""

However, if you're aware of what you're doing, you can do this intentionally to send a subtle message to your crush that you're into him. [14] X Research source For instance, if he leans forward with his elbows on the table, or if he brushes his hair back, you might do the same. Don't go overboard with this—if you're obvious enough that he notices, it will probably seem weird to him."

If you feel comfortable doing so, touch his arm when he says something funny, for instance. You could also lay your hand on his if he's talking about having a bad day. Then, pay attention to his reaction to make sure he's okay with it. If he pulls away or frowns, it could mean he isn't into you, or he wants to stay just friends. Give him a little space and see how he reacts. If he smiles or seems comfortable with the touch, it could mean he likes you, although he may just be okay with being physically affectionate with his friends."

      "content": "Compliment him to let him know what you like about him. A compliment is a great way to brighten someone else's day, and it can be a very effective flirting technique, as well. Try to compliment something about his personality or his accomplishments, for instance, to let him know that your feelings for him are more than just superficial. [15] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I thought it was really amazing how you stood up for Steven when he was being bullied.\" You could also say, \"You always make me feel good about myself when I'm around. I really like that.\" It's okay to compliment his appearance, too, especially if he's recently changed something. For instance, if you say, \"Hey Jeremy, your haircut looks great,\" it lets him know that you noticed his new 'do and you like it!"

You don't necessarily have to call it a date, but spending some time alone with your crush will give both of you a chance to figure out how the other one feels. Try to stick to something casual, so if the vibe isn't right, it won't be too awkward. [16] X Research source For instance, you might ask him if he wants to grab a burger with you after school, or you might ask him if he'll meet you in the library for an hour after school to help you study for your Spanish mid-term."

[17] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"Hey Josh, I think you're a really great guy, and I'm really into you. Do you want to go out with me?\" If you're shy, try sending him a text or a note telling him how you feel, instead. [18] X Research source"
