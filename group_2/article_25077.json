      "content": "Clean out potential hiding spots. Black widows hole up in seldom-disturbed areas, such as woodpiles, storage boxes, the back of closets, and so on. Not only will cleaning these areas eliminate potential habitats, you'll also get rid of areas for black widow prey to live. [1] X Research source Wear gardening gloves. Just in case you do stumble over a spider, your hands will be safe from bites. De-clutter. If you have unnecessary boxes, wood or other items crowding your house, getting rid of them can remove potential hiding places. Vacuum. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment, use it to clean out dark nooks and crannies. If you see a web without a spider in it, the vacuum is your best bet. Just be sure to seal the bag and dispose of it (outside the house) as soon as you're done so nothing can escape back into your home. Spray down the outside of your house. Use a high-pressure hose to destroy webs and egg sacs. Pay particular attention to window wells, window frames, and door frames. Clear vegetation that is in direct contact with your home. Ivy and other plant life on your house or around its perimeter provide a home for these pests. Clean regularly. Chores like vacuuming and keeping your living area clean aid in preventing spider infestation. Vacuuming is especially important because it clears out dust, eggs and the spiders themselves."

      "content": "Squash it. If you don't have a pesticide handy, grab a shoe or other flat object and kill the spider the old-fashioned way. Keep in mind that black widows are quick, and they might run toward you instead of away from you (like most other spiders do)."

      "title": "Hunt Them.",
      "content": "Hunt Them. A bit after sunset, say 9 or 10 pm in the summer time, search for widows in the places you know they are making a home. This is evident by the tough webs they make. Arm yourself with a flashlight, spray glue or hairspray (some sticky aerosol), long pants, shoes,etc. look for them about a foot off of the ground. When you see one, spray it. This alone will kill the widows, reduce the numbers, and keep you from needing long term pesticides."

      "content": "Powder the web. Black widows spend a lot of time on their webs, whether it's to guard an egg sac or wait for prey. Sprinkle a non-repellant insecticidal dust over the web when you find it â€” the dust will eventually kill the spider. Return to the web to make sure the spider is dead, and dispose of both in a sealed plastic bag."
