      "content": "An expressive Cancer will enjoy using emojis to add character to a text. Emojis and GIFs can help convey your mood and intentions in ways that a plain text message sometimes can't. A smiley emoji can add warmth to a regular text, and a funny GIF can make him laugh. Any cute emoji that adds some emotional depth to your text is sure to interest a Cancer guy! Add a smiley face to some texts. \"Let's chat today\" could be misinterpreted as severe or unenthusiastic, whereas \"Let's chat today! üòä\" makes your text more friendly and appealing. Use emojis just to make your text a little cuter. \"My dog says hi! I think he misses you. üê∂\" Emojis can also make it clear when you're flirting. \"I really like getting to know you! üòç\" or \"You've been on my mind a lot today‚Ä¶and it's 9 AM. üòâ\" Use GIFs your Cancer will find funny. If you both love Friends , start sending GIFs from the show with a few of your texts (including the classic Joey \"How you doin'?\" GIF when you're feeling flirty)."
