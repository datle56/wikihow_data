      "title": "Keep your hair short and textured.",
      "content": "Keep your hair short and textured. Jett’s trademark coif is dark and chin-length, but you don’t have to go jet-black to go Joan Jett. Nor do you have to copy her signature length: your hair can be as short as a pixie cut or as long as a shoulder-length bob. The key to channeling Jett’s spunky hairstyle is texture. Ask your stylist to make your ‘do as choppy as possible. Bring a photo of Jett to ensure your stylist gets the picture. Your stylist will razor shear your hair to get that jagged look while also cutting out some bangs."

      "content": "Use products at home for everyday styling. With the right razor-sheared haircut, your daily styling routine shouldn’t be too intense, but there are a few instruments and products you will want to have on hand. Even if your hair is naturally straight, you’ll want to use a straightener to accentuate your jagged locks and make the look more dramatic. Get creative with gels, hair waxes, and non-sticky hair sprays to make your spiky look more durable. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Experiment with color.",
      "content": "Experiment with color. If you want to try out Jett’s signature black, try a demi-permanent home or salon treatment first. This way you can make sure the change isn’t too startling for your daily life. If you want to stay away from dark dyes, consider dying a streak or several streaks of your hair bright colors. This kind of half-measure adds a healthy dollop of punk to your look without forcing you to commit to a complete color overhaul. When going for a bright color, get your hair professionally bleached before applying the colored dye. In-home bleaching is possible, but you’ll get the best and safest results from a professional colorist. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Master the smoky eye.",
      "content": "Master the smoky eye . Be bold: don't be afraid of a heavily-smudged, dark eye. It's part of Jett's signature gritty aesthetic and will complement the rest of your ensemble. Start with a primer , which can help keep your makeup from smearing or settling into wrinkles. Then apply concealer to your eyelid and under-eye so you begin with a neutral, smooth canvas and eliminate dark circles. [3] X Research source Apply a dark eyeshadow to your eyelid from lash-line up to the crease. Be sure to blow on the brush first to remove any excess shadow. Using a small, angled brush, apply the shadow to your lower lash-line. [4] X Research source Blend and smudge the edges of the shadow. You can use a cotton swab or a brush for this job. Remember that a smoky eye should not have any sharp lines. Tight-line your upper eyelid with eyeliner. This means the eyeliner is so tight against your lashes that there is no skin visible between line and lash. [5] X Research source Then add a medium-shade eyeshadow on top of the dark shadow and blend upward toward the crease. The color should be dark by your lashes and taper in intensity as you move up toward the crease, until it is almost sheer. Make sure you blend and buff out any harsh lines. Don't forget to curl your lashes and apply mascara to complete the look."

      "content": "Keep makeup on your cheeks muted. You don't want your facial makeup to compete with your bold eyes, so keep this part of your look softer. Brushing on some bronzer or light blush should be enough to highlight your cheekbones while still allowing your dramatic eyes to take the spotlight. Don’t be afraid of rocking pale skin! While a healthy tan has been in vogue for a couple of decades, Jett’s look is unapologetically fair. Embracing your pale persona will offset the dramatic colors and texture of your hair, as well as the dark and metallic tones of your ensemble."

      "title": "Coat your lips in a matte nude tone.",
      "content": "Coat your lips in a matte nude tone. If you take the time to browse photo galleries of Jett's storied career, you'll find that Jett's smoldering eye was almost always paired with a matte nude lip. While the nude lip is Jett’s customary look, feel free to experiment with darker crimsons and browns. Jett’s early career placed her just as firmly in the glam-rock scene as it did in the punk-rock one, and she has frequently identified the famously lipstick-loving David Bowie as her personal style icon. Try a matte liquid lipstick for maximum stain and minimal upkeep."

      "title": "Lay the foundation of your outfit with the right pair of jeans.",
      "content": "Lay the foundation of your outfit with the right pair of jeans. As Jett’s career has spanned several decades, she has rocked all colors, kinds, and cuts of denim over the years. Be them boot cut, flared, skinny, or straight leg, any cut of jeans can channel Joan Jett’s tough, retro style. The key to making any pair work is fit and color. As a general rule, opt for darker washes of blue, slate gray, or black denim. Lighter washes can work if you’re going for an old-school Ramones vibe, but make sure they’re obviously stone-washed or bleached or otherwise vintage. [6] X Research source No matter what cut of jeans you select, go for a slim fitting leg. Skinny jeans and slim straight legs look great with Jett’s signature sneakers, but boot cuts and flares can also look long and sleek if they’re fitted properly. Get creative. Distressed or cuffed details on your denim can add visual interest and edge to your Jett-inspired outfit. If your jeans feel a little bare or simple, consider spiffing them up with a few safety pins, metal studs, or a DIY bleach job."

      "title": "Layer your tops for maximum effect.",
      "content": "Layer your tops for maximum effect. Joan’s style is famously androgynous, so the key to mimicking her look is balancing feminine articles with masculine ones. For your bottom layer, pick out a black tank top or white wife-beater that goes with anything. If you’re fresh out of these undergarment staples, a lacy camisole or ripped-up band T-shirt will serve just as well. Pop a leather motorcycle jacket, destructed sweater, or masculine blazer over your bottom layer. Dark colors should dominate your outfit, but inject flashes of color—particularly reds, oranges, and pinks—to amp up the attitude. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear Chuck Taylor sneakers or boots.",
      "content": "Wear Chuck Taylor sneakers or boots. While Jett was known to rock a heel from time to time, her signature look has to be the Chucks. [8] X Research source Though Chucks come in all hues and prints, opt for a darker shade to complement your dark denim. If you’re not in the mood for sneakers, a pair of combat or motorcycle boots will always work. For a cheaper alternative to real leather, pick up a pair of vegan leather booties or ankle boots. If you’re going for Joan’s glam-rock, concert-ready look, some retro glitter wedges or platform-heeled ankle boots will pair perfectly with your bell-bottomed jump suit or other over-the-top ensemble."

      "title": "Accessorize with bold and eclectic jewelry.",
      "content": "Accessorize with bold and eclectic jewelry. Jett’s style depends heavily on her jewelry and supplemental sartorial details. Anything chunky and metallic is a must, and you can’t go wrong with leather or pleather accents. When selecting your neckwear, choose a black leather or suede choker. Alternatively, you could slip on a heavy chain or dog tag necklace. More is more when it comes to bracelets. Chunky studded leather cuffs or gobs of bangles (or both!) will always go splendidly with your Jett-inspired outfit."

      "content": "Loop a black, studded leather belt through your pair of jeans. Jett’s black belt has become part of rock ‘n’ roll lore, as she famously gave her favorite Runaways belt to Sid Vicious who, in turn, wore the belt until his early demise. [9] X Research source So don’t forget this essential cog in Jett’s machine when assembling your outfit for the day. The classic two- or three-tiered studded belt is a Jett-essential, as well as belts with two or three rows of metal grommets."
