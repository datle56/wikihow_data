If you have some dirty canvas sneakers, you can easily get them clean by throwing them in the washing machine, just as you would any other dirty garment. You may also be able to wash some non-canvas sneakers in the washing machine, but check the manufacturer's instructions before attempting it, as not all sneakers are machine washable.

      "content": "Get tough grime off of your soles. If you have sticky substances on the sole of your shoes, regular cleaning may not be enough to get rid of it. Luckily, it's fairly easy to get even nasty things like gum and tar off of your shoes. If the sticky substance is not dry, place your shoes in the freezer inside of a freezer-safe bag for a few hours. This should cause the substance to become brittle, so you can scrape it off. If you have tar on your shoes and normal cleaning doesn't do the trick, apply a tar and sap remover. These products are typically designed for automotive use, so always check the label to make sure it's safe for rubber. You can also try WD-40 or baby oil. [14] X Research source"
