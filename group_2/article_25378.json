Lightly press on your stomach around the area you were injured. If it feels swollen, painful, tight, full, or more tense than usual, you may be bleeding internally.

If you notice this, call an ambulance immediately. Blood in the abdomen can be a sign that you have ruptured one of your internal organs, which can be incredibly dangerous if not treated promptly."

Locate the area where you injured yourself and look for any immediate or dark bruising in the area. This, alongside intense pain, can be a sign of very serious internal bleeding. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If the pain is more severe than what you may expect from the visible injuries, there’s a chance that there is a more serious injury that you cannot see. It’s always safer to assume something more is wrong than it is to assume you are overreacting to an injury. Significant pain in an area may also be a sign of a broken bone or another ailment. You should always seek help if you're in a lot of pain, but it's not necessarily due to internal bleeding. If you’re taking a blood thinner, you may have an increased risk of bruising and internal bleeding."

[7] X Research source If you cannot breathe easily, find someone who is able to keep you calm, help you breathe and watch over you while you wait for help to arrive. Breathing difficulties can be incredibly dangerous if not resolved quickly. Depending on how you've injured yourself, you may have just had the wind knocked out of you.
