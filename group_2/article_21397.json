If the seed has a frailer stem, keep it in the original paper towel but cut small holes for the leaves to emerge through. If the seed has a stronger stem, feel free to cover only the roots in wet paper towels and let the stem straighten out and grow leaves."

      "content": "If you chose a plant that bears fruit, watch for flower buds growing near the leaves. They will open and dry up, leaving behind the start of a fruit or vegetable. If the plant needs cross-pollination in order to be fertilized, place the plant outside or near an open window for a few days so that insects can do the job. A good plant for hydroponic gardening is one that self pollinates."
