      "content": "Spend time doing enjoyable things together. One way to better your relationship with your boyfriend is to do things together that you both enjoy. Finding joy in the time you spend together can help the two of you build a stronger friendship and a deeper bond. If you like each other more, your relationship will be better. For example, you can play card games, go for hikes, try new activities, or volunteer together. The idea is to do something you both enjoy. Discuss things you like to do, then find a few you have in common. Try to avoid doing the same things you always do. If you aren’t happy with where your relationship is now, doing the same thing over and over isn’t going to help it improve. Ask your boyfriend, \"What do you like to do when we're not together? These are things I like to do.\" You may say, \"I saw there's a new musical in town. I've always wanted to see one. Would you like to go with me?\""

      "content": "Show him that you appreciate him. After you have been with someone for a long time, you might start to take for granted that he knows how you feel about him. Maybe you’re not in that honeymoon phase anymore, but you want him to know how you feel about. Let him know that you care and appreciate everything he does. For example, you can thank him for paying for dinner, for taking out the trash, or for holding the door open for you. Say, \"I really appreciate how you took the trash out last night\" or \"Thank you for the coffee you brought me. It made my morning.\" Tell him how good you think he looks, how you like the beard he’s grown out, or that you like his new cologne. Tell him, \"That shirt looks so great on you\" or \"I love that new haircut. It makes you look handsome.\" Dress nice for him. Wear his favorite shirt, the underwear he likes you in, or the fragrance he likes the smell of."

      "content": "Show him affection. If you’ve been in a relationship for awhile, you may have stopped being as affectionate or physically loving with each other outside of sex. Sex and affection are two different things. Show more affection outside of the bedroom. Just make small changes to show more affection when you are together. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, you can touch him more when you talk, hold his hand, or rest your head on his shoulder. Be present when you kiss him instead of a quick distracted peck. Spend time holding each other and cuddling when you watch television."

      "content": "Do small things for him. You don’t have to make a sweeping romantic gesture to get your relationship back on track. Small things are sometimes more meaningful than large gestures. Start doing small, thoughtful things for your boyfriend when you are together. This will show him that you care, pay attention, and think about him. [2] X Research source For example, bring him his favorite flavor of coffee when you get together in the morning, or have his coffee waiting when he wakes up. Buy his favorite snack food at the grocery store, or pick it up before you go to the movies. If your partner always loses his pens at work, buy him a pack to keep in his car. Keep an extra pair of sunglasses in your car for him if he always forgets his."

You don’t just have to be serious with one another to improve the relationship. Joking with each other, acting silly, and engaging in lighthearted activities that make you both laugh can make you feel closer to one another. [3] X Research source Lightly tease each other about things, bring up inside jokes, and smile or laugh when the other one says something funny. Remember that any teasing or joking should be fun and playful, not mean-spirited."

      "content": "Talk to your boyfriend. This might seem obvious, but if you’ve been with someone for awhile, you may take certain things for granted. You may have stopped sharing things with one another, asking each other questions, or telling each other things that have changed. Get to know your boyfriend again by making an effort to talk. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Find out if your boyfriend has any new hobbies, interests, or favorite movies. Ask him if there are things that bug him, or if anything else has changed that you may have missed. For example, you might ask, \"What new TV shows or movies have you watched lately? Have you found any great new songs?\" or \"I've noticed you've been reading a lot of fantasy lately. That's new.

If you are arguing, don’t get so upset that you ignore what he is saying in favor or getting your point across. Instead, listen to what he has to say. Listening to each other will help you come to a resolution instead of continuing arguing. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source When you listen, actually listen. Turn off the voices in your head that are screaming the points you want to make, how wrong he is, and how you can get him to side with you. To be an active listener, you should use open body language, looking at the person directly and nodding. Pay attention to what the person is saying, and restate what they say back to you (for example, \"It sounds like you're having a pretty hard time at work!\"). Make good eye contact, and provide thoughtful comments and questions about what the person is saying. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Be honest. One way to better the relationship with your boyfriend is to be honest with him. This may be difficult, but if you want to have a good, healthy relationship, both of you need to trust each other enough to open up and be honest. Be honest about things that bother you, things that scare you, or things that make you uneasy. Avoid lying to your boyfriend. This will only cause problems down the road. Being honest doesn’t mean just tell him when he bothers you. This means being honest about all aspects of your life. Work on opening up to him and trusting him."

      "content": "Talk in person. If there is something important you need to discuss with your boyfriend, do it in person instead of via text or e-mail. This helps avoid miscommunication. You need to also find the right time to talk in person. Choose a time when you both have time to talk and when you can be alone. Refrain from attacking your boyfriend when you talk. This doesn’t lead to any productive resolution."

Ask your boyfriend about the new video game he’s playing, his intramural baseball team, or what he thought of the last episode of a television show. [8] X Research source Tell him about the little things in your life, too. Share all aspects of your life with each other, not just the big important things. Don’t get bored when your boyfriend goes on and on about something you don’t care about. If he’s taking the time to share it with you, it must mean something to him. For example, you may share things like, \"We got a new employee at work\" or \"My dog did the funniest thing.\" You may also say, \"I watched this really great movie\" or \"I had a great workout this morning.

Focus on goals that you both share. Sharing common goals can help you both work towards something together, which can be fulfilling and make you closer.

Maybe you hate the way he does something or get offended when he says something. Try to get out of the habit of being negative about your boyfriend. Instead of automatically getting annoyed, think about why he is doing the thing that bothers you. Is it really a problem, or is it a common action that has just started getting on your nerves?

Instead, put your phone away and pay attention to him. Make sure he does the same for you. [10] X Research source If you are paying attention to your phone, you might miss something he is saying.

Don't use generalizations, like \"always\" or never.\" Focus on the issue at hand; don't bring past arguments into the present one. Try to stay calm, and talk about the issue only when you are calm. Be communicative. Don't give your boyfriend the silent treatment. Talk about your feelings; do not use actions to show how you feel. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Have different interests. A good way to better your relationship with your boyfriend is to have interests outside of him. You and your boyfriend should share interests and do things together, but you shouldn’t do everything together. Having different interests keeps things interesting, gives you things to talk about and tell each other about, and helps you both cultivate other relationships. It’s important to keep your individual selves even when growing closer. [13] X Research source It’s okay if you like playing music but he likes art, or if you like baseball and he likes football. You can both enjoy these other interests with each other, but it’s perfectly fine for you to go to a baseball game with your friends while he goes to an art opening with his friends."

[14] X Research source Your relationship will be better when you find ways to be happy. This might be through friendship with others, volunteering, sports, hobbies, or academics.

If you have good self-esteem , you won’t feel as insecure or jealous. Instead, you will trust yourself and your boyfriend more. Don’t base your worth and self-esteem on your boyfriend. Your self-esteem should come from inside you. Base it on your positive attributes and characteristics. Find ways to be confident in yourself. Dress nicely, be proud of your accomplishments, exercise, and try new hobbies. These are all ways to build confidence."
