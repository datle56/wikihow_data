      "content": "Choose phrases with few vowels to stump your opponent. Most of the time when you're playing Hangman , your opponent will guess vowels first because they’re common in words—using up to five guesses. If a Hangman phrase has very few (or no) vowels, they’ll have a harder time figuring out the word. Just make sure they’re a good sport—some of these secret words will be frustrating to decipher.

Think of words that put together letters you don’t normally see together—like ‘ph,’ ‘phth,’ and ‘yt.’ Even if your opponent uncovers some letters, they’ll have a hard time guessing the whole word from these uncommon letter combos.

These are fun terms to try in a Hangman game, as your opponent will eventually have to read the humorous phrase aloud. Because of their unserious nature, they may also be uncommon, making them difficult to guess.

      "content": "The hardest Hangman word is \"jazz.\" In 2010, mathematician Jon McLoone calculated that jazz is the hardest Hangman word to guess after simulating 50 games for each word from a 90,000-word dictionary. \"Jazz\" was missed by the guesser’s algorithm the most. [14] X Research source He theorized that this was because \"jazz\" was both a short word, meaning there were fewer possible correct letters to guess, and because it contained the low-frequency letters ‘j’ and ‘z’."

      "content": "Use a random word or phrase generator. Cure a creative dry spell by letting an algorithm pick your secret word or phrase. Because it’s random, the generated phrase has less of a chance of being familiar to you and the other player. Run the generator a few times to find a difficult word with infrequent letters, few vowels, or many similar letters. For example, The Word Finder lets you generate a number of short or long phrases to use in your game."

      "content": "Set boundaries on how obscure phrases can be. Trying to stump someone with uncommon, archaic, or ridiculous words and phrases is fun—but it also affects how fair the game feels to play. Before playing, ask if the other player or players are okay with guessing obscure words or if they’d rather stick to familiar ones. Apply the same rules no matter who’s making up the secret word or phrase and who’s guessing."

      "title": "Mix challenging words with more common ones.",
      "content": "Mix challenging words with more common ones. To make the game more equitable, alternate between common and uncommon words and phrases. For example, start with a familiar word like “balloon,” then challenge them to guess “quietude.” You can also work your way up from easy words to obscure ones—and if you’re keeping score, make harder phrases worth more points."

      "title": "Choose short words over long words.",
      "content": "Choose short words over long words. While it might feel counterintuitive, shorter words can be harder to guess in a game of Hangman. Think of it this way: there are more 4- and 5-letter words than there are 9-letter words. Short words mean fewer possible correct guesses, forcing your opponent to run through many letters before they land on one that’s in the secret phrase. [15] X Research source"
