      "content": "Choose a spot with temperatures between 75–85 °F (24–29 °C). Black pepper is native to tropical climates and thrives when the temperature is between 75–85 °F (24–29 °C). If temperatures fall to 60 °F (16 °C), the plant begins to die. [1] X Research source Black pepper can be grown indoors or inside a greenhouse if you live in a colder climate. Growing zones 10 and 11 are ideal for black pepper. If you're not sure what growing zone you live in, you can look it up online."

      "content": "Find an area with partial shade to plant your black pepper. Black pepper needs between 6 to 8 hours of indirect sunlight per day. Choose a place in your garden that receives mixed shade and sunlight throughout the day, or place your plant near a window that receives periodic sunlight. If you live in a cloudy climate, purchase a sunlamp for your plant. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Install a trellis into the ground where you plant your black pepper. As black pepper plants grow, its vines can reach up to 15 feet (4.6 m) long. A trellis can keep your plant's vines from getting trampled. Dig two post holes for the trellis at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the plant and press the trellis legs into the hole firmly. Follow the trellis instructions to secure the trellis in the ground so it can support the black pepper vines. Pepper plants can also make great hanging plants during their first year when they're young and their vines are not as long. [3] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source If you want to be more efficient with space (or you have an agroforestry or permaculture growing system), you can grow black pepper up existing trees and use these trees as a trellis for the black pepper vine. Make sure the tree you're using is large enough so it won't end up getting strangled out by the pepper vine."

      "title": "Plant your black pepper plant in well-draining soil.",
      "content": "Plant your black pepper plant in well-draining soil. Black pepper thrives best in rich soil that drains easily. To test whether your soil is well-draining, dig a small hole, 12–18 inches (30–46 cm) across and 12–18 inches (30–46 cm) deep, in your garden and fill it with water. Count how many seconds it takes for the hole to empty. If the hole takes between 5 to 15 minutes to empty, you have well-draining soil. [4] X Research source Use a soil pH tester kit to make sure the soil you're using has a pH between 5.5 and 7. Add compost, sand, silt, peat, or loam to make soil well-draining.

      "content": "Soak your black pepper seeds for 24 hours before planting. Hard, dry seeds will be less responsive to the soil's nutrients. Fill a small bowl with water and let your pepper seeds soak for at least a day prior to planting. [6] X Research source Lukewarm or room temperature water is ideal for soaking your seeds. The type of water doesn't matter—tap water is fine. If you prefer to plant cuttings in your garden, you do not need to let them soak beforehand."

If you are planting multiple black pepper seeds or cuttings, give them 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of space to grow.

      "content": "Start your black pepper seeds indoors if you live in a cold climate. Fill a tray or container with soil and plant your black pepper seeds 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) below the surface. Spread the seeds apart so they're 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from each other. Water the seeds immediately after planting them. Keep the seeds indoors for about 30 days before transferring them outside. Keep the soil the seeds are in warm and moist during the 30 days the seeds are inside. It may help to place the seeds next to a heat source."

      "title": "Water your plant 2 to 3 times per week.",
      "content": "Water your plant 2 to 3 times per week. Black pepper plants need damp soil and grow best when watered several times a week. In hotter climates, you may need to water your plant more often. Stick a finger in the soil to check its moisture level; if the soil feels dry or hot, water your plant. Warm or cool water is preferred to cold water, as black pepper plants are sensitive to cold temperatures."

      "content": "Fertilize the pepper plant every 2 weeks. Applying a fertilizer twice a month can keep your plant healthy and strong. Purchase an organic fertilizer from the store or make your own compost to give your plant supplemental nutrients. Spread the fertilizer around and in the soil (by tiller or by hand) so your pepper plant can absorb the nutrients. How much fertilizer you use depends on its strength. Read the instructions as you use your fertilizer to determine how much your black pepper plant needs. Black pepper plants respond particularly well to liquid fertilizers."

      "title": "Mulch your plant twice per year.",
      "content": "Mulch your plant twice per year. Pepper plants have a shallow root system and soak in organic nutrients well. Mulching your plant every 6 to 8 months can keep the soil damp and reduce temperature fluctuations during the day and night. Organic mulches made of grass clippings, leaves, or manures work well with pepper plants. Plant your mulch at least 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) below the ground, so your plant's roots can more fully absorb it."

      "content": "Avoid overwatering your plant to prevent wilting. Quick and slow wilt are the most common pepper plant diseases, and they can progress to root rot when untreated. Dip your finger into the soil whenever you water your plant. If the soil feels drenched or water pools into the hole your finger leaves, do not water your plant. Watch for signs of overwatering, like yellow or brown leaves, wilted vines, moldy roots, or blisters or lesions on the plant."

Pluck the berries from the plant one at a time, working carefully to avoid plucking unripe berries. Bring a container with you as you harvest your pepper plant, to put the berries inside. [9] X Research source Not all peppercorn berries will mature at the same time. You may need to harvest your plant several times in a single season."
