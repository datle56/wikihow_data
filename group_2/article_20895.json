If you are a medical professional who will be performing an anorectal exam, then your first step should be to explain to your patient what the exam entails. Then, have the patient sign a consent form if they agree to undergo the procedure. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You could explain the procedure by saying something like, “For this exam, I will be inserting a gloved finger into your rectum to check for abnormalities. You may experience some pressure and/or discomfort, but the exam only takes a minute or two.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sanitize your hands and wear gloves. Before performing any type of physical exam on a patient/person, it's important to wash and sanitize your hands because you don't want to transfer any bacteria, viruses, or parasites to them. Using warm water with soap is usually adequate, but you may want to use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel also. Dry your hands thoroughly and then put on a new pair of nitrile or latex-free examination gloves. In the medical field, digital rectal exams (DRE) are typically done by your family doctor, gynecologist, proctologist, or nurse practitioner.

Giving and receiving a digital rectal exam can be awkward or embarrassing for people, so acting professionally and reassuring the patient/person is important. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source After explaining the procedure in general, ask the patient/person to remove their bottoms, lay off their side (typically left side down), bend their knees, and place their hands near their chest — this is essentially the fetal position or on their left side with their knees flexed. Keep them covered with a gown or blanket for privacy and warmth. Place a protective pad under their buttocks as well. [7] X Research source DRE can be done with the patient/person standing. Women may be examined as part of the pelvic exam therefore they may be laying back with their feet in stirrups. Men are often examined while they are standing up unless they are feeling nervous and then laying down may be more comfortable. Laying on their side is often more relaxing and provides better access to the anal canal. To feel more comfortable, it may be best to have a DRE carried out by someone of the same gender. Man on man or woman on woman, a request for a nurse to be present is also an option. It may also help ease anxiety and vulnerability to have a friend or family member present during the exam. Position and drape the patient for warmth as well as privacy."

      "content": "Apply warm lubricant to your index finger. As a courtesy and to prevent the patient/person from being too shocked and uncomfortable, make sure the lubricant is warmed up a little before applying some to your index finger. Even room-temperature gel can feel cool and cause the anal canal to contract, which makes the digital exam more challenging. The goal is to have the anal tissue as relaxed as possible, so inserting a finger doesn't become uncomfortable or painful. [8] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Sometimes a rectal examination is carried out using a local anesthetic in order to numb the anal area and reduce discomfort. This is particularly true if the examiner has large fingers and the examinee has an especially tight anal sphincter.

[10] X Research source Alternatively, most gels and lubricants can be warmed in a microwave for 20-30 seconds."

Once your finger and the anus are lubricated with warm gel, part the patient's / person's buttocks and slowly insert your index finger. It's best to ask the patient/person to take a deep breath during the insertion of the finger in order to relax them and prevent them from contracting their anal sphincter. [11] X Research source To facilitate the insertion of the finger, slowly rotate or twist your hand at your wrist in a back and forth motion. [12] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Right before inserting your finger, quickly assess the anus for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids (swollen blood vessels), warts, rashes or fissures (tissue tears).

Once you're finished with your assessment, slowly remove your index finger and examine the glove for the presence of any blood and/or mucus. Then clean off any lubricant around the anus and remove and dispose of your gloves, and wash your hands. Allow the patient to wipe themselves off in privacy with some soft tissue paper and let them know they can get dressed. [18] X Research source To remove your soiled glove, take your index finger of your other hand (which should be clean), place it under the cuff of the soiled glove, then pull down towards your fingers and peel it off. The exam itself shouldn't cause bleeding, so if you see blood on your glove that could be a signs of hemorrhoids or another internal problems. After the procedure, check to see how the patient is feeling, especially if he was nervous before the procedure began. Also, keep in mind that going from a laying to standing position can make some people feel faint, so encourage the patient to do this slowly and observe them for a few minutes."

Go for yearly checkups or more often if you think there might be a problem. If your doctor thinks your prostate feels abnormal, they will likely order a blood test and look for your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. High PSA levels sometimes indicate prostate cancer.
