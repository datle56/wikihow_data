      "content": "Use a dark-colored bottle to hold your perfume. Using a dark, amber-colored bottle is important because it helps preserve your fragrance by keeping the light out. Always shake your perfume before applying it so the scents mix within the bottle. When storing your bottle, keep it out of direct sunlight to ensure the oils stay fragrant. Try using an amber roller bottle for essential oils . These allow you to roll the perfume on your skin directly rather than spritzing it on.

      "content": "Add 15-20 drops of your base note. The first step to creating your fragrance is adding a base note or the scent that lasts the longest in your perfume. [2] X Research source Base notes are often earthy scents that provide a lasting smell and can be 5 to 20 percent of your blend, but this varies. It's your personal preference, so experiment to see what scents you like. If you aren't sure where to start, follow this guideline: [3] X Research source For a fresh and energizing perfume, add 17 drops of peppermint oil to your perfume bottle or roller bottle. For a floral and romantic blend, add 15 drops of ylang ylang oil . For a sensual and earthy fragrance, add 20 drops of vetiver oil ."

      "content": "Mix in 10-15 drops of your middle note. The middle note is the heart of your fragrance, the smell that appears after your top note has dissipated. [4] X Research source Some people choose to use a more floral scent for this note, but once again, it’s all about preference. Middle notes are usually the biggest portion of your blend (50 to 80 percent), but once again, this varies with experimentation. Here are some suggestions following the previous recipes: [5] X Research source For a fresh and energizing perfume, add 10 drops of lime essential oil . For a romantic and floral blend, add 10 drops of orange essential oil . For a sensual, earthy fragrance, add 14 drops of ginger essential oil ."

[6] X Research source This note is often 5 to 20 percent of the blend, but you can add more or less if you choose. Some prefer fruity, minty, or refreshing scents for their top note. Try out different scents if you're unsure to see what you like the best, or follow these guidelines to finish the previous blends: [7] X Research source For an energizing, fresh blend, add 10 drops of lavender oil . For a floral, romantic perfume, add 10 drops of rose essential oil . For an earthy, sensual fragrance, add 10 drops of cedarwood essential oil ."

      "content": "Add 1 to 4 fl oz (2.0 to 8.0 US tbsp) perfumer’s alcohol to dilute. Making an essential oil perfume with alcohol isn’t necessary, but the alcohol can help the fragrance last longer. Opt for a perfumer’s alcohol (which doesn’t have a scent) for the best results. [8] X Research source If you’re using 60 or so drops of essential oils, use 3 to 4 fl oz (6.0 to 8.0 US tbsp) of alcohol. If you used 20 to 30 drops of essential oil, use 1 to 2 fl oz (2.0 to 4.0 US tbsp) of alcohol. Avoid using rubbing alcohol in your perfume, as the strong chemical odor can upset the balanced aroma of your perfume. [9] X Research source For a more natural alternative, try a carrier oil like jojoba , sweet almond , or grapeseed . These oils have a minimal odor and work best in a roller ball bottle."

      "title": "Shake your perfume, let it rest for a month, and then use it.",
      "content": "Shake your perfume, let it rest for a month, and then use it. After you’ve added all your ingredients to your fragrance, shake it up. This will allow the scents to fuse and mingle. Then, if you’re patient enough, let the perfume sit for about a month before using it. While you can use it beforehand, the scents will meld and become stronger the longer it rests. A perfume made out of essential oils may smell great right away, but over time, the scents could combine into something that doesn't smell too great. Allowing your perfume to sit will give you a better idea of what your combined scents will smell like for the majority of the perfume's life. Keep your perfume in a cool, dry place for the best results. Apply the perfume to your pulse points, such as your wrists, inner arms, the backs of your ears, and your sternum."
