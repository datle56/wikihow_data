      "content": "Select a rubber or other non-metal hook to hold your bikes. Check your local hardware store or sporting goods shop to find a rubber hook, or a hook that isn’t made of bare metal. Look for a piece of equipment that’s about 0.3 in (0.76 cm) thick, so you can hang it in your storage area without it taking up too much space. [1] X Research source Don’t use metal hooks for long-term storage, as these can scrape and damage the wheels of your bike. Make sure the hooks you use are rated to support the weight of your bike so you don't damage your ceiling. [2] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."

      "content": "Find a section of your ceiling that won’t interfere with your vehicles. Search in your cellar, attic, garage or other storage area for a place where your bikes can stay for a long period of time. Depending on the height of your ceiling, you might not want to keep your bike in the center of your storage space. [3] X Research source If you aren’t sure whether or not your bike will be able to fit safely to your garage ceiling, take a quick measurement of your ceiling, vehicle, and bike’s height to make sure."

      "content": "Tap the ceiling with your hand to find the ceiling joists. Set up a ladder to reach the ceiling. If the surface is covered in drywall, tap around the ceiling to find a solid area. Once you’ve found a solid spot, mark it with a pencil or some other writing tool. [4] X Research source Hollow areas will sound echoey when you tap on them, while solid areas will sound firm. If your ceiling has beams instead of drywall, you don’t have to worry about this. If you’re having difficulty finding the ceiling joists, you can also use a stud finder ."

      "title": "Measure the hook’s diameter to choose a proper drill bit.",
      "content": "Measure the hook’s diameter to choose a proper drill bit. Examine the rubber hook that you’re planning to hang from your ceiling. Measure the diameter of the screw, then select an electric drill bit that’s about ⅔ of the screw’s width. Always use a drill bit that’s smaller in diameter than the hook that you’re using. When the bit is slightly smaller, you can firmly and securely install the hook into the ceiling. [5] X Research source If your drill bit is too large, your hook might be too loose."

      "content": "Install a second hook if you want to hang your bike by 2 wheels. Measure the distance between the center axles of your bike wheels. Once your first hook is in place, use a tape measure to mark off that same distance from the initial hook. Drill a guiding hole through this mark, then twist a second bike hook into place. [8] X Research source If you’re planning on hanging up several bikes, use this measuring system to install multiple hooks."

      "content": "Wipe down your bike with a wet paper towel. Take a damp paper towel or disinfectant wipe and clean off any visible dust, sweat or grime from your bike. Try and clean off all sections of the bike, as you don’t want any dust or debris falling and clogging up the chains and gears of your bike while it's in storage. [9] X Research source Sweat can be commonly found on most bikes, especially if you use your equipment a lot. Try to wipe away sweat as soon as you see it, or it could drip further into your bike."

      "content": "Acquire a pulley kit from your local hardware store. Before you begin any construction in your storage area, head to a hardware store or sporting goods shop to purchase a “bike pulley” or “bike hoist” kit. These kits generally include 2 pulley brackets, 2 hooks, a length of cord, and the screws needed for installation. You can save a lot of time by purchasing these supplies in a bundle, instead of searching for each part individually. [12] X Research source You can get a pulley kit for as low as $9."

Depending on the place you’re storing your bikes, you might see visible beams and joists that you can use for your pulley system. If your ceiling is obscured or otherwise covered, tap on a specific area and listen for a firm or echoing sound. If the resonating sound is firm, then you’ve found a joist. [13] X Research source Try measuring 16 in (41 cm) to find another ceiling joist, just to make sure. [14] X Research source"

Don’t worry about the exact measurements of your bike at this point. Instead, use your hand to hold the pulley in place, and use an electric drill to secure 4 screws into the corresponding bracket holes. [15] X Research source Depending on your storage space, you might have difficulty attaching the screws in the joist right off the bat. In this case, use your drill bit to form as many pilot holes as there are openings in the bracket. This will make it easier for you to add screws later on. You’ll need bike measurements when attaching the second pulley bracket."

      "content": "Thread and knot the pulley cord through the second bracket. Pull a section of your pulley cord through the back opening of your bracket. Use a firm knot to keep the cord in place, so the pulley system is secure. Once you’ve knotted the rope, let the rest of the cord dangle. [18] X Research source Figure-eight knots are good for this kind of project. The hole for the pulley cord is separate from the openings for the screws. Look for the end of the pulley that has an extra opening to figure out where the cord goes."

      "content": "Attach a heavy-duty adhesive hook to the wall. Pull off the backing paper from 1 side of the adhesive strip, then firmly press the sticky side of the strip to the wall. Next, remove the other section of backing paper from the adhesive. Take the back of the hook structure and press it firmly onto the sticky strip for several seconds to successfully set it up. [21] X Research source Try choosing an adhesive hook with “utility” or “heavy-duty” on the label. While your pulley cord won’t be that heavy, you don’t want to use a flimsy hook. Always follow the instructions on the hook’s packaging."

      "title": "Tie any extra cord to the hook on the lower wall.",
      "content": "Tie any extra cord to the hook on the lower wall. Leave 1 to 2 yards (0.91 to 1.83 m) of cord dangling from the pulley, so you can securely lift and lower your bike from your storage area. Loop the extra cord around the wall hook, so you can unspool it whenever you need to access your bike. If you don’t leave enough slack for your pulley system, your bike hoist might not function properly. [22] X Research source If you have more than 1 pulley system hooked up in your storage area, be sure to have separate wall hooks to prevent the cords from tangling."

      "content": "Secure the hooks to the handlebars and bike seat. Take 1 hook and attach it beneath the back of your bike seat. Next, take the second hook and arrange it beneath the piping of your handlebars. Before you do anything else, check that these hooks are secure, and that they aren’t going to shift and separate from the bike. [23] X Research source Ideally, your hooks should have a rubber seal. If your hooks are only made of metal, then they might scratch your handlebars."
