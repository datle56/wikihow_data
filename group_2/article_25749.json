      "title": "Practice basic coding so you can program your robots.",
      "content": "Practice basic coding so you can program your robots. Coding is a foundational element of robotics, and you will need to know how to use variables, create conditional statements, use functions, and other basic coding skills. Choose a coding language and study it on your own or take coding classes to improve your skills. [1] X Research source The most popular coding languages for robotics are Python and C++. Websites like Free Code Camp are good resources. There are also boot camps that you can go to for a period of time to learn coding or software engineering."

      "title": "Learn linear algebra to prepare you for building robots.",
      "content": "Learn linear algebra to prepare you for building robots. Basic algebra is essential for both programming a robot and tweaking its code. Take plenty of algebra courses in high school or college, or study algebra on your own to strengthen your mathematical skills. [2] X Research source If you have trouble with mathematics and are still a student, talk to your math teacher or professor for help. Many pre- and post-secondary schools also have math help labs to teach struggling students key concepts."

    {
      "title": "Study physics as a background for learning robotics.",
      "content": "Study physics as a background for learning robotics. Building robots involves understanding how your robot moves and interacts with the outside world. If you haven't taken a physics course before, enroll in an online program or learn basic physics on your own. [3] X Research source Many web-based institutions, like KhanAcademy and The Open University, offer physics, mathematics, and even computer science courses for free."

    {
      "title": "Study computer science to strengthen your robotics skill.",
      "content": "Study computer science to strengthen your robotics skill. Robotics is strongly connected to computer science, and a strong understanding of the latter is key to learning the former. Practice or study basic computer skills and try to keep up-to-date on articles or websites about computer science. [4] X Research source Many community colleges offer online or in-person computer science courses at a reduced cost, even if you don't enroll in a program."

    {
      "title": "Build your robot using a kit or on your own to build your first robot.",
      "content": "Build your robot using a kit or on your own to build your first robot. Once you've learned the basic skills for robotics, purchase a robot building kit and build your robot using coding, mathematics, and manual tinkering based on the kit's instructions. Alternatively, you can also build your own using parts and tools you can purchase from most hardware stores. [5] X Research source You can buy robot building kits online or from many electronics stores. Start with simple robots and, as you gain experience, move on to complex models over time."

    {
      "title": "Take robotics courses in-person or online to strengthen your skills.",
      "content": "Take robotics courses in-person or online to strengthen your skills. While studying robotics on your own is helpful, robotics courses can teach you advanced techniques. Ask your local colleges or community centers if they offer robotics classes, or enroll in an online course to either develop or strengthen your robotics skills. [6] X Research source If you don't have the time for a robotics class, you can try reading books or articles on robotics instead."

      "title": "Join a robotics club to share your passion with others and receive advice.",
      "content": "Join a robotics club to share your passion with others and receive advice. Robotics is not just a hobbyâ€”if you're interested in building robots with other people, it can also be a way to make lasting friendships. Join a robotics club at your school or community center to share your hobby with other people and learn new ways to build robots. [7] X Research source If you can't find any robotics clubs in your area, consider starting your own instead."

      "title": "Enter robotics competitions when you're ready to showcase your projects.",
      "content": "Enter robotics competitions when you're ready to showcase your projects. Once you've learned how to program basic robots, enroll your inventions in a local or large robotics competition. No matter how you do, robotics competitions can be a great way to test your robots and learn ways to make them better. [8] X Research source If you're not comfortable entering a competition, you can always attend one first. Not only can you get a feel for what robotics competitions are like, but you can also find inspiration for your robots by watching all of the different competitions."

      "title": "Learn trigonometry and statistics for advanced robotics.",
      "content": "Learn trigonometry and statistics for advanced robotics. While linear algebra is sufficient for basic robots, you may need to learn advanced mathematics to build complex ones. Study trigonometry or statistics on your own, or take a course online or with a local college. [9] X Research source If you struggle with advanced mathematics, ask a fellow robotics hobbyist for advice. They may be able to relate mathematics to skills you both know and understand to make learning new concepts easier."

      "title": "Study the Robot Operating System to customize your projects.",
      "content": "Study the Robot Operating System to customize your projects. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the most common software system for building robots. If you want to build your complex robots without the help of a kit or guide, learning how to use the ROS can help you program your inventions. [10] X Research source Using ROS requires proficiency in a coding language, preferably C++ or Python. Before you download the ROS, spend time honing your computer programming skills first. You can also take a course in ROS online or at some colleges to learn more about the software and clear up any questions you have."

      "title": "Obtain a degree in robotics engineering if desired.",
      "content": "Obtain a degree in robotics engineering if desired. If you're serious about robotics, a degree in robotics engineering can teach you how to design, troubleshoot, and repair complex robots. Finish a bachelor's degree in robotics engineering to learn more about the robots industry and learn advanced skills. [11] X Research source For schools that don't offer robotics engineering, mechanical engineering can provide similar skills for building and programming robots."
