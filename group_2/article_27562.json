The ingredients you use to make your lipstick base can be tweaked to make the lipstick more glossy, matte, or balm-like. Here's what you need: [1] X Research source 1 teaspoon (5 ml) beeswax or beeswax beads. You can find beeswax at craft supply stores. 1 teaspoon (5 ml) shea butter, mango butter, almond butter, or avocado butter. This helps the lipstick roll on smoothly! 1 teaspoon (5 ml) oil, such as almond oil, extra virgin olive oil, or jojoba oil or oil of soya"

      "content": "Choose a lipstick color. Now that you've got your base supplies, the next step is to pick out a color. There are many natural substances that can be used to create a variety of red, pink, brown, and orange hues. Remember that this lipstick recipe is natural, so the colors you'll look subtle and earth-toned. [2] X Research source Consider these options: For a bright red lipstick, use beetroot powder or crushed beet chips. Cinnamon can be used to achieve a reddish-brown color. Turmeric can be mixed with other powders to make the shade more coppery. Cocoa powder gives lipstick a deep brown hue."

      "content": "Melt the base ingredients together. Put the lipstick base ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl. Place it in the microwave and heat the ingredients in 30-second increments until they are melted. Stir the ingredients well to make sure they are thoroughly incorporated. Note that you can also melt the ingredients in a double-boiler. Heat roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, then add the ingredients to a smaller pan sitting inside the first. Stir and heat until everything melts and blends together."

Stir the powder into the base mixture, and continue adding more (in small increments) until you're satisfied with the color. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Get the eyeshadow ready.",
      "content": "Get the eyeshadow ready. Find an old eyeshadow (or buy a cheap one) in the form of either loose or compacted powder, rather than a gel form. Scoop the eyeshadow into a bowl and use the back of a spoon to mash it up until you've got a fine, lump-free powder. To give the lipstick some shimmer, try adding a little shimmering eyeshadow to the main color you have chosen. Using eyeshadow is a great way to experiment with interesting lipstick colors. Eyeshadows are like color pigments so that's why we use it. Go for green, blue, black, and other colors that are difficult to find in lipstick shades. Note that some eyeshadows are not safe for use on your lips, however. Check the ingredients. If the eyeshadow includes ultramarines, ferric ferrocyanide, and/or chromium oxides, do not use it. Only use eyeshadows that contain safe iron oxides."

Place the bowl in the microwave and heat it until it melts and becomes runny, then stir it up to distribute the color throughout the jelly. Add more powder if you want the eyeshadow to have a more saturated hue. (Darker/Opaque) Add less powder for a tinted lipgloss look. (Lighter/Translucent) Instead of petroleum jelly, you can substitute clear chapstick."

      "content": "Get a box of crayons. The beauty of this method is that you can make beautiful, brightly colored lipstick in just about any shade of the rainbow. Use broken crayons you already have lying around or buy a brand new box just for the purpose of making lipstick. You'll need one crayon per tube. Choose a crayon brand that is known to make crayons that are safe to ingest in small quantities. Since kids often put crayons in their mouths, many brands are tested to ensure they aren't toxic. Choose a box of crayons that is labeled as such. Do not use oil pastels or other professional art supplies, since these are not regulated in the same way as children's crayons. Sniff the crayons before you buy the box. You're going to be putting this on your lips, after all, so you want to make sure you get crayons that don't have a strong smell."

Place the crayon in the top section of the double boiler and heat it over medium heat until it has melted. You can make your own double boiler with two saucepans, a large one and a smaller one. Place a few inches of water in the large saucepan and set the smaller pan inside, so that it's floating on the water. Put the crayon in the smaller saucepan, then place the contraption over medium heat and let the crayon melt. You might want to use an old pan to melt the crayon, since it can be difficult to clean off."

You can use lipsticks of the same shade, or create a new color by choosing several different shades. Make sure that any lipstick you use has not expired. If it's older than two years, it's too old to use and should be discarded."

Alternatively, you can melt the lipsticks together in a double-boiler instead of a microwave. Consider adding about 1 tsp (5 ml) of beeswax or petroleum jelly for every 4 inches (10 cm) of lipstick used, as doing so will add a moisturizing effect to the lipstick. Stir well until blended.
