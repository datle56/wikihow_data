      "content": "Check the size of the canine. Size is an easy way to tell if your dog is an Alaskan Malamute or a Siberian Husky. See if the dog is large or medium-sized. Alaskan Malamutes are larger than Siberian Huskies. They are usually about 22–27.5 inches (56–70 cm) and are considered large. [1] X Research source Siberian Huskies, on the other hand, are considered to be medium-sized. [2] X Research source They are usually about 20–23.5 inches (51–60 cm).

The Alaskan Malamute usually weighs 65–85 pounds (29–39 kg). The Siberian husky, which is lighter than the malamute, usually weighs 35–60 pounds (16–27 kg).

      "content": "Look at the dog's eye color. Eye color is often useful in telling these two breeds apart. Purebred Alaskan Malamutes always have brown eyes. They don't carry the genes for blue eyes. [5] X Research source Siberian Huskies have either light blue or brown eyes. [6] X Research source When their eyes are brown, check the shade of the hue. If it is a light shade, it’s likely a husky, not a malamute."

      "content": "See how the dog’s tail hangs. The tail is often said to be the easiest way to identify the species from each other. If the tail curls over the dog’s back, rather than dropping down directly, it’s an Alaskan Malamute. [7] X Research source If the tail hangs down, with no upwards curl, it’s a Siberian Husky.

Alaskan Malamutes have longer coats than the Siberian Huskies. They are considered long. [9] X Research source Siberian Huskies, on the other hand, have shorter coats.

Alaskan Malamutes have coats that range in color from black and light grey to red.

Malamutes are significantly less energetic than huskies. Alaskan Malamutes are calm dogs. They're less likely to run around or jump.

Alaskan Malamutes prefer pulling over running. [15] X Research source Give it a rope! See if it will play tug-of-war with you. Siberian Huskies, on the other hand, like running over pulling.

[17] X Research source They will dig holes with their paws and keep digging until stopped by something more interesting. Unlike Malamutes, Siberian Huskies like to jump over fences rather than dig under them. [18] X Research source Because of their energetic behavior and personality, jumping is their preferred way of getting past blockages. They also do this when they’re bored. [19] X Research source"

Alaskan Malamutes tend to be more aggressive. [20] X Research source They are usually not tolerant of other dogs. Siberian Huskies are much friendlier. They are outgoing and very tolerant compared to other dogs. [21] X Research source"
